the way uh i'm i'm going to say this
01:52
before i forget to make the announcement
01:53

01:55
might forget if i don't say it
01:57
you know we have cats we have questions
01:59
for cat already for today so we don't
02:01
need those uh our staff decided it would
02:03
be great to have you ask any and all
02:05
kinds of questions about christmas
02:08
as it relates to heaven or whatever cat
02:10
knows is seeing understands so ask your
02:13
questions about christmas for next
02:15
week's broadcast most of the
02:18
people put those questions underneath
02:21
the youtube not in the chat to the right
02:22
but underneath uh where you put your
02:24
comments where they stay there not the
02:26
ones that just disappear and roll off
02:28
the screen
02:29
um and there are other ways we get them
02:31
too some people have hit reply and do
02:33
different things that our preferred
02:35
method is below youtube um and we'll try
02:38
and look at other places as well but
02:39
that's we're going to tell you that
02:40
specific one so i want to thank
02:42
everybody for your amazing donations
02:45
yesterday we pretty much had an
02:47
unprecedented number of donations and we
02:49
really appreciate that this ministry is
02:51
really growing by leaps and bounds uh
02:54
after the first we've got several more
02:55
people we'll be bringing on board in
02:57
fact we'll make those announcements at
02:59
the right time just a few of those
03:01
we will announce like this
03:04
i think that some of you have seen
03:05
illumination who now works for us we we
03:08
got her by making the announcement on
03:10
the
03:11
air so we will be making some
03:12
announcements
03:13
uh either next week or after the first
03:15
i'll see what the staff wants to do and
03:17
then people can then begin to send those
03:19
in so we'll figure out how to do that
03:21
and give you an address
03:23
or email whatever the staff wants and
03:25
we'll tell you which positions we're
03:26
looking for so
03:28
but anyway thank you very much for your
03:29
generosity i know it's the as you we
03:32
approach the year end many of you are
03:34
trying to to determine what you want to
03:36
do with your what things you want to do
03:38
with your um final giving for the year
03:40
we certainly appreciate you thinking
03:42
about us you know i've said that we've
03:44
built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda
03:46
and and then we've doubled the size we
03:48
paid for the construction of doubling
03:51
the size of the health clinic
03:53
on in that ugandan village i haven't
03:54
even shown you that picture yet uh we
03:57
have to work we're committed to do 24 to
03:59
dig 24 new wells in and around that
04:02
community and region and some of you who
04:05
saw that video we'll show it several
04:06
more times you saw that the people were
04:09
drinking
04:10
some of them when the water is running
04:12
off of the piglet tree into the water
04:14
that they they put in their drinking
04:15
water and they bring it home it's just a
04:17
horrific thing so we're digging
04:19
freshwater wells thank you so much for
04:21
your i i would say your help you know
04:24
it's not just you helped us you did it
04:26

05:46
next week you probably heard that and we
05:49

05:51
you talked about christmas town all that
05:52
so i'll have you just kind of elaborate
05:54
on that next week so well
05:57
yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll
06:00
just jump in um before we have any
06:02
questions cat what kind of anything
06:04
current events you'd like to share
06:07
uh
06:08
well i do there are there are things out
06:10
there everybody knows about and things
06:12
people can't know about right now but i
06:14
i can continue to tell you that that
06:17
foundation of the left is crumbling
06:20
um there's other people leaving their
06:22
positions because they're being exposed
06:25
in that is privately
06:27
that i can't announce who that is but
06:30
that big support this is the thing when
06:33
you lose your support like you were
06:35
saying you can't do anything that is
06:36
absolutely true but guess what it's also
06:38
true for the left
06:40
all the people who are jumping on that
06:42
bandwagon are jumping off many of them
06:45
are jumping off some of those are really
06:47
big supporters and i can tell you bottom
06:50
line why i can tell you why they want to
06:52
have money left over
06:54
because they keep being asked for more
06:56
and more and more you can't give
06:57
yourself to something that is totally
07:00
darkness and think they're going to let
07:03
you go how about if i give you that as a
07:05
tip
07:05
you can't do it you can run in
07:07
and agree and participate with things
07:10
that are evil
07:11
and think that will let you go
07:14
i can also tell a story about that there
07:17
are people who were part of an extreme
07:19
dark uh uh thing that was going on this
07:22
is probably maybe 15 years ago
07:24
and they actually had seen demons talk
07:27
to demons and not trying to scare
07:28
anybody they gave permission
07:31
they gave permission and they thought
07:33
what they got to do was exciting and
07:35
amazing but guess what they wouldn't let
07:37
them go they tormented them for the next
07:40
10 years of their life
07:42
and and they just couldn't get rid of
07:44
they didn't get rid of them because you
07:46
can't give yourself to something it's
07:49
like what god says what you enter into
07:52
will enter into you and that's how
07:54
simply something that's one liners of
07:56
some of the most powerful things he ever
07:58
says to me but what you choose to enter
08:00
into will enter into your soul that's
08:02
just what happens and either you think
08:04
about it you want to run after it or
08:06
else you give them a tie to you and
08:08
these people actually gave a tie
08:11
to to this these beings that were um
08:14
beginning to torment them when they were
08:16
done with the fun thing they thought
08:17
they were going to be a part of which
08:18
was dark was really bad i'm not going to
08:20
tell you what that was but they couldn't
08:22
get rid of them finally they had to
08:24
repent
08:25
and and cleanse their soul and every
08:28
every place they lived they had a place
08:30
that the demons would always come in at
08:31
night and torment him they couldn't do
08:33
anything about it
08:34
so they had somebody get hold of me
08:37
i didn't meet with them i told them what
08:39
they would have to do and they could
08:40
never ever go to that place again
08:43
and they would have to just you know
08:45
make sure that they
08:46
got that out of their soul number one
08:48
but they actually had to renounce
08:50
anything or any hold or tie that
08:53
darkness have with them that they gave
08:55
permission to that's the difference and
08:58
people who are just maybe attacked every
09:00
now and then that's it that's illegal
09:02
that's taken to the course of heaven
09:04
sometimes and sometimes god just comes
09:06
in supernaturally and ends that that's
09:09
like an attack this is not what these
09:11
people were doing they willingly
09:13
participated in these evil acts that
09:15
were happening somewhere and that's why
09:18
it took longer to get rid of it they
09:21
finally broke it they have had no no
09:24
nothing else come they stopped coming
09:26
they severed that tie they severed that
09:29
portal that was open by their own
09:31
repentance and then um having to take
09:33
communion over the whole thing and you
09:35
know what they attempted to come back
09:37
but they said they couldn't they served
09:38
only the living god they would not serve
09:41
the enemy again so that's why it's so
09:44
important to make sure you never get
09:46
into one of those places or participate
09:48
like that it's really hard to get rid of
09:50
and that's what people are finding out
09:52
now
09:52
who already have been a part of this
09:54
thing this year and a half long thing
09:56
that's been going on in our country
09:58
more and more people think i can make
10:00
money if i let them use me for this or
10:02
if i lie about this or if i cheat in
10:05
this way i'll make money well they're
10:07
finding out they're losing their money
10:08
that's what's happening they're losing
10:10
their money and once they make a tie or
10:13
a contract with this darkness that's
10:15
going on they won't let you go that's
10:18
why you don't want to participate in the
10:19
beginning you stand strong against
10:21
everything that's going on you keep
10:23
running after god right now in your life
10:26
and don't forget to celebrate he's still
10:28
saying that to me god has already seen
10:30
the beginning to the end he knows
10:32
exactly what will happen and i know
10:34
there's a lot of theories and
10:36
assumptions and people think they know
10:37
what's going to happen i can tell you
10:39
god is going to decide when that does
10:41
happen when it does it will be so great
10:43
you won't have to wonder if you'll hear
10:45
about it so this is just a tip to people
10:47
or those who are still in the darkness
10:49
you better get out while you can if you
10:52
don't you probably will lose everything
10:54
because this is an evil thing happening
10:56
in our country you cannot steal a
10:57
country you cannot give yourself to
10:59
satan or his evil ex and think he will
11:03
let go of you if you're already stepping
11:05
outside of that maybe you never got born
11:07
again you better get bored again really
11:09
quick
11:10
i will say that you better get born
11:11
again because that's probably the one
11:13
thing that can save you from all the
11:15
stuff you've been involved in but
11:17
there's already people they've already
11:18
got some people who are being witnesses
11:20
um to a lot of these accounts that
11:22
excuse me that are happening so i would
11:24
just encourage you and i'm gonna keep
11:26
doing it get out of that darkness while
11:28
you can
11:29
repent make sure you make sure you tell
11:32
somebody who is accountable
11:34
who is an authority in the area that's
11:37
just looking to see what's going on so i
11:40
just want to encourage people those
11:41
things are happening right now people
11:44
are uh they're distancing themselves
11:46
from some people they're actually
11:48
getting out of these things themselves
11:50
but people who have money are finding
11:53
that if something doesn't happen to stop
11:55
this whole thing they themselves will
11:58
have no money or property so let me tell
12:01
you evil will never bless you evil can't
12:04
create life or hope or something that's
12:06
going to help there is no help in evil
12:09
and darkness that comes from god that
12:11
comes from belonging to jesus christ so
12:14
all you who've been out there have been
12:15
strong and stayed strong and given hope
12:18
to people that that god does know what's
12:20
going on don't give up okay you got to
12:22
stay strong it says making your stand
12:24
and standing there for us i just want to
12:26
applaud you
12:28
yeah yeah
12:29
making a great stand for jesus christ
12:33
he made everything we know and see
12:36
nothing is hidden from him so if you
12:38
think because god's not saying anything
12:41
right now to everybody that does not
12:44
mean he doesn't he does have a plan he
12:46
he does he does have a plan for all of
12:48
this that's good ken i think you said
12:50
something a minute ago and i thought you
12:51
know i'm going to ask her to expound on
12:53
that you said people had sold out to
12:55
darkness and you got them into
12:57
repentance and to receiving the lord if
12:59
they hadn't but then you said
13:01
they took communion over that thing or
13:04
something to the that effect and you're
13:06
you're speaking about communion as if
13:08
it's a weapon
13:10
and let me just
13:11
ask you to expand uh expound on the
13:14
weapon of communion what does that
13:16
actually do
13:17
when people take communion
13:19
it is so powerful and
13:22
unfortunately most churches has just
13:24
become a tradition yeah
13:26
i will give you a good example of that i
13:29
remember
13:30
where i was attending at one time it had
13:32
become like a tradition
13:34
that doesn't make god very happy because
13:37
there is power in the blood of jesus
13:39
christ and his surrender totally to the
13:42
father's will and even his own
13:44
willingness to do he didn't have to do
13:47
anything at the cross and no matter what
13:49
people think don't take the crosses off
13:51
your wall now that you think he's not on
13:52
it anymore his own personal mark he
13:55
makes as a carpenter is a cross that's
13:58
what he does even in heaven when he
13:59
makes things that is significant
14:02
it means everything to all those who are
14:04
a believer who have received the the
14:07
sacrifice that christ did and died for
14:09
us he shed his own blood for us that is
14:11
a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks
14:14
things sometimes that nothing else can
14:18
and especially people if they've had
14:20
things going on in their house at night
14:22
maybe they may be familiar spirits or
14:24
other kind of spirits if there's nothing
14:26
else you can do you've prayed maybe
14:28
you've fasted you need to take communion
14:31
yourself over your property and then you
14:33
go outside and you pour some on the land
14:36
and say with the blood of jesus christ i
14:38
redeem this land a shockwave
14:41
of jesus christ will it tell you it will
14:44
embed itself in the property you're
14:46
living on and then you invite holy
14:49
spirit to invade it just invite the
14:51
spirit of god to invade it and let me
14:53
tell you what it'll be hard for anything
14:55
spiritually bad or evil to come on that
14:58
property it would be too painful for
15:00
them
15:00
taking communion is something some
15:03
people actually do every day
15:04
and i do it about once a month myself at
15:07
least sometimes more than that
15:10
and recently we just cleansed our land
15:12
again and let me tell you what the peace
15:15
of god with the presence of god will
15:17
infuse that the presence of god is in
15:19
communion
15:21
it represents many things it represents
15:23
the sec
15:25
reminds us of the sacrifice christ did
15:28
but it's something that brings us
15:30
together if you do that with your family
15:33
it will be so powerful in the spirit it
15:35
brings a bond with you and your family
15:38
together when you take that together
15:40
recognizing together as a family what
15:42
christ did for you
15:44
sometimes it opens things you never
15:46
could get open sometimes it breaks the
15:48
power of the enemy that nothing else
15:50
will break i even tell people who've
15:52
been sick for a long time you should be
15:54
taking communion over your body it says
15:57
very clearly in the bible what you know
16:00
what he did by his stripes what does it
16:03
say
16:04
you are healed okay the blood it helps
16:07
your mind and your mental faculties it
16:10
just does
16:11
physically mentally and emotionally it
16:14
can heal things and break things off of
16:16
you that never could be broken off
16:18
before
16:19
wow
16:20
that's my you know my spiritual father
16:22
wade taylor last five years of his life
16:24
he was my spiritual father he would take
16:27
communion every single day and i believe
16:29
he sometimes several times today his and
16:32
his he believed that the lord had shown
16:34
him that the closest thing we have you
16:36
know the tree of life isn't on the earth
16:38
right now he he strong
16:40
strongly believed that the taking
16:42
communion was the closest thing we had
16:44
to a tree of life on the earth as far as
16:47
the natural
16:48
you know elements that type of thing is
16:50
interesting you know and he was a very
16:51
healthy man until you know finally it
16:53
was his time and suddenly he was gone
16:55
but uh yeah that was i i've never looked
16:57
at communion the same since he since he
16:59
said that because i thought you know
17:01
that what if he's true
17:03
what if it's true that there's so much
17:05
more healing available to us
17:08
there is you know and i remember at
17:10
least i was in at the time that they had
17:12
just did it they were doing it again
17:13
just as a rope thing as a just a normal
17:16
thing they did once a month and god
17:19
yelled from heaven to me it is holy it
17:22
is holy it is holy
17:25
and i'm telling you the presence of god
17:27
fell so strong on me he said you will
17:29
say something about this and
17:32
so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh
17:35
one of the prophets visiting visiting
17:38
and uh
17:39
they read it to the congregation like a
17:41
week later they read it and the power of
17:43
god fell on the entire church and people
17:46
actually got on their knees and repented
17:49
for not taking it for the full uh the
17:51
power of god that was in it the fullness
17:54
of his sacrifices in there well what
17:56
what did he represent he represented
17:58
life hope joy
18:00
healing
18:01
empowerment that's what's in that's
18:04
what's in taking communion that's what
18:06
that means
18:07
that's profound i mean it's just so
18:09
profound yeah when i was raised up but
18:12
i'll get into these questions here when
18:13
i was raised
18:14
in a fundamental church it was like
18:16
every 13 weeks we had a communion they
18:19
even did the foot washing with it and
18:20
all that but it was like if we could
18:22
figure out a way to get out of that
18:24
particular
18:25
uh church service and stay home and once
18:28
in a while we'd figure out something
18:29
like let's go to the beach today it was
18:32
it was just a ritual there was no power
18:35
in it and we just looked for ways to get
18:37
out boy i would never do that
18:39
you know with my
18:40
understanding
18:42
it's very powerful here's
18:44
here's the first question um
18:46
this is a two-part i'll just read them
18:48
both but my mother was in her last days
18:50
in the hospital in hospice she kept
18:52
telling me about these beautiful atriums
18:55
she kept seeing i personally believe god
18:57
was showing her glimpses of heaven
18:59
before she passed so question when are
19:01
there
19:01
atriums in heaven and two does god
19:04
reveal heaven to people in their last
19:07
hours or moments to comfort them or to
19:09
prepare them before they die
19:11
um well that the last part is absolutely
19:14
true some people it's their first
19:17
glimpse of not just having
19:20
many people in their last maybe maybe
19:22
the last week especially they'll begin
19:24
to see family members who are in heaven
19:26
they'll just
19:27
see their faces or something sometimes
19:29
they might hear them say something
19:31
that's not like they're going to abide
19:32
there with them but he is letting them
19:35
have glimpses of having something else
19:37
they'll see many times are their own
19:39
angels
19:40
or or they'll just see angels in the
19:42
room that's really a clue that they're
19:44
probably not going to stay very long
19:46
and but if everything jesus christ
19:49
unless they walk up and he walks up to
19:50
him and say you know you will live and
19:53
not die or it's not your time but
19:55
sometimes he'll catch them up there and
19:57
tell them there and then send them back
19:59
but if if they begin to tell you that
20:01
i've seen jesus then that either means
20:04
they're going to be fully healed or
20:05
they're going to be fully healed by
20:06
going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of
20:09
that happens sometimes you'll give them
20:10
glimpses of mansions in heaven or the
20:12
streets of gold or even the throne
20:15
sometimes so that is absolutely that
20:17
part's absolutely true i think because
20:20
their spiritual body is getting more
20:22
aware
20:23
and um
20:24
even when it gets close to them stepping
20:26
out and they literally step out of their
20:28
body that's what they do if they're
20:30
sitting up naturally they'll just step
20:32
right out of their the physical body
20:34
it'll fall back but there they are right
20:36
there looking at their own body that's
20:38
happened to a lot of people and then
20:39
jesus would say it's not your time so
20:41
they have to go back in
20:42
wow there are many different things that
20:44
could happen some people were here
20:46
heavenly choir saying that part is very
20:48
true
20:49
and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about
20:51
something else in a minute about the
20:53
choirs but that is true and yes uh even
20:57
sometimes when people are really sick
20:59
maybe they're not terminal they will see
21:01
glimpses of places in heaven and i
21:03
believe the atrium thing that they're
21:04
seeing is probably some beautiful part
21:06
of the gardens of heaven uh there's a
21:09
friendly forest in heaven they have
21:11
beautiful gardens surrounding that
21:13
there's a butterfly there's like this
21:15
beautiful meadow where butterflies are
21:18
uh they actually will sing you hear them
21:20
singing so they could hear a heaven part
21:23
of heaven singing they could see angels
21:24
i could see family members there
21:26
and that does bring peace to them and
21:28
sometimes not just peace some people get
21:30
really excited when they when they have
21:32
glimpses of heaven like that that's
21:34
amazing well that's it's encouraging
21:36
because as i said the number of times my
21:38
mom's real close i'm kind of curious by
21:40
the way regarding that now my mom's
21:43
memory is going we just got back from
21:44
ohio she's got now she doesn't remember
21:47
from conversation to conversation
21:50
a few minutes late does god
21:53
let me ask it this way does god have a
21:54
harder time getting a hold of someone
21:56
like that who needs a little bit more of
21:58
him or does he have an easier time
22:00
because she's
22:02
tuned out of life what would that be
22:04
like
22:05
for her to maybe
22:07
i think it wouldn't matter what state
22:09
they're in mentally emotionally or
22:11
physically
22:13
when he wants to make himself known or
22:15
let them begin many times if we're
22:17
saying they feel no matter where they
22:19
are on their path if they belong to him
22:21
it he already has that connection with
22:24
them in their spirit
22:26
when he's ready to show them something
22:27
he's going to do it but normally that
22:29
will begin to change that person and
22:31
even if they can't remember what they
22:32
ate the day before who visit them the
22:34
day before they normally will not forget
22:36
if they begin to have encounters and
22:39
sometimes it's not like a face-to-face
22:41
encounter sometimes it's his presence uh
22:44
sometimes they they may say oh i feel
22:46
really good right now i i feel amazing i
22:49
feel such peace on me that's usually
22:51
because christ could be in that room
22:54
with them right there in that moment i
22:56
just know that sometimes it might be a
22:57
little bit easier in my thinking if your
23:00
natural mind begins to shut down or your
23:02
memory system the reason for that is
23:05
they can't remember the things that they
23:06
were angry about they can't remember
23:08
things
23:09
you know they can't remember their cares
23:11
they can't remember their concerns they
23:12
don't remember any things that were said
23:14
to them or maybe things that they did
23:16
that they shouldn't have you know maybe
23:18
unkind words that's gone from them so
23:21
that does totally open it up for the
23:24
lord to begin to either speak to them or
23:25
begin to show them things so this that
23:27
might be a good thing well you know it's
23:29
interesting you would say that i wasn't
23:30
going to share this but you know my
23:32
life's an open book right now but you
23:34
know
23:36
what what's that
23:39
you love it it's so open because every
23:40
millions are white i know well we went
23:43
out in march and i i was thinking i was
23:45
being a good dutiful
23:47
obedient loving son to offer her to come
23:51
and live with us from ohio and boy oh
23:53
heck broke liz and i understand this is
23:56
this is really what happens to a lot of
23:58
seniors at this age they if you think
24:03
if they're thinking you're taking their
24:04
blasted i mean she didn't say any bad
24:06
words but she was furious he was
24:09
okay so now fast forward we just can't
24:11
went out there in ohio and we were
24:14
itching her along
24:15
and then she called me after we we got
24:18
back and and
24:20
she's now she's inviting herself to live
24:22
with me instead of the other
24:24
i said i said well mom
24:27
you
24:27
you know after you treated me so
24:30
horribly and she goes what are you
24:31
talking about and she made me repeat it
24:33
five times and she didn't even remember
24:35
after five seconds after i told her she
24:37
said now tell me again what i did then
24:39
we found out later she doesn't even
24:41
remember any of us flying out there
24:43
during march
24:44
yeah that does that actually doesn't
24:48
happen as part of the process of just
24:50
being prepared many times just to just
24:53
to leave
24:54
um but that's normal and you're right
24:56
that's very normal
24:58
and
24:59
even most people when they of course if
25:01
they're still around here around a
25:02
heaven uh a hundred years old you you
25:05
should see some of them some of them are
25:06
sharp as attack but in the natural most
25:09
people's bodies and their systems and
25:11
the way they operate their thinking it
25:14
kind of begins to shut down some uh they
25:16
may be alert in every other way but
25:19
their memory from like the day before
25:21
whatever like she was saying to you that
25:23
might be god's blessing sometimes
25:25
because like you said she didn't
25:26
remember even saying that yeah it feels
25:28
like well i had i had actually been
25:31
again here's that open book thing i was
25:33
really wounded i was hurt and i kind of
25:36
cared that i kept forgetting her in my
25:37
heart all this time after i found out
25:40
yesterday that she has no recollection
25:43
i'm thinking what
25:45
what how what purpose would it be to
25:47
even have any hurt left what have i
25:49
heard about something that she has no
25:51
recollection of ever doing so it's like
25:53
it just fell off it just fell off
26:00
it's almost like
26:01
maybe a child does something not to hurt
26:03
you on purpose but it just happens you
26:05
know
26:06
and uh especially in the different
26:08
growing years they might say something
26:09
hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and
26:12
it it it's part of their growing the
26:15
young on the young side but when they're
26:18
older it's just part of what's natural
26:21
and i think that is i know people who've
26:23
forgotten that went through traumas and
26:25
stuff not not my family of other people
26:27
had horrible traumas when they got
26:29
closer to that age they didn't even
26:30
remember it it's like it just naturally
26:33
left them and they're happy i've also
26:36
known people who like almost couldn't
26:37
stand being around somebody and now they
26:40
love them it's the same
26:42
same people but but they really love
26:44
them because the person who was holding
26:46
that was gone because the memory part
26:48
was gone
26:49
so yes steve you can't you can't hold it
26:51
against somebody who to them like well
26:52
that never happened i would never say
26:54
that
26:55
they mean to you i never said that
26:58
yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't
27:00
you know i was
27:03
you were hurting that hurt
27:07
so anyway that's good all right here we
27:09
go
27:10
he goes i'm i'm finding out that my
27:12
seven-year-old son
27:13
is a seer what is your number one piece
27:15
of advice for a young seer for their
27:17
parents his sister has an autoimmune
27:20
issue and he said that once while we
27:21
were praying for her healing he looked
27:24
up and saw a small angel about four
27:26
inches tall
27:27
with wings wearing a red dress with her
27:29
hand on my daughter's foot praying for
27:32
her would that have been her guardian
27:34
angel that my son saw or a different one
27:37
sent for specific purpose so it's kind
27:39
of a multi-part there that probably
27:41
would be a different one sent for a
27:43
specific purpose but since you brought
27:44
that whole thing up
27:46
i i have known families who had a child
27:49
who was handicapped in some way
27:52
they get extra angels assigned to them
27:54
just because of that what we would call
27:57
a disability uh they get extra ones
27:59
assigned to them
28:00
and this young man now is so almost
28:03
absolutely normal he has some physical
28:05
things not causing him pain but growing
28:07
up they said he wouldn't live they said
28:09
he would never have a normal mind he
28:11
would never be able to talk never feed
28:13
himself and this was being fed to this
28:15
young child's parents like their whole
28:17
life they refused to accept that they
28:19
made sure he had everybody the care that
28:21
he had but they talked to him normal
28:24
they didn't treat him like there's
28:25
something wrong with him and he has two
28:28
angels that are with him all the time
28:29
besides his guardian angel and they're
28:31
there because of this this handicap
28:34
thing he has like i said this is like 30
28:36
years later and you know to see him he's
28:39
so filled with the light of god he's a
28:40
believer
28:42
and he's such a testimony to people
28:44
because of how he has grown in every way
28:46
that the doctor said he wouldn't be
28:47
alive but there were two angels assigned
28:50
to him and i knew somebody else who had
28:53
someone who was grown and they also had
28:56
two other angels and finally i just
28:57
asked holy spirit why are those other
28:59
angels with him
29:01
they looked different than from their
29:02
guardian angels and they said oh they're
29:04
sent to they they like protect the
29:07
anointing that they carry they're there
29:09
just to be uh yeah to bring things down
29:11
from heaven to them that god wants to
29:13
put into them i'm pretty certain that's
29:16
what that four inch angel was that was
29:18
like a little messenger angel bringing
29:20
something down they wouldn't be part of
29:22
the host but they probably were brought
29:24
down from heaven with one of the hosts
29:25
probably brought them down there so that
29:28
was great as far as being a seer
29:30
i would get a journal most important to
29:33
write down things that he's seeing it's
29:35
really important that they do that
29:38
when he gets older he'll be very
29:39
grateful for that journal uh like right
29:41
the day what he said he saw just write
29:44
in his words what he said
29:46
and then anytime he comes i've already
29:48
told some of my
29:50
my daughters to make sure that they do
29:51
that and so one of them has actually
29:53
started cataloging and now this child is
29:56
10
29:57
and he's not stopped seeing things but
29:59
it's very powerful to him that he can
30:01
read about the things he said that he
30:03
heard said or that he saw so definitely
30:07
most important thing you can do is uh no
30:09
matter what god ends up by doing with
30:10
that gift he has
30:12
it will be very powerful one day make
30:14
sure you're writing it down yeah and
30:16
what
30:16
what's the deal with the four inch angel
30:20
versus a seven foot angel i mean
30:22
what would you say about that
30:24
i would say
30:25
possibly whatever it is that the child
30:28
is um whatever it was you said that they
30:30
had it probably there may be like a
30:33
tribe of those little angels like that
30:35
made for that specific thing
30:38
that they were diagnosed with and that
30:40
maybe that may be something that god
30:42
sends maybe his life is in them they're
30:44
they're probably putting the life of god
30:46
in them oh the peace of god in them so
30:49
that would be their only assignment that
30:51
would be what they would be sent for
30:52
probably to keep that child in peace or
30:55
the presence of god yeah i guess the
30:57
issue was it was she just said it was an
30:58
autoimmune issue so she didn't say that
31:01
so
31:01
okay melanie asked how old does god look
31:05
how old would we perceive him to be in
31:07
earthly terms i've heard you describe
31:09
kind of seeing his face but i've also
31:11
heard you describe
31:12
almost a little bit of a veil so i mean
31:14
how do you see him you and i talked on
31:16
the cruise that one time and i said are
31:19
you telling me
31:21
cat that you're sitting down
31:23
sitting down talking face to face with
31:25
the god of the whole cosmos
31:28
and you just like yeah
31:32
you know
31:32
that should be crazy
31:34
it would be like
31:36
asking that question to a child
31:38
that really saw something let's say your
31:40
child went and saw somebody or met
31:42
somebody and you maybe try to convince
31:44
them i don't think you saw them they
31:45
would be so adamant
31:47
uh that the child like part of me
31:50
there's nothing in me that could make up
31:52
anything he wouldn't use me at all if he
31:54
if if i did that i i'm a detailed person
31:57
so i'm always going to see details one
32:00
of the reasons why i see him clearly is
32:02
he chose me because i have a
32:05
photographic memory and i am a detailed
32:07
person like i'm not going to hear just a
32:09
sentence that he says i i'm taking
32:12
places that i have to remember all that
32:14
i saw
32:15
and then they have to write that down if
32:16
it's things that god came and told me
32:18
personally and he said i want you to i
32:21
want you to share this with people then
32:22
i have to remember exactly what he said
32:25
it's not like it becomes um familiar in
32:28
any way i won't even use that term
32:30
because the power uh the power he
32:33
carries i'm sure he has to probably uh
32:36
maybe minimize that a little bit just
32:38
for me to be able to be around him i
32:40
probably i sometimes i feel like
32:42
when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's
32:43
just to be in his presence i feel like
32:45
i'm going to melt and go inside of him i
32:47
don't know how to yeah outs to explain
32:49
that the love that comes from him is so
32:52
powerful and it's it's not just what i
32:55
feel his appearance is
32:57
quite striking if i could say that
33:01
you feel life
33:02
coming from him because it did we all
33:05
lived there so it's like he's holding
33:07
everything in him all of time is in him
33:09
he didn't appear somewhere time came
33:11
from him
33:12
and i know i i love the one-liners he
33:14
tells me to tell people they get their
33:16
heads so undone they try to wrap their
33:18
head around it but most of these things
33:19
are spiritually um discerned
33:22
i would say in his normal appearance
33:25
because i've seen him like a certain way
33:27
many times then there's times i've seen
33:29
him with flames of fire with lightning
33:31
bolts shooting out of him when he's
33:33
walking against the darkness and stuff
33:35
like that his own appearance begins to
33:37
change it talks about the wrath of god
33:41
and any believer you should know this
33:43
that we are not appointed under that
33:45
wrath that he was demonstrating that
33:46
would be evil in darkness and wickedness
33:50
that he despises evil he despise what it
33:53
does to people so if he was gonna catch
33:55
me up there and talk about the justice
33:58
that is coming then his whole appearance
34:00
would be to bring justice that would
34:03
show me that that fierce side of him
34:05
okay
34:06
the loving father side of him which is
34:08
what i see many times
34:10
i know his hair is made out of light
34:12
remember the father is all spiritual but
34:15
he still has the ability to hold me if
34:17
he wants to
34:19
or i can just stand next to him i can
34:22
see into his eyes and usually they're
34:23
like blue flames of fire they're they
34:26
look blue to me blue flames of fire but
34:28
what comes out of him if you could
34:30
picture
34:31
um
34:32
i love the northern lights i've not seen
34:34
them in person but i've seen god
34:37
and that's what that rainbow looks like
34:38
coming out of him if you ever wondered
34:40
it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not
34:42
like you could just paint it around him
34:45
and it would just be there and not have
34:46
life and movement and i would have to
34:48
say seeing the northern lights in the
34:50
way that they move like this coming out
34:53
of him continually and on these
34:56
waves of his rainbow which he it comes
34:59
from him no man made the rainbow people
35:02
it comes from the living god it's part
35:03
of his own appearance and his person and
35:06
out of that comes these little spirits
35:08
of life they'll ride on this rainbow
35:09
then ride back in him that's what you
35:11
used to do when you lived inside god it
35:14
says in him we live we move we have our
35:18
very being the prophets and poets of old
35:20
have spoken of these things what things
35:22
when they were shown that
35:25
way in the past god would show himself
35:26
to people sometimes and sometimes it was
35:29
someone who was a poet and they actually
35:30
wrote poems about that
35:32
and so one of those made it in the word
35:34
of god so that's just a part of him to
35:37
see him like that the creative side
35:40
where i would see jesus step out of the
35:42
father and the father would say
35:44
something and then he would make what he
35:47
said that's why he was called the word
35:50
we know in the book of john it says that
35:53
we know in the book of john when john
35:54
said
35:56
the word was with god
35:59
and was god and there was nothing that
36:01
was made that was not made by him
36:04
that was jesus christ that's who he the
36:07
word came to the earth and died uh as
36:10
the son of god and so they're one and
36:13
the same the word jesus christ are the
36:15
same but when he was the word he only
36:17
had a spiritual body he was all spirit
36:20
it was still a body i know in your mind
36:22
you can't imagine you think of something
36:24
like a little like a spirit like
36:26
whatever you want to call it like the
36:28
spirit of a person or something they're
36:30
much more there's much more to them than
36:32
just some little wispy thing if you're
36:35
in a spirit world which heaven is and
36:38
everyone there in the spiritual body
36:40
they look solid in that world okay so
36:43
when i see the father most of the time
36:45
he looks like he's solid although he's
36:47
all spirit so i've seen him with love
36:50
coming out that consumes like the whole
36:52
army of god before they're going to go
36:54
somewhere um to bring justice for him
36:57
over someone on the earth he'll
36:59
literally go and just stand in their
37:00
midst and every one of them will be
37:03
permeated with his love he loves them
37:05
too
37:06
and his love and and just empowerment
37:09
and and when you see that he's he is
37:12
kind
37:13
and he is good and many people don't see
37:16
the father is good but jesus himself
37:18
said there's none good but the father
37:21
and so when you see there's many
37:23
different parts of him sides of him
37:25
uh that's who he is but
37:27
i i'm always undone
37:30
when he comes most of the time
37:32
unannounced
37:33
because what is on his heart to share
37:35
i'm i'm his revelator that's what he
37:37
calls me that means i reveal for him
37:41
i don't reveal for a man so i'm not
37:43
gonna usually i can answer questions ask
37:45
me if i've been told or shown it
37:47
otherwise i can't answer that i can't
37:49
answer for him if i haven't been shown
37:51
or told something
37:54
so it's really quite undone sometimes
37:56
the room i'm in like where i sleep which
37:59
is in my office built this moment
38:01
there's a huge portal in that room and
38:04
and sometimes he would come down through
38:06
that portal but sometimes most likely in
38:08
the hotel room a lot of times he'll just
38:10
walk through the wall like it's not
38:12
there and he'll begin to tell me stuff
38:14
sometimes he'll tell me to write it down
38:16
sometimes he'll write on the wall
38:18
and we know that even in the word of god
38:20
it talks about him doing these things so
38:22
for him
38:23
those are normal things he does when he
38:25
when he knows somebody who's going to
38:27
tell the truth who will not embellish on
38:29
what he
38:31
what he said which is extremely
38:33
significant even john the baptist had
38:36
one of the greatest revelations ever
38:37
given on the earth that's why they said
38:39
he's the greatest prophet of all that's
38:41
why that's in there he announced
38:43
literally
38:44
here is the son of god he actually got
38:47
to say that even though in the natural
38:48
he was jesus's cousin when he spoke
38:51
those words he wasn't speaking from a
38:53
natural viewpoint he was speaking from a
38:55
divine point and he never changed as
38:57
much as that he came that he came to say
39:00
that you had to repent of your sins
39:01
right he was one of the first ones to
39:03
give that message so what he said was so
39:06
powerful when he actually said here he
39:08
is
39:09
uh the the first and only person on the
39:11
earth who could actually say here's
39:13
jesus christ the son of the living god
39:15
this is the messiah that was a powerful
39:17
word but he never changed what he said
39:19
because that's what god told him to say
39:22
wow yeah and you've always been obedient
39:24
that way you know almost to a
39:26
frustrating point because people will
39:27
ask you something i've seen it even on
39:29
um
39:30
what's the kenneth copeland channel i
39:32
can't think of any victory channel or
39:33
whatever and flashpoint and they'll try
39:35
to get you to answer a question you'll
39:37
say i can only tell you what god told me
39:39
and then he'll launch into your
39:41
prophecy that was that's pretty i've
39:43
learned learned a good way um also
39:45
that's part of that same question is
39:47
does god the father does he look like a
39:50
grandpa does he look like a dad who's
39:52
older what what age
39:54
impression when he leaves well i know
39:56
you're wanting most people will judge
39:58
somebody by their skin
39:59
okay or conditioning is a skin and does
40:01
it have wrinkles does it not have
40:03
wrinkles does it have like brown spots
40:07
and most people judge people nor in the
40:10
natural you know um if they have white
40:12
hair no hair
40:14
i mean i i can't answer him in that
40:17
context i cannot put him in a category
40:20
as a human i know that i see life in him
40:23
i see still even now talking you can
40:26
still see his face
40:28
very clearly and it's filled with life
40:31
there's no age in him he's never going
40:34
to age his hair is white it's alive his
40:38
hair on his head is living it's not
40:40
short hair it's down below his shoulders
40:43
uh he has this amazing uh wonderful
40:46
beard
40:47
um
40:48
it just you know i can't i tell people
40:50
say what do you think he looks like
40:51
kenny rogers he doesn't look like a
40:53
human
40:56
everyone fails in comparison to him
40:59
because of the stuff he carries that
41:02
makes him who he is
41:04
but i can just say that you will you'll
41:06
never regret giving yourself to his son
41:09
that is the one where you are assured of
41:11
meeting him in person
41:13
he's excited about seeing you he cannot
41:15
wait for you to get back home to heaven
41:18
and i hope this gives you a glimpse of
41:20
the other side of dying for you you're
41:22
losing something for him he's gaining
41:24
something he's gaining his son or his
41:27
daughter back to himself he is so
41:30
excited all of heaven celebrates when
41:32
they come home so for them there's
41:35
there's there's no loss in their mind uh
41:38
from the time they step out of the
41:39
spiritual body they're stepping right
41:41
there they feel his presence they see
41:43
their angels their excitement floods
41:46
them you know i mean it's not like they
41:48
don't love you to actually love you even
41:49
more
41:50
but but just to be in his presence i
41:53
understand why jesus when he had to live
41:55
on the earth he'd go away to the
41:56
mountains to to be with his father he
41:58
would go away to go be that he needed it
42:00
after living here with humans are you
42:02
kidding
42:03
and so king himself
42:05
loves the father and i think for him the
42:08
greatest thing he gets to do is take us
42:10
back to him when you come home to heaven
42:12
he walks you up the steps of god's
42:15
throne the father's throne and gives you
42:18
back to him he says
42:20
your son your daughter they've come home
42:22
and let me tell you the celebration will
42:24
start in heaven at that time but but he
42:27
is not little he's not a little person
42:29
in any way whatsoever but this is what i
42:32
love about the father one of the
42:33
greatest things i like to say about him
42:35
is he could be a hundred feet tall two
42:37
thousand feet tall whatever he wants to
42:39
be he can be that size i think sitting
42:42
on the throne many times and to me he
42:44
would look like maybe i don't know 10 15
42:46
feet high he he doesn't want to make
42:48
himself invisible to you if you're
42:50
coming home to meet him but i've seen
42:52
him holding the earth in his hands so i
42:54
hope you get this picture i've seen him
42:57
back in time when he was making the
42:59
earth holding it in his hand this is the
43:02
father when the word would step out he'd
43:05
make it gave it to the father the father
43:07
began to speak over the earth itself
43:10
he would pour water from himself he's
43:12
going to put the water on the earth he
43:14
poured from his own south the river of
43:16
the river of life that comes from him he
43:19
poured that in as the ocean on the earth
43:23
and so whatever they did they did
43:24
together and so i've seen him that big
43:27
to hold the earth in his hand
43:32
i've seen him be you know make himself
43:36
well call enormous eyes just to hold you
43:38
he'll stand up on the throne and hold
43:39
you to himself
43:41
and i also know this about him that even
43:44
though he's on the throne
43:46
he himself can make himself
43:49
not leaving the throne
43:51
small enough to step inside of himself
43:54
to play with all the little spirits of
43:56
life that's who you were are you serious
43:59
with you in himself while he's sitting
44:02
on the throne people he knows what's
44:04
going on
44:06
if you think he's willing to give this
44:09
earth that he loved that he spoke over
44:12
to evil what do you think he didn't have
44:14
and he kicked it out it got unseated
44:18
lost his place lost his authority lost
44:21
his power
44:22
lucifer did you think he's changed his
44:25
mind about that because he has not
44:28
he loves you too much and this time is
44:32
too important for him to give it over to
44:34
evil all i know is they're going to lay
44:36
down roll over and beg god for mercy
44:40
when those days of justice fall upon
44:42
them and for some of them it will be too
44:45
late
44:47
wow wow catboy the anointing hit you
44:49
right there god came
44:51
god came down wow
44:53
wildcat
44:54
cat let me can i explore a little bit
44:56
you talk about the son loves the fat
44:58
father loves his son and son loves the
44:59
father i think we've talked about this a
45:01
little bit let me
45:03
drill down you know when i was raised up
45:04
we'd always make sure we pray in the
45:06
name of jesus make sure you say the name
45:08
of jesus and it became like a
45:10
a formulaic word make sure you mention
45:13
the name of jesus because then god can
45:15
has to do it but but is there something
45:18
in when we pray in the name of jesus
45:21
that we should at that moment
45:24
almost tap into how much the father
45:26
loves jesus
45:28
as we're saying that as opposed to just
45:30
making sure you pronounce jesus or
45:33
yeshua what
45:35
what is that go ahead and understand who
45:38
you're talking about when you use this
45:40
name
45:41
uh and if if there's probably if you're
45:44
saying it just from head knowledge this
45:46
is what you want to know don't ever say
45:48
his name from head knowledge
45:50
okay you need to say it from revelation
45:54
like what i just spoke okay that's how
45:57
you should feel every time you say his
45:59
name for any purpose you're having power
46:03
in that name of jesus that's why it is
46:05
one of your greatest weapons the name of
46:07
the name of christ okay his name his
46:10
blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of
46:14
who he is he right now he right now is
46:17
the king of glory people uh he has many
46:21
other titles besides jesus christ when
46:24
you talk about him as your savior and
46:26
what he did for you he also gave you
46:28
power over all the power of the enemy he
46:33
gave us three things you see him from
46:34
that viewpoint it should almost be like
46:38
a threat to hell that you are saying the
46:41
name of jesus christ
46:43
wow wow
46:45
yeah that's a whole lot different
46:47
well that's what the lord's been showing
46:48
me lately is is to tap into to that to
46:53
him to the reality
46:54
um
46:56
yeah and this one you kind of answered
46:58
this this is the next question but you
46:59
kind of addressed this
47:01
it says before jesus came to the earth
47:02
and he was called the word in heaven did
47:05
his spiritual body then look like
47:08
what we know as his human body or what
47:10
we think of as his human body or was his
47:12
body more like i don't know what i don't
47:14
know what this means was his body more
47:16
like the holy spirit i i think this
47:18
person's grasping between um
47:22
a cloud like the holy spirit or the body
47:24
of jesus but i i think they both have
47:27
um
47:28
a
47:29
spiritual butt right
47:32
yeah i would say when you are you
47:34
talking about let me get the timing
47:36
right are they talking about what jesus
47:37
looked like when he stepped out of his
47:39
physical body let me see when jesus came
47:41
to the earth and he was called the word
47:44
in heaven he was called the word did his
47:46
spiritual body then in heaven
47:50
look the same as his human body looked
47:52
on earth
47:54
oh when he was the word did it look the
47:56
same as the physical body on earth that
47:59
seemed to be the question no physical
48:00
body changed him from what he looked
48:03
like
48:05
because if it looked just like the word
48:07
why did not satan recognize him oh good
48:11
point oh good point he did not know when
48:14
he took him to the mountain temptation
48:15
that was the son of the living god he
48:18
didn't know that he was trying to find
48:19
out who he was
48:22
he was always pursuing who is he until
48:25
he himself said who he was he did not
48:28
know
48:29
he did not know he was the word that was
48:31
with god the word was all spiritual body
48:34
that was his divine body a spiritual
48:37
body a spiritual body like we were just
48:39
talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know
48:41
what they're talking about you're
48:43
talking about what they've seen on tv or
48:44
movies this little wispy thing steps out
48:46
they can go through walls and the reason
48:48
why uh your spiritual body down here
48:50
could walk through a wall is that
48:52
physical wall is a temporary substance
48:56
it's even a temporary realm the physical
48:59
realm is not the original realm the
49:01
spiritual realm where the whole world
49:03
called heaven was created where tribes
49:06
of angels were made where you go back
49:08
home to live in that place you don't
49:10
pass to the walls in heaven and your
49:12
spiritual body okay you have substance
49:15
in your spiritual body but as far as the
49:18
appearance thing the word was very
49:20
powerful he could go in and out wherever
49:23
he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he
49:25
had no flesh attached to him the other
49:28
sacrifice you don't realize he made was
49:31
he was willing not just to walk and live
49:34
in a physical body he had to keep the
49:36
physical body wow and so when your
49:39
little spirit person leaves god when you
49:42
lived in god you didn't look like
49:44
this okay you had a little appearance
49:47
you had a face you little face you had
49:48
body you could play inside of god and
49:50
the river of life climbed the mountain
49:51
that's in him a ride in and out on the
49:54
waves of the rainbow you could do those
49:56
things in your little spiritual body but
49:59
you didn't look
50:00
this gave you an identity okay that's
50:03
one of the reasons why he wanted you to
50:05
have a fleshly body number one so you
50:07
could live in this physical body in this
50:10
physical world and do things for him
50:12
here
50:13
but as opposed to the word the word look
50:16
different than jesus christ did because
50:19
the flesh wrapped around your spiritual
50:21
body
50:22
your spiritual body actually adapts to
50:26
the flesh
50:27
because when your throat man steps out
50:29
of this body when mine does
50:32
it looks the same as if i was in my
50:34
fleshly body except
50:37
i look a whole lot younger and so were
50:40
you one day so know that satan did not
50:43
recognize
50:45
who jesus christ was he didn't know he
50:47
was the word okay who made him actually
50:51
uh satan was created he's a created
50:53
being
50:54
he didn't know that that was the word he
50:56
didn't know at all
50:58
and that that was part of the bushwhack
51:00
people so that was part of the butch
51:02
whack that jesus would almost have a
51:04
disguise that satan wouldn't recognize
51:07
for a very long time jesus could do
51:09
things he wanted to say what he wanted
51:11
to and
51:12
and satan i'm sure was quite shocked
51:15
when jesus christ you know
51:17
living on the earth began to cast demons
51:20
out of things that really freaked him
51:21
out i'm really sure
51:23
now he said okay this person's got power
51:25
he's got power i i don't didn't know he
51:27
had this power uh
51:30
and he's not really as brilliant as he
51:32
wants people to think he is because when
51:34
he got kicked out the heaven part of his
51:35
mind was seared by that lightning bolt
51:38
i'm just letting you know so he did not
51:40
know that that jesus christ was the word
51:43
of god because jesus himself with his
51:46
fleshly body looked different than the
51:49
word and right now he still looks like
51:51
jesus christ who lived and walked on the
51:53
earth except for this
51:55
he has his glorified body already he was
51:58
glorified that body was glorified when
52:00
he stepped up from hell came up from
52:02
hell and stepped into that physical body
52:04
that was dead laying on that slab
52:07
life infused it but not just life but
52:09
the glory of god infused the body of
52:12
jesus christ and he walks around now in
52:13
his physical glorified body
52:16
in heaven so when he comes to see me
52:18
that's that's who i see is the one in
52:20
the glorified body and you know when you
52:22
said uh this is the first time it ever
52:24
clicked that we would have looked
52:26
different inside the father because we
52:28
would only look like we looked down
52:30
because i'm a combination of my mother
52:32
and my father that's
52:34
the appearance i took on
52:36
that's right because i had a natural
52:38
mother father so i don't look totally
52:40
different in heaven before god selected
52:42
the family for me i guess yes
52:45
he knew all along
52:47
he knew you would be looking like just
52:49
like you do now steve
52:51
he knew everybody would be looking like
52:52
that like they do right now in their
52:54
physical body he knew
52:56
when you were in him you were chosen
52:59
at that point for some things in your
53:01
life he put a little mark on you he knew
53:04
i would be a prophet he knew you would
53:06
make a home for the prophets to come and
53:08
say whatever god wanted to say he knew
53:10
that we probably knew each other we
53:12
probably were friends inside of him that
53:14
would be cool to know that would be
53:16
really interesting you think so we
53:18
wouldn't
53:18
be doing so because
53:20
i know
53:21
those who were friends inside of god if
53:23
he chose you to be a part of your
53:25
lifetime
53:27
uh in a significant way he would
53:30
absolutely choose people that kids that
53:32
you were like call them kids they all
53:34
little they're all little at all like a
53:36
bunch of little kids living in him and
53:38
and you had i would see little kids
53:40
sometimes with little groups playing
53:42
with each other and doing things with
53:43
each other and we we can have a whole
53:46
whole just segment about life and god uh
53:49
really that would be quite fascinating
53:51
to find out revelation about what did
53:53
you do in there what went on there what
53:54
does it look like and there's another
53:56
whole thing
53:57
but i'm pretty sure that we probably
53:59
were friends i know my husband and i
54:02
were friends when we were we were part
54:04
of this the little group that we had
54:06
uh inside god that we played there's
54:08
millions inside of him but
54:10
there's no back to god there's no size
54:13
to god it's like inside of him he's part
54:16
of infinity
54:17
and that at one time you know before he
54:19
made the earth we all everyone who ever
54:21
was or will be lived in him you can
54:24
imagine in your head let's hope you
54:26
maybe that makes you realize how
54:27
powerful he is about who he is uh he is
54:30
limitless in his understanding and his
54:32
knowledge and in his revelation he's
54:35
unlimited in almost every way he's
54:37
unlimited can i ask you a a difficult
54:41
question
54:42
that some watching will even um
54:45
it would be their question it would be
54:47
their question
54:49
god knew you before you were born he
54:51
knew what you would look like before you
54:52
were born and then there are people who
54:55
are product of of either
54:58
born out of wedlock in some cases rape
55:01
how do you what do you say to people who
55:03
say but what about me how could god have
55:05
known me
55:07
and allowed me to either have
55:10
children of abuse or
55:12
what do you say about the plan of god
55:14
and what
55:15
sometimes we're allowed to go through
55:17
in this life
55:19
i think one day
55:21
when you get your book given to you that
55:23
was written about you in heaven you'll
55:24
understand that he didn't choose any of
55:27
the evil stuff at all that wasn't had
55:29
nothing to do with god at all he sent us
55:31
to this earth it's an imperfect earth
55:33
there's imperfect people
55:35
everybody is held accountable for what
55:37
they did they they there there will be
55:39
an accountability uh of course when you
55:42
receive jesus christ that has something
55:44
to do with wiping that away
55:46
but i can tell you this he sent you this
55:48
is what happened he picked you for
55:50
certain things he sent you to earth at
55:53
the time he needed you to be here
55:56
he didn't choose those people to be
55:58
wicked they weren't always wicked when
55:59
they were children they weren't wicked
56:01
okay so everybody making their own
56:03
choices are raising their children
56:06
in a certain way because of what's in
56:08
them
56:09
and that's why i always i talk to young
56:11
people a lot i've done young people
56:13
meetings and i say you have to
56:14
understand that you're not just going to
56:17
be raising children one day you are
56:19
shaping souls
56:21
that came from god for his use do not be
56:24
abusive i'm i'm telling them this
56:26
already but you know what that's if they
56:28
watch a lot of violent stuff
56:30
just go into their soul and even
56:32
psychiatrists know this they don't
56:34
understand the workings of the soul or
56:36
what the soul looks like but what you
56:38
what you choose what you listen to all
56:41
the time will become a part of you what
56:43
you watch all the time would become a
56:44
part of me and eventually you might even
56:46
act out some of those things you see
56:49
and that's why there's evil satan helps
56:51
that to happen he makes sure it happen
56:54
happens and yet there's some people who
56:56
grew up in a violent household
56:59
that that never part part took of that
57:01
they they were strong they never allowed
57:03
that to affect their life or how they
57:06
lived it later and became and were
57:08
totally totally different people than
57:10
what that person was that had them so
57:12
you have to understand god didn't create
57:15
he didn't make evil happen
57:17
he didn't even make lucifer satan
57:20
if you go back that far let's go that
57:22
far he may lucifer to be an anointed
57:25
being who would help lead worship
57:27
for him to create glory for him to be a
57:30
light for him that's what that's what
57:33
lucifer's job was he made him for that
57:36
he didn't make him to be evil it says in
57:38
the bible iniquity was found in him
57:42
that was significantly because god
57:44
didn't put that in him
57:46
okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's
57:49
own thoughts and own
57:50
wicked desires to be greater than god
57:53
and want to rule
57:55
from that came evil began to be birthed
57:58
inside of him before it came out so
58:00
because there is evil
58:03
present in this world one day there
58:05
won't be any
58:07
we can look at it that way but god
58:09
didn't choose you to be tormented he
58:12
didn't choose that those people who
58:15
raised you had every right to choose to
58:17
do what was right regardless of what
58:19
within them they had every right to be
58:22
kind to you to nourish you
58:24
to nurture you and everything and know
58:26
god and no happiness and joy
58:29
and not have your mind tormented later
58:31
in your life all the things that
58:32
happened to you as a child but god
58:33
didn't create evil
58:35
in this earth
58:37
he didn't know evil would be here but he
58:40
also sent his son for the very purpose
58:42
that you could be free from anything
58:44
you went through you can be free from
58:46
any event no matter how bad it was or
58:48
when it happened you don't have to carry
58:50
that stuff on the inside of you
58:52
and that's why he came to bring freedom
58:54
in life he had an appointed time to be
58:57
here even jesus christ had to be made
59:00
into a seed this is what it says christ
59:03
was made into a seed he was made okay he
59:06
had he was going to have flesh on him
59:08
and i think on my our next um report we
59:11
do i'll actually read the poem holy
59:13
spirit gave me
59:14
about when the announcements began to
59:16
made it be made in heaven that the word
59:18
would die for us that the word would be
59:20
made flesh which it says in the bible
59:24
he was planted as a seed in the womb of
59:26
mary but there's this whole beautiful
59:28
story
59:29
it's called the year before christmas
59:32
and what literally began to happen in
59:34
heaven um you know before he was even
59:36
sent
59:37
and i'm not going to do that today but
59:39
we'll do that next week but you have to
59:41
understand god has been from the
59:42
beginning to the end and no matter what
59:44
you thought you could do that would be
59:46
better
59:48
he
59:49
has a plan
59:51
he was willing to sacrifice his own son
59:53
who was tormented and tortured and so
59:56
horribly abused wrongfully accused uh
59:59
you know unjustly treated
60:02
and and basically murdered
60:05
he knew that
60:06
his son would go through that but what
60:08
comes from that and this is the thing
60:11
you even though it's not god's intention
60:13
to make you suffer for him his son
60:16
suffered for all of us
60:18
you can take your life no matter what
60:20
you've been through and you can lose all
60:21
of that all of that horror all of that
60:23
abuse all that torment all that trauma
60:26
lucifer from your soul in jesus name and
60:28
jesus will come pull it out of you
60:30
and it will be like it didn't happen in
60:33
other words you might think about it but
60:34
there'll be no torment in it there'll be
60:36
no suffering in it
60:38
because we can be totally free
60:41
from all of the effects of evil but god
60:43
didn't make people bad he didn't make
60:46
evil itself
60:48
and the evil one who's done this will be
60:51
more tormented than anything that ever
60:53
existed throughout all the time he satan
60:57
will be more tormented than any other
60:59
anyone else who ends up in that lake of
61:01
fire
61:02
satan will be the most hated being in
61:04
there the most tormented and he will
61:06
have no
61:08
power whatsoever so you can think of
61:11
it's one thing you to be in a place of
61:14
torment but when you everyone is
61:16
tormenting that one person and they
61:17
can't escape or get away uh that is his
61:20
end he will have nothing from anything
61:23
he's done god also knows that he's a
61:26
just god
61:27
and kind loving god so you need to see
61:30
him the kind loving one who gave the
61:32
greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying
61:35
to cover up things that were done to you
61:37
my parents didn't torment me uh but i
61:40
certainly was picked on and and made fun
61:42
of most of my life growing up and i just
61:45
had to let it go i don't even know about
61:46
losing you know i decided i'm going to
61:47
let it go and go on i have stuff i have
61:50
to do and i want to see done
61:54
you have to make the same decision but
61:55
let me tell you god does know everything
61:58
and he is not it is seedtime and harvest
62:01
people this is not
62:03
don't get your 50 bottles of anointing
62:05
oil out okay because this is not the end
62:08
time harvest it talks about in the bible
62:10
before all the other stuff start to
62:12
happen we're not even ready to handle
62:14
that harvest like that okay you're going
62:16
to be powerful you're going to be filled
62:18
with god when those days come but it's a
62:21
seedtime and harvest for what you've
62:23
been planting what the left has been
62:25
planting harvest for them is about to
62:28
happen what you've been planting by
62:30
yours making a stand still filled with
62:33
life encouraging people bringing people
62:35
hope you're going to get the greatest
62:36
harvest you've seen in your life so far
62:39
this is the seedtime and harvest is
62:40
happening now just that's for free what
62:43
time is it time and harvest for us
62:46
individually for whole groups of people
62:48
if it's evil you're going to get a
62:50
harvest of justice and and probably the
62:53
rather that and
62:54
while
62:55
while you're talking
62:57
as this as we close out i know i feel
62:59
like there's some people out there that
63:00
says i wish someone would just show me
63:03
right now how to get saved i i like this
63:06
stuff
63:07
no one's ever led me to the lord how do
63:09
i do that would you
63:11
i sure would love to do that yeah
63:14
and and let me tell you it's really
63:16
uh man can come
63:18
complicate things so much sometimes we
63:21
feel like we don't read you know the the
63:23
50-page syllabus
63:25
or if we don't have someone who's like
63:27
known god forever lead you even a child
63:30
can lead someone to be born again you
63:32
make a decision in your own self that
63:35
you want jesus christ okay
63:37
you're tired of what you've been living
63:39
in you're tired of the junk going on in
63:40
this world you see no hope if you don't
63:43
have hope right now
63:44
you may not have a lot of god in you
63:47
because right now he's releasing hope in
63:49
life when you are born again
63:52
literally your your soul gets a shower
63:55
of the blood of jesus christ to wipe
63:57
away every sin you've ever committed no
64:00
matter what it is when it happened in
64:03
your life if you want to walk as
64:05
righteous if you don't have jesus christ
64:07
you're unrighteous okay you're not
64:08
counted as righteous if you want to be
64:10
counted as righteous you're going to be
64:12
part of god's plan what he has in this
64:14
earth you need to know his son jesus
64:16
christ
64:17
you first of all recognize that jesus
64:19
christ is the son of the living god he
64:22
did die for your sins and he did it
64:24
purposefully he chose to do that so the
64:27
first thing you do is repent of any sin
64:29
you've ever committed no matter when it
64:31
happened or how that happened re repent
64:34
recognize that you are a sinner and you
64:36
repent and you receive jesus christ as
64:38
your savior that's the first step that
64:41
you do that the second step is you thank
64:44
him for dying for you thank him for your
64:46
sins being forgiven and it will be like
64:50
in god's books in heaven when you
64:52
receive christ he literally will go and
64:54
wipe out in his books every sin up to
64:58
that point every one you've ever
64:59
committed will be wiped off like you
65:01
never did them that's how powerful the
65:04
blood of christ is
65:06
then you say i receive everything that
65:08
that blood affords me i receive
65:09
everything that that sacrifice that
65:12
affords me i realize now i'm part of
65:14
god's family i'm a part of his family
65:17
i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free
65:20
by grace you are a powerful born again
65:24
uh believer now jesus christ will
65:26
literally step inside of you that's what
65:28
happens he'll step inside of you
65:31
it says you invite him to live in you
65:33
and he will and then you begin to feel
65:36
his presence
65:38
miraculous things will begin to happen
65:39
because now you're carrying his presence
65:42
with you and anytime temptation comes to
65:44
you after that make sure you say no i'm
65:46
not that person anymore it says you're
65:49
born again you are a new creation and
65:52
the reason why god can say that is none
65:54
of your past sins you're not being
65:56
looked at anymore by a sinful person
65:59
you're being looked at as god's son or
66:01
his daughter whichever one he made you
66:04
and now he opens doors for you to
66:07
understand him more make sure you get a
66:08
bible i would encourage you to start
66:11
reading the new testament read the book
66:12
of john and make sure you study the book
66:14
of john as a lot about who jesus was
66:17
also talks about what what it's like to
66:19
be born again and in in there it's real
66:22
exciting and then make sure you speak to
66:24
him you need to know that prayer is very
66:27
important for you you don't just get you
66:28
know born again and now i'm saved and
66:31
live your life like he always lived it
66:33
i'm not saying you can't stay at the
66:34
same job or live in the same home you'll
66:36
have the same family but you need to
66:38
recognize now you're a new creation made
66:41
by god because of the blood of christ
66:43
you begin to seek him and what does that
66:45
mean get in a room by yourself and say
66:47
jesus christ i want to know you more i
66:49
want i want to know you i want to know
66:51
what your heart is i want to know what
66:53
your thoughts are of me and i would say
66:55
i i used to do it at one point every day
66:57
of my life i did that usually late at
66:59
night i'm not saying you have to do
67:00
anything late at night and this is the
67:02
thing some people say you have to take a
67:04
certain posture it's okay if you want to
67:06
kneel to do it you can be walking down
67:08
the street and get born again you can
67:10
get born again arriving in your car he's
67:12
looking to know you more he is seeking
67:15
you harder than you are seeking him
67:19
so the most important thing in your life
67:21
should be to receive christ and then
67:23
begin to pursue to know him more and
67:26
then you start on a whole different
67:29
journey
67:30
in your life the inside of you has
67:32
changed your spirit man god puts light
67:34
in your spirit your spirit man has light
67:37
in it it gives it more understanding it
67:39
gives you more of his presence inside of
67:41
you
67:42
your name is literally written in the
67:44
lamb's book of life he'll write it right
67:46
there at that moment that you get born
67:48
again and so powerful things happen in
67:50
the spirit when you are born again so i
67:53
would just say just you can say a simple
67:54
prayer so let's just say this you can
67:56
say
67:57
jesus christ
67:59
jesus christ
68:01
i want to receive you as my savior i
68:04
want to receive you as my savior
68:06
i recognize
68:08
we recognize
68:10
you are the son of the living god you
68:13
are the son of the living god
68:15
you came to this world to die for my
68:18
sins you came to this world to die for
68:20
my sins
68:21
so i repent of all sin so i repent of
68:24
all sin
68:26
up to this moment in my life up to this
68:28
moment in my life
68:30
i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to
68:33
wash me clean
68:35
with your blood with your blood
68:38
i receive your sacrifice i receive your
68:41
sacrifice
68:43
and i now thank you and i now thank you
68:46
for making me part of the family of god
68:49
for making me part of the family of god
68:52
i give you permission i give you
68:54

03:14
hearing all about christmas town um but
03:17
before we start do you have any current
03:19
events that you want to share with us
03:22
i just want to say some of the greatest
03:24
things ever about to happen people
03:27
um you know i can share but not share
03:29
all of it i just know that things are
03:31
rumbling
03:32
in the undergrounds not just the
03:34
earthquakes but uh behind the scenes and
03:38
then covert places the solicitor's
03:40
covert
03:42
i can just tell you the new norm will be
03:44
better than what it was before people
03:46
it's not gonna we're not gonna be
03:47
controlled it's not gonna be a time of
03:49
sorrows we are not entering into the
03:52
perilous times we have way too much
03:54
stuff to do in this earth for jesus
03:55
christ and of course you know this show
03:58
highlights him also but it highlights
04:01
one of his best friends in heaven his
04:02
name would be nicholas so that's about
04:05
it let's just get going with those
04:06
questions
04:07
yes awesome so the first the first thing
04:11
i want you to just tell like a brief um
04:14
a little bit about what where christmas
04:16
tower is and what is christmas town for
04:18
the people who haven't heard you talk
04:20
about it before
04:21
christmas town is actually a place in
04:24
heaven
04:25
and for those who don't know me um
04:27
you you may not be able to
04:29
wrap your natural mind around anything
04:31
that i say because it comes by
04:33
revelation
04:34
revelation comes from the heart of the
04:36
father it's not man's thoughts man's
04:38
ideas are man's plans
04:40
it's god's and so i've been taking on
04:44
tours of heaven not just once but many
04:46
times and before you start you know
04:48
beating me up i forgive you i forgive
04:50
everybody out there so don't waste your
04:52
time doing that i have too much of a
04:54
life to live for jesus christ
04:56
but i do want to say this years ago
05:00
kenneth hagin senior has somebody
05:02
working for him who actually still on
05:03
this earth her name is billy brim
05:06
and um and he would tell billy brim
05:09
before these days are over
05:11
uh things that will begin to happen he
05:14
said i won't be here this kenneth hagin
05:15
senior speaking to billy brim who worked
05:17
for him okay
05:19
and uh and he said to her before these
05:21
days are all over something great will
05:23
begin to happen god will begin to catch
05:26
people up to heaven and taking them on
05:27
tours
05:29
really those are his words and then
05:31
bringing them back to earth this is
05:33
without dying so they can share
05:35
revelation about heaven and that he said
05:37
that to billy brim and when she found
05:40
out about me she was so excited she
05:42
called me i sent her my first book i
05:44
think i sent her the second book too and
05:47
she said she knew this was true because
05:49
years ago kenneth hagin senior who's now
05:51
in heaven uh had told her this would
05:54
happen and she saw that i was taken on
05:56
tours continually she knew that was the
05:58
truth so there's somebody right there
06:00
who's an eyewitness
06:01
that god had this plane all along i just
06:04
happened to be one of those people i've
06:06
been taking in many places in heaven
06:07
over the last 20 some years and i was
06:10
taken to exciting profound places that
06:13
were so filled with awe and wonder but
06:16
has also taken places to have fun
06:20
and the father said to me why would i
06:22
not have fun if i said in my word you
06:24
know you must come like a little child
06:27
he said i'd be in a lot of trouble if i
06:28
didn't have fun places for people who
06:30
are like little kids to play in and one
06:33
of the places i was taken to
06:36
is a place in heaven where it snows all
06:38
the time now i know a lot of people are
06:40
going to love this more will love it
06:42
than not
06:43
it snows all the time but you have to
06:45
remember i'm talking about heaven not
06:47
the earth the snow is alive
06:50
everything in heaven has life the plants
06:53
sing the plants talk the birds the
06:55
creatures even the buildings shout out
06:58
the ground shouts out all the time and
07:00
worships jesus christ they have a place
07:02
called the friendly forest you can go
07:03
and have conversations with trees with
07:05
the rocks uh with the creatures there's
07:08
so much life there you can't escape it
07:09
so i hope that under makes you
07:11
understand
07:12
in in christmas time when you go there
07:14
that is where nicholas lives
07:17
yes nick some people call him saint nick
07:19
some people come saying you call them
07:20
whatever his actual name is nicholas and
07:23
god created a place he knew one day so
07:27
this place has been around don't go into
07:29
the druids and all the stuff that it's a
07:31
bad place and it's part of this thing
07:33
this thing i'm sorry but god was there
07:35
heaven was there before anybody was born
07:37
on the earth he had places already
07:40
planned in heaven that he knew that we
07:42
would love to come there and he knew
07:44
people would come home and use their
07:45
gifts in heaven which is what you do
07:48
so nicholas had a place all prepared for
07:51
him when he passed to come nicholas
07:54
lived in the 3rd century i think 270 a.d
07:57
that's really close you know it's only
07:59
270 years after christ died so everybody
08:02
was still talking about him knew about
08:04
him in those days but of course you know
08:06
our enemy satan wasn't happy about that
08:08
so he'd always send people out into the
08:10
crowds into places to talk against
08:13
the deity and the person of jesus christ
08:16
so nicholas was actually this is the
08:18
person who people then made him become
08:20
like santa claus he actually was a very
08:23
wealthy person he lived in turkey you
08:25
can look all this up even i think
08:26
wikipedia talks about it he lived in
08:29
turkey and uh he would offender of the
08:31
faith and i think he was even a bishop
08:34
but he was very fierce when people would
08:36
attack the person of jesus christ or
08:38
speak against who he was
08:40
he had a staff he would use that staff
08:42
for things other than leading his sleigh
08:45
how about that people he actually had a
08:47
sleigh he would take gifts to children
08:50
he used to set them outside their home
08:52
at that certain time of the year and
08:54
then thieves would begin to come by and
08:56
get it so he is the one who actually
08:58
started the whole stocking thing the
09:00
parents would hang stockings inside and
09:02
nicholas would come by and leave gifts
09:04
for them this is the truth i'm telling
09:06
you and so all that came the wonderful
09:09
story we have now but i do want to say
09:12
this he lives there he loves the snow
09:14
it's known where he lived on earth
09:16
and so god created this beautiful place
09:18
when you make a snowman in christmas
09:20
town in heaven it is alive so i kind of
09:23
want some of the christmas songs and the
09:25
things that they say
09:27
uh your sleigh can go through through
09:29
the air it can go on the ground uh
09:31
there's all kinds of things to enjoy
09:33
there ice skating and i i learned from
09:36
the father that our seasons on the earth
09:40
are here there's four main seasons
09:42
and we know that there's winter summer
09:44
spring and fall
09:46
and god said i took a a shadow of an
09:49
actual place
09:51
that existed in heaven i took a shadow
09:53
of it and made it a season on the earth
09:56
so that's one of the reasons why we have
09:58
snow on the earth because it is in
10:00
heaven it was there first and so he made
10:02
this beautiful place it's like this
10:04
beautiful village and everybody goes
10:06
there with their families who are in
10:08
heaven and yes everybody gives gifts but
10:11
then excuse me the main thing they do in
10:13
christmas town is they celebrate the
10:16
birth of jesus christ
10:18
it's like happy birthday all the time in
10:20
heaven because people go to there to see
10:22
sometimes jesus will show up and people
10:24
will bring him gifts they pile gifts
10:26
gifts you know at a place for him
10:28
but they get gifts before they leave
10:30
christmas town because they're huge
10:32
trees in christmas town and all the
10:35
lights on the trees are baby stars
10:38
like that he plucked out of the sky put
10:40
them on the trees and they all sing
10:42
worship music to jesus but they also
10:44
sing christmas songs
10:46
so this is a delightful place that the
10:49
kids will love to go but even big kids
10:51
you know parents and whole families go
10:53
to this beautiful place and they really
10:56
enjoy it
10:57
so that's where nicholas lives he made
10:59
this place where nicholas has a shop
11:03
he still makes toys
11:04
and my brother recently passed and he
11:06
used to say all the time when i get to
11:08
heaven one day i'll work with saint
11:09
nipple guess what he does
11:14
my brother would create toys on the
11:15
earth every single christmas he would
11:18
dress to santa claus he would go give
11:19
gifts away he'd visit places to be be
11:22
that person of course the honor of jesus
11:24
christ in his heart more than anything
11:26
else and i want you to know
11:28
nicholas himself loves jesus christ and
11:31
that's why therefore the shirt you know
11:33
here's a shirt right here with santa and
11:36
having doing selfies with jesus
11:41
and so people people just love some
11:43
people live in christmas town i mean
11:45
that's where their mansions are and so
11:47
it's a really fun exciting place to be
11:50
wow that's so awesome i can't wait to go
11:54
and see that myself and all the all the
11:57
kids questions um i asked i even asked
12:00
my daughter this morning i knew i was
12:01
coming on with you and i i said to her
12:03
her name's lily and i said lily if
12:05
there's one question you could ask what
12:07
would you want to ask and she thought
12:09
for a while she had a couple questions
12:11
but um michael could you pull up i i put
12:14
a little video of her asking you uh can
12:17
we pull that up
12:19
hey mrs cat um where where is eva's
12:22
favorite place to go in heaven
12:25
jesus's favorite place to go in heaven
12:28
would be christmas town
12:32
it really is he visits here a lot
12:35
he actually makes toys with nicholas he
12:39
goes to his shop because you have to
12:40
remember
12:42
jesus was a carpenter on the earth uh
12:44
when he actually walked on the earth and
12:47
people go well he built houses he built
12:49
furniture he made toys too
12:51
uh jesus loved children you could see
12:54
all through the new testament that he
12:55
would be with the little children he
12:57
said don't keep them from coming to me
12:59
he loved he loved to talk with him and
13:01
play with them but he would make toys
13:02
for them too so guess what he's using
13:04
his gift he had on the earth in heaven
13:08
he also loves the snow he loves the
13:10
beauty of it
13:11
and everyone loves to see him and they
13:15
all run want to run up and hug jesus and
13:17
guess what they take pictures with him
13:18
in heaven how about that
13:20
uh they do have a way to do that you
13:22
think people are taking pictures down to
13:23
earth where do you get to heaven one day
13:25
so i would say definitely christmas town
13:28
is one of his most favorite places
13:30
oh she's gonna love that um and
13:34
annabelle is eight she's nine years old
13:36
and she wants to know if you paint a
13:38
picture in heaven can you hop right into
13:42
it and does it become real
13:46
that's what i remember some of the
13:47
movies on the years that were made
13:49
people need to understand all those
13:50
great movies the decent fun ones
13:54
a lot of those places are in heaven i'm
13:57
not going to give you a list of some of
13:58
those movies but but we all know that
14:01
there is one that shows something like
14:02
that happen there's so much creativity
14:06
and as i said everything alive is in
14:07
heaven just to give you another idea uh
14:10
there's a whole place called the
14:11
galleria where all the artists come now
14:13
people would think oh you know that
14:14
would be like rembrandt or somebody like
14:17
that no anybody in heaven who has a gift
14:19
you paint or loves to paint there's even
14:22
a whole section for children
14:24
and what they paint does come to life
14:27
now before you think in your natural
14:29
earth head there's nothing wicked
14:32
there's no bad there's no witchcraft no
14:34
darkness no evil none of that is in
14:36
anything anyone does in heaven it
14:38
doesn't even exist there so your
14:40
thoughts your creativity is not ever
14:42
tied to the darkness so you understand
14:44
that but fun excitement you know those
14:48
type of things definitely yes your art
14:50
would come alive but not only does it
14:52
come alive there if you are an artist in
14:55
heaven you have a gallery of your own
14:57
you have a studio that's part of your
14:59
mansion people come to get the art you
15:02
create and you give it away now when
15:04
they take that art home and hang it on
15:06
the wall guess what it comes alive
15:09
oh my god so so she actually thought of
15:13
something that really does happen in
15:16
heaven not just in the galleria area
15:18
where all the artists come but in
15:20
anybody's home they'll come by no matter
15:22
what you create or make that's your gift
15:24
you give it away there's no money
15:26
everything is given freely but how
15:28
delightful for somebody maybe sees a
15:31
magnificent
15:32
horse picture and they take it home and
15:33
hang out and all of a sudden that horse
15:34
is galloping in the picture
15:37
so yes that is exactly true it does come
15:39
alive and not only can you jump into
15:41
your art
15:43
there's a place called cartoon village
15:45
in heaven that he also made for children
15:48
and when you go there you can create
15:49
cartoon of movies with your friends and
15:51
then you become a cartoon and you jump
15:54
in the movie the cartoon and all your
15:56
friends can come and see and watch it
15:58
and when it's over you step back up and
16:00
then you're you again
16:01
so i'm telling you people that think
16:03
kevin is boring they don't know very
16:05
much about it so you were absolutely
16:07
right yes you can jump into your artwork
16:10
and then you're there in the art
16:13
wow oh that's exciting annabelle i know
16:15
you're going to be excited about that so
16:17
think about what you're going to draw
16:19
when you get there annabelle because
16:20
you're going to be able to to be part of
16:22
it
16:23
okay the next question is from
16:25
evangeline and she's four years old and
16:28
she says can i have a rainbow house with
16:31
rainbow things in heaven
16:34
hi evangeline of course you can it is
16:37
heaven
16:38
um mansions are made out of almost
16:41
anything that you can think of but
16:42
totally that rainbow comes from the
16:45
father it's living it moves in and out
16:47
it's on a lot of places in heaven you
16:50
yourself can become rainbow color if you
16:52
want to
16:53
the clothing you wear changes color so
16:56
why wouldn't you be able to have a
16:57
rainbow house i would say yes that would
17:00
definitely be a yes
17:02
oh that's that's exciting my daughter's
17:04
gonna love that too evangeline because
17:06
she always talks about i want to ride on
17:08
the rainbow i want to slide on the
17:10
rainbow and i think i've said in heaven
17:13
i bet you can that's always how i answer
17:15
in heaven you can and then michael is
17:18
age eight this is my son and i asked him
17:21
to ask you a question and he said can i
17:23
have a house made out of candy
17:26
oh no everybody every child wants their
17:30
house made out candy and the best part
17:32
is you can eat it and it comes right
17:34
back uh because it's heaven
17:37
there's a whole place called jello land
17:40
in heaven it really does exist and then
17:42
part of that land of course there's
17:44
there's houses made out of candy they're
17:46
made out of all kinds of things uh
17:49
flowers a whole house made out of
17:50
flowers and they sing to you all the
17:52
time when you come to your mansion and
17:55
uh but candy is one of the most favorite
17:57
things i know there's chocolate
17:58
waterfalls probably would be a part of
18:00
that mansion made out of candy uh you
18:03
can just go jump out in the waterfall
18:04
and drink the chocolate or swim in the
18:06
chocolate and so yes and in the jello
18:09
lamb part of it people will reach out
18:10
and they'll take you know a bite of the
18:12
house or take a handful the house need
18:13
it then it comes right back
18:15
you can bounce in the jello land houses
18:18
also and uh but the candy house i think
18:21
is a great idea it makes me think of
18:22
that game candy land
18:24
so let me tell you i will say this jesus
18:27
christ
18:29
does have a soft part in his heart for
18:32
sweets he loves sweets and so he'd
18:35
probably be right there with you you
18:36
know tasting the chocolate or the candy
18:38
canes or whatever else was made your
18:40
house was made out of so the answer is
18:42
absolutely yes you could have a house
18:44
made out of candy
18:46
oh well he's gonna be really excited
18:48
about that because that is his question
18:49
he's asked me many times cat he said do
18:52
you think i can have a candy house and i
18:54
said well with the lord all things are
18:56
possible so i'm sure yes you can
18:59
yes that's absolutely true
19:01
now we're gonna we're gonna move uh now
19:03
to questions from adults so they're a
19:06
little different than the kids questions
19:08
i have i have noticed that um so the
19:10
first question is from illumination and
19:13
she actually um is behind the scenes
19:16
here and she wants to know my grandma
19:19
went to heaven in 2019 and she
19:21
absolutely loves christmas even her
19:24
memorial service was christmas themed is
19:27
it possible that jesus would give her a
19:29
home in christmas town because she loved
19:31
it so much on earth
19:33
i'm sure he had started building it your
19:36
your mansion gets started being built
19:38
when you're born
19:40
uh when you're born he starts working on
19:42
okay now in heaven there's no time so
19:44
it's not like wow was that 10 years 20
19:46
30 40 50 years
19:48
and usually he times you're coming home
19:50
to heaven with your mansion being done
19:53
so i promise you he already knew what
19:55
she loved you know he sees and hears us
19:57
on the earth i assure you that he had
20:00
already built that house in christmas
20:02
town knowing her love for that so
20:04
if you want to visit her when you get to
20:05
heaven you will be going to christmas
20:07
town probably going on sleigh rides she
20:09
might come to your mention and pick you
20:11
up in the sleigh and then you can go see
20:13
her mansion a lot of that type of things
20:15
happens in heaven so
20:17
i'm sure yes that she lives in christmas
20:20
town
20:21
oh that's awesome well there you go
20:23
elimination she we talked a little bit
20:25
behind the scenes and she said i feel
20:26
like the answer is yes but i i just want
20:28
to hear from cat what what she has to
20:30
say about it so paulette is our next
20:33
question and paulette um asks does
20:36
heaven celebrate jesus's
20:38
earthly birthday
20:40
yes
20:43
can i hold up something you can zoom in
20:45
on it and i'm just gonna show them this
20:47
is a new product not we've already been
20:49
selling about a hundred so it's not
20:51
about buying it but i want to show you
20:53
uh how much they celebrate the birth of
20:56
christ this is a scene i actually saw in
20:58
heaven now this is part of the scene i
21:00
might show you the artwork for the rest
21:02
of it in a minute but this is a scene in
21:04
heaven of a little girl uh who lives in
21:07
heaven and she's riding on a sled with
21:10
the snowman she built
21:12
on the front of the sled actually says
21:14
happy birthday jesus because i had
21:16
already said that everybody celebrates
21:18
the birth of christ in heaven and so
21:20
here they are on their slide you might
21:22
have to tell me if i can can you see it
21:25
yes
21:26
can you see the little the girl the
21:28
snowman her pet
21:31
is also there and there it says at the
21:33
bottom happy birthday jesus
21:36
so yes they do celebrate the birth of
21:39
christ in christmastown
21:41
and uh and everybody loves to come
21:43
there's one of the reasons they actually
21:45
do come there they all sing happy
21:46
birthday to him they have non-stop cake
21:50
people
21:54
was gonna get cake in christmas town and
21:57
hot chocolate you know and
21:59
and other things like that you're
22:00
definitely going to experience that but
22:02
but it is the number one place people
22:04
would think it would be some other place
22:06
maybe religious place but nope this is
22:09
where he chooses and i know people it
22:12
may not have been exactly december 25th
22:14
but he loves for people to celebrate his
22:16
birthday and also created christmas
22:19
towns so people would be able to go
22:20
there to do that
22:21
[Music]
22:22
and in christmas town today is there um
22:25
a big christmas dinner
22:27
uh constance wants to know this and it
22:29
kind of links with the last question is
22:31
there a big christmas dinner in heaven
22:34
for christmas
22:36
and
22:39
why do you um we do it on the earth
22:43
many of the things we actually do and
22:45
the holidays we celebrate they already
22:47
celebrate those in heaven
22:49
and absolutely you're going to eat and
22:52
people can eat all they want to there's
22:53
no weight gain no no allergies no food
22:56
allergies
22:57
and so absolutely how would that be to
22:59
celebrate during that time what what
23:01
represents the time of the year why
23:03
would there not be a feast yes there is
23:06
definitely a big feast the good part is
23:09
this no animals life is taken
23:12
god makes all the food out of light but
23:14
it tastes like turkey it tastes like it
23:17
tastes like ham it tastes like pie
23:18
whatever you love to eat but they
23:21
certainly have a a non an ongoing feast
23:25
in christmas town
23:27
wow that's awesome i can't wait to eat
23:30
in heaven i know i've heard you talk
23:31
about it before
23:33
about how big also isn't the food really
23:36
big in size there oh yes like the pizza
23:39
place that was taken to a place called
23:41
pizza joe's in heaven
23:43
and the pizzas were the size of the
23:46
table it was sitting on now this was a
23:49
round table
23:50
this round table will seat about eight
23:52
people now when i say the word table
23:54
don't think i'm talking about just a
23:55
normal table that's not like that it's
23:58
filled with light and you have like your
24:01
your plate or you can eat on slides out
24:03
in front of you
24:04
and then you just point you you eat a
24:06
slice of pizza it's about this big i
24:08
can't even get it i can't even get it
24:11
the pizza slice is so big you have to
24:14
hold it with both hands to eat it it was
24:16
the best tasting pizza i had ever had in
24:19
my life and right next to that is an
24:21
italian restaurant where the meatballs
24:24
are like
24:25
[Laughter]
24:29
and the guy who the guy who has that he
24:32
had an italian restaurant on the earth
24:34
it was his gift he loved to cook for
24:35
people
24:36
he has a chef's hat on he has one of
24:38
those handlebar mustaches and
24:41
he's really really happy person so yeah
24:43
i've been to like an italian restaurant
24:45
the ice cream parlor oh my goodness the
24:49
the scoops are this big of the ice cream
24:52
and you can even create your own kind of
24:54
ice cream in this ice cream shop and
24:56
then they change and they add a name to
24:58
the um the menu up there what you can
25:01
order and you can you can name the ice
25:02
cream yourself
25:04
wow that's so awesome
25:07
and i know i i love to bake so i'm a big
25:10
baker and i thought when you talked
25:12
about christmas town how the artists
25:14
where um they give away their paintings
25:16
is it the same with bakeries like we can
25:18
make really huge christmas cookies and
25:20
then give them away to all our neighbors
25:23
oh yes you can they'll probably be lined
25:25
up outside
25:29
you can give away your baked goods and i
25:31
know people they say i don't know what
25:33
my gift is and yet oh my word they like
25:35
to make the best brownies on the earth
25:37
and when are you kidding it's going to
25:39
be making brownies you know they love to
25:41
do it they love to give them away as
25:42
gifts
25:44
uh people who are blessed on the earth
25:45
are the ones who who get to operate in
25:47
their gift now
25:49
and so uh they they're used to do that
25:51
but in heaven nobody misses their true
25:53
destiny
25:54
god sent us all as a gift with a gift it
25:58
wasn't not talking about a spiritual
25:59
group talk about a natural gift that
26:01
everybody can enjoy
26:03
and uh and we know people who sing
26:05
they're singing amazing that's their
26:07
gift people in sports they play really
26:08
well that's their gift but there's a lot
26:10
of other gifts gifts there's like design
26:13
you know or baking i can tell you that
26:16
that food and baking and stuff like that
26:18
is considered an art in heaven
26:23
that's awesome
26:24
i can't wait to bake and and i bet the
26:26
the machinery there is like incredible
26:29
too
26:30
like
26:31
huge mixers times 10.
26:34
yes it's incred the thing is is now
26:36
if you want to have a bakery that will
26:39
be part of your mansion you don't have a
26:41
place where you live in a place where
26:42
you work and it's not work when you love
26:45
it right
26:46
so you would go to your mansion to visit
26:48
your bakery and all your good you'd have
26:51
a showroom with all the food there you
26:53
had made and yes they do have kitchens
26:55
in heaven if you want one now if you're
26:58
gonna be a baker you're gonna have to
26:59
have a kitchen you probably have people
27:01
a sign that that's their gift is to help
27:03
in that um unless it's one of the little
27:06
tiny angels that looks sort of like an
27:08
elf and i'm just gonna get bash for that
27:10
but i don't care uh there are ones that
27:12
you have little helpers assigned in
27:14
heaven if you have a bakery because you
27:15
know you know if you got a half a
27:17
million people coming to get your goods
27:18
you need help
27:20
yes
27:21
and so it's a whole different life
27:24
because i've seen the kitchen of someone
27:26
who loved to feed people her dining room
27:29
seated 100 people and it was a dining
27:31
room in her mansion and in her kitchen
27:33
had such high tech i didn't even know
27:36
what some of the stuff was this is one
27:38
of the best parts about heaven if you
27:39
choose to cook i saw this woman making a
27:42
massive salad that was going to be
27:44
served
27:45
to all of her guests and she was peeling
27:47
like a cucumber and as she peeled it in
27:49
the in the and it came off of the
27:51
cucumber it disappeared there's no waste
27:54
there's no trash there's no cleanup how
27:57
about that isn't that awesome hallelujah
28:01
there's no cleanup no garbage to take
28:03
out people there's there's no waste
28:04
dumps and having to leave stuff
28:07
it just disappears and um
28:10
that's like back to the waterfall
28:11
chocolate waterfalls you can get in and
28:13
swim around you have chocolate all over
28:15
you but when you step out of it it's
28:16
gone
28:18
so but the food thing in heaven just
28:20
amazed me that everything you eat is
28:22
made out of life but your substance i
28:24
know people think well light is
28:26
something you can't really touch or feel
28:28
and heaven it is it's the number one
28:30
thing that things are made out of in
28:32
heaven actually your spirit man is made
28:34
out of light but you don't float around
28:36
like a little cloud in heaven you walk
28:38
on the streets you use your stuff in
28:40
your mansion you ride the horses uh it's
28:43
an actual life it's a literal life in
28:46
heaven
28:47
wow that's awesome well i'm excited to
28:50
go and cook in heaven i'm telling you
28:52
that i've had that deep within me where
28:54
i'm like i can't wait to cook and bake
28:56
and give away my stuff in heaven because
28:58
that is your visit your place yes
29:01
please do please everybody come visit me
29:04
please okay
29:05
um
29:06
elaine elaine wants to know can you
29:08
describe how jesus became a seed and was
29:12
planted in the womb of young mary
29:15
that's awesome
29:17
there's actually a story the holy spirit
29:19
told me one time
29:20
it's called twas the year before
29:22
christmas
29:24
and i'm just going to share a little
29:25
part of it i'll probably have it printed
29:27
out later on there but it starts like
29:29
twas the year before christmas when all
29:32
through father's house every creature
29:34
was stirring yes even the mouse
29:37
there was so much activity like uh maybe
29:41
um earth time a year before that when it
29:44
was being announced that the word
29:47
who was christ in heaven the word was
29:49
going to be sent to earth as a baby to
29:52
be raised up to walk among the people
29:55
here
29:56
and then one day would give himself for
29:58
them so
30:00
i don't know if people even think about
30:02
this they think well they're just
30:03
supernatural they just fly around do
30:05
whatever they want to do oh no there's
30:06
much planning in heaven and explaining
30:09
in heaven because you have to understand
30:11
the angels were there long before we
30:14
were put on the earth
30:16
and so there was all kinds of activity
30:18
in heaven all the time they'd be sent on
30:19
assignments places throughout the cosmos
30:22
and
30:23
things so much activity going on in
30:25
heaven
30:26
because people were on the earth you
30:28
know people were living on the earth at
30:29
the time christ was born and so the
30:32
father had to take the word and explain
30:34
to him this is the plan this is the plan
30:38
i have for you
30:39
you will have flesh on you number one
30:41
the word was all spirit but like i
30:43
explained in heaven that's like a whole
30:45
different realm the spiritual realm to a
30:48
spiritual person would be literal like
30:50
i'm touching this like i'm holding this
30:53
cup right here see in heaven if you had
30:55
something to drink uh you would also
30:58
touch the cup and drink out of it even
31:00
though it's a spiritual world uh it
31:03
still had life and activity and there
31:05
was building going on plans being made
31:08
talking about people who had just come
31:09
home to heaven people getting to greet
31:11
them so but heaven does like to have a
31:14
lot of celebrations so this was a
31:16
different time when the father called
31:18
the word to see him and explained to him
31:21
talked to him he said would you be
31:22
willing to do this he asked him we know
31:25
it was it was at that time it was a
31:27
father the word and holy spirit
31:31
and when the father would want to create
31:33
something when there was nothing he
31:35
would go somewhere where there was
31:36
nothing he would speak what he wanted
31:38
the word would step out of him
31:40
and you have to understand in the
31:42
spiritual world the father the father
31:44
son holy spirit can step inside of each
31:46
other that's what makes them one the
31:48
three in one
31:50
so they would go places together and i'm
31:52
thinking the word probably thought oh
31:53
we're going to go create something but
31:55
the father took him aside and explained
31:56
to him it's time now
31:59
for hope to come to the earth
32:02
and therefore my plan is to send you
32:05
as a baby to be a baby on you to be
32:08
raised by a wonderful mom
32:10
and then one day you would grow up and
32:12
then you would give yourself
32:14
for the sins of the world
32:16
and i'm quite sure because i know we
32:18
think well they know everything the
32:20
father really does know everything
32:21
because everything comes from him
32:24
and this was his plan for man to help
32:26
man to help man on the earth they needed
32:28
help okay uh the enemy who satan was
32:31
wreaking havoc everywhere he was just
32:33
getting people to fall into darkness and
32:36
the answer was to send the light of the
32:38
world which was jesus christ so he did
32:40
explain to him he said i will take you
32:43
and i will make you into a seed and holy
32:45
spirit will take you down to the earth
32:47
hover over mary and plant you in the
32:50
womb of mary
32:52
and i know people don't think about this
32:54
too much when they just read the word
32:55
but you should really study the word
32:58
it says in there that he was planted in
33:00
this as a seed in mary and later because
33:03
we know man carries a seed i won't get
33:05
into all that normally the man carries a
33:07
seed and then you get married then you
33:08
have children but this was totally
33:10
different
33:11
uh this was a supernatural divine thing
33:14
that happened that the father
33:16
took the word who was his son made him
33:18
into a seed the holy spirit hovered over
33:20
the womb of mary and even talks about it
33:22
in the bible and then she he was he was
33:24
planted as a seed grew up in mary was
33:28
burst into the earth as a real being he
33:30
had flesh on him okay
33:33
why did he have to have flesh so that
33:34
people could see him because on the
33:37
earth normally you don't see spiritual
33:39
beings unless god opens your eyes to
33:41
that spirit realm which is also all
33:43
around us so he had to explain not only
33:46
to him what he was going to do he had to
33:48
take all the tribes of angels and
33:50
explain to them this is what is going to
33:52
happen
33:53
it's going to be different now it'll be
33:55
different because redemption is coming
33:57
to mankind the word has said yes he's
34:00
willing to do this
34:01
and then he will be known on the earth
34:03
as my son who one day will give himself
34:06
they were totally they were undone
34:09
because this was something that had
34:10
never happened before
34:12
i know when new things happen on the
34:14
earth people think oh that couldn't
34:15
happen or that won't happen but you know
34:17
heaven has been through many things like
34:18
we have there was even there was kind of
34:21
war one time in heaven that was when
34:22
satan tried to take over and he was
34:24
kicked out in a lightning bolt
34:26
uh so they've experienced that all of
34:28
that happening so this was new news even
34:31
for them a new revelation so now the
34:33
word was being sent to the earth
34:35
would be not not recognized on the earth
34:38
because when he was the word he was a
34:39
spiritual body and he's going to have
34:42
flesh on him so he'll look different and
34:44
they could watch from having to see
34:45
everything going on
34:46
so yes on that beautiful morning
34:50
nine months after the holy spirit
34:51
hovered over mary and planted that seed
34:54
uh jesus christ and then he was born
34:57
into this earth such a celebration in
34:59
heaven took place um that the host came
35:02
in saying to the shepherds gabriel came
35:04
to announce his birth
35:06
i'm sure there was quite a sight uh you
35:09
know here on the earth to see this all
35:11
this activity going on it was very major
35:14
for the father to give his son as a gift
35:17
to this world
35:19
and that's why god loves it when we give
35:21
gifts just so you realize
35:23
christmas time on the earth is so
35:25
precious to god it represents us loving
35:27
one another giving gifts to each other
35:30
helping each other you know making a
35:31
difference bringing hope when christ
35:33
came
35:34
as that child he began to bring hope to
35:36
people
35:37
everything was going to change about
35:40
when you pass from this earth you could
35:42
go back home to heaven having received
35:45
christ as your savior so this is one of
35:46
the best gifts ever given to the earth
35:49
would be
35:50
jesus christ the son of the living god
35:52
and he was raised just like you and i
35:55
had to be a little baby learn to walk
35:57
and learn to read and write and i do
36:00
know this about jesus he loved reading
36:03
when he was being schooled on the earth
36:04
he didn't care too much about writing
36:07
and i love the holy spirit he said
36:08
that's why there's only 10 commandments
36:10
instead of 20 because he didn't care too
36:12
much about writing that's a joke in case
36:14
you didn't get it
36:16
so anyway the star coming several years
36:19
before the birth of christ that the wise
36:21
men came across the deserts
36:23
and some people see them in a little
36:25
play here's the three kings they were
36:27
from different countries they saw the
36:30
star of christ in the east so they
36:32
traveled east from the desert regions
36:34
from three different countries it took
36:36
them two years to cross those deserts to
36:39
come and bring the gifts to
36:41
to to jesus and i don't know that he was
36:43
living in the manger at that time they
36:45
did come to honor him recognize who he
36:47
was so even people on in other countries
36:50
knew something special had happened
36:53
and so from that point on jesus lived
36:56
his life walked out his life on this
36:57
earth so that he could become our
37:00
sacrifice and what he was doing was
37:02
making a way back to the father so i
37:05
will say this the day you pass and you
37:08
step out of this body and you're going
37:10
home to heaven jesus will come get you
37:12
he's the one who walks you up the steps
37:14
of the throne and says look father your
37:17
if your son or daughter your son or your
37:19
daughter whichever one is has come home
37:21
to you
37:22
that's part of the blessing that christ
37:25
gets for having given himself for so but
37:28
it was all a stir in heaven all these
37:30
people these these creatures and these
37:33
angels and the host of heaven the army
37:35
they were all talking back and forth
37:36
non-stop did you hear the words going to
37:38
go to earth did you hear he's going to
37:40
be a baby uh that sounds to them that
37:42
was like sort of wild but they knew when
37:44
the father said something it was going
37:46
to happen
37:47
so all of heaven prepared for this to
37:49
happen things were repaired on the earth
37:51
people were put in place there would be
37:54
a part of this whole story of his birth
37:56
how they had to travel they were told
37:58
they had to travel to uh you know be
38:00
accountable for who they were and
38:01
register
38:03
and that happened to be in bethlehem how
38:05
about that and god had already placed
38:07
his star in the heavens to be seen
38:10
uh two years before this happened so
38:12
that's the true story of why we
38:15
celebrate this time of the year is
38:17
because we celebrate the birth of jesus
38:20
christ who came for us because he loved
38:22
us the father loved us
38:25
the holy spirit loved us and this is
38:27
their plan
38:28
for you for i for every person in the
38:30
earth god desires that none should
38:32
perish but you have to choose jesus
38:34
christ to live in this beautiful place
38:36
this world called heaven that is the
38:39
father's house
38:42
that's beautiful when you talk about
38:45
jesus walking us up the stairs back to
38:47
the father
38:50
i mean that
38:51
touches my heart so deeply because it's
38:54
i can just imagine that and the beauty
38:57
of
38:58
seeing the father and just the love that
39:01
must come and
39:03
washed over you as you're with
39:05
jesus and seeing the thought oh i just
39:08
can't wait for that day
39:09
oh you're already undone
39:12
that
39:13
that jesus christ
39:14
is with you
39:16
you hear about him people have
39:18
encounters sometimes i already got the
39:19
spirit of god all over me right now
39:21
you hear stories of people encountering
39:23
him on the earth and i can say i have
39:26
seen him many times but it is never
39:29
normal i'm so undone every time consumed
39:32
by the love that just comes from him it
39:35
it just permeates every part of your
39:37
body and you forget about every care you
39:39
have you're not you're not listening so
39:41
much to all the stuff going on right now
39:43
in this world god has a plan for this
39:45
world okay it says the earth is the
39:48
lord's and the fullness thereof this
39:50
earth belongs to jesus christ he paid a
39:52
price for it and he knows what's going
39:54
on let me tell you there's stuff that's
39:56
going to be exposed i can just say get
39:58
ready for some great great days ahead no
40:00
matter what the enemy thinks they're
40:02
going to do god has a plan to be in some
40:04
of the greatest days if you're young you
40:06
have the most powerful amazing future
40:09
ever on the earth to do great things for
40:11
him the creativity will be so powerful
40:14
and amazing people will be shocked some
40:16
of the stuff will be created on the
40:17
earth to help us our life to be better
40:20
and and happier but the number one thing
40:22
that will happen is the presence of the
40:25
lord is about to consume this whole
40:27
earth and the knowledge of that glory
40:30
will be seen and known all over the
40:31
earth
40:33
hallelujah i feel i feel that so strong
40:36
when you talk about that it's it's going
40:38
to be an awesome time it's awesome time
40:41
to be alive
40:42
uh there was some there's someone who
40:44
asked a question about i wanted to find
40:47
it real quick because they asked about
40:48
the oh the shepherds here we go sally
40:51
asked about um what happened to the
40:54
shepherds to whom the angels appeared
40:57
30 years later did they connect with
41:00
jesus um the baby they had seen or did
41:03
they always wonder what happened to that
41:06
baby have you seen any of those
41:08
shepherds in heaven
41:10
um i'm sure the shepherds made it happen
41:13
i will tell you this they never forgot
41:16
what they saw
41:17
i mean here is one of the one one of the
41:19
archangels appearing and gabriel is
41:21
beautiful he's so glorious i'm sure the
41:24
sky lit up you know the sky open person
41:28
lit up and here he's given this glorious
41:30
announcement you know that this messiah
41:33
is being born the son of god has come to
41:35
be amongst mankind and i can tell you
41:38
that i will say this too that where it
41:40
talks about the great host appeared the
41:42
ones that sang were actually part of the
41:44
army of heaven okay
41:47
and you know it says in the bible that
41:48
the shepherds were afraid they were so
41:50
afraid that their body hurt now they
41:52
weren't going to be hurt but they'd
41:53
never seen anything like this so you can
41:55
imagine warring angels coming with
41:58
gabriel to sing and to glorify christ's
42:00
birth on the earth that's actually what
42:03
actually happened and so they were
42:05
singing i'm sure it was really loud but
42:07
it was beautiful and so you think you
42:10
saw just one angel you'd never forget it
42:12
but here you've seen multitudes of the
42:15
these armies of heaven and gabriel
42:17
and the seraphim probably were there
42:19
singing their heads are like blue fire
42:22
blue fire their hair is so can you
42:24
imagine this site and i know no one has
42:26
been there and has not seen it doesn't
42:28
understand i was taken back and i
42:30
actually saw that scene i saw what
42:32
happened because he was using the army
42:34
of heaven and i'm like no wonder no
42:37
wonder no for me because i see i'm a
42:39
seer i see the army of heaven around me
42:40
all the time i see their activities i
42:42
see them you know battling the army of
42:44
darkness and how badly they get beat
42:47
the army of darkness gets beat but so
42:50
i'm i was accustomed to seeing them but
42:51
seeing the sight
42:53
the shepherds were cowering behind rocks
42:56
or bushes their eyes were so wide you
42:58
know here's gabriel making this
43:00
beautiful announcement and then here
43:01
comes the army to sing in the heavens
43:04
and and it's the lights just like
43:05
blinding from there so you can imagine
43:08
they probably repeated that story over
43:10
and over again to everybody they knew
43:12
probably they probably didn't believe it
43:13
but it didn't matter to them when you
43:15
have an encounter you never forget it so
43:17
i'm quite sure because jesus did teach
43:20
over in that region he taught over there
43:22
there was jerusalem and other places
43:24
there
43:25
i'm sure some of the shepherds probably
43:27
eventually lived in um
43:29
in jerusalem i mean it wasn't that many
43:31
years now he was in there he was already
43:34
known as a great carpenter joseph taught
43:36
him as a master carpenter so jesus was
43:39
known as the carpenter the son of joseph
43:42
but we know he was the son of god
43:44
uh so he was known because of that
43:46
but but when jesus turned
43:49
30 he began his public ministry that
43:51
means he started demonstrating the
43:52
miracles the signs and wonders and i'm
43:55
quite sure it made it back to the ears
43:57
of those because this spread far and
43:59
wide that said i'm sure that some of
44:01
those who were in bethlehem or maybe
44:03
relooking in jerusalem they probably
44:05
knew exactly who that was when he
44:07
started talking about being the son of
44:08
god i i'm quite sure that there are some
44:11
of those shepherds are in heaven yes
44:15
wow that's awesome i i can imagine that
44:18
you went got actually got to go back and
44:20
see that whole entire scene
44:24
that's incredible oh my god i can so if
44:28
when i get to go to heaven can i go to a
44:30
place to watch that scene too
44:33
yes actually there is a place they have
44:35
um they actually have theaters in heaven
44:37
how about that now again i have to
44:39
always explain you don't have to have
44:42
ratings like r for rotten pg like partly
44:45
good g for good
44:47
uh you know i mean they actually they
44:49
they know what goes on here so any of
44:52
the theaters in heaven again there's no
44:54
darkness there's not going to be
44:55
profanity there's no no uh you know
44:58
killings none of that no violence
45:00
whatsoever so there's no dark witchcraft
45:02
none of that is in the theaters in
45:04
heaven but they have a place where you
45:05
can go
45:06
uh and you can actually watch when god
45:09
made when they made the earth you
45:11
actually get to see him creating earth
45:13
by watching it but it's not like a
45:15
screen it's like you're there
45:20
wow
45:21
oh my gosh i can't i cannot wait for
45:24
that um there's another question about
45:27
um renee asked this question and i've
45:29
heard a few people ask this question
45:31
before
45:32
um i'm seeing a lot of christians
45:34
fighting about celebrating or not
45:36
christmas is that a spirit of religion
45:39
trying to stop the celebration of
45:41
christ's birth
45:43
i think it's partly that i think it's
45:45
partly what we've been taught our whole
45:47
lives in church
45:50
you know depending on the church you go
45:51
to because you know there can be 50
45:53
churches to probably hundreds of
45:54
thousands of churches right now
45:56
and i tell you i tell people no matter
45:58
what church you go to make sure they're
46:00
teaching about the validity of jesus
46:02
christ who he is he's the only way to
46:04
heaven
46:04
i think it was that but i think totally
46:06
satan any chance satan god to draw
46:09
people away from the truth
46:12
that's the bottom line satan doesn't
46:14
want people to have fun
46:15
joy celebration but he does not want
46:18
them to have the truth because the truth
46:21
sets you free
46:23
so okay this place in heaven was created
46:26
before the earth was here
46:29
so you can't say
46:31
that christmas is some pagan holiday
46:33
sorry people
46:35
okay the pagans weren't here when god
46:38
made it in heaven however there is
46:40
someone who lived in heaven saw all the
46:42
beauty the wonder and the fun and when
46:44
he was thrown out of heaven he created
46:47
wicked evil things and said that was his
46:50
symbol that was his celebration their
46:52
lies i'm not saying there weren't these
46:55
wicked groups on the earth doing things
46:57
but satan stole different things in
46:59
heaven to make them look like they were
47:01
bad
47:02
so christmas town belongs to god
47:05
he decided to create it no human hands
47:08
made that place because it's a place of
47:10
fun of splendor a place to celebrate his
47:13
son it's in heaven he loves it when we
47:17
celebrate it on the earth and you know
47:20
what you all need to go get can you get
47:22
me the dvd real quick jen i'm going to
47:24
show you really quick a dvd i would
47:26
encourage everyone to get and watch with
47:28
your family it's called saving christmas
47:31
it's right there by kirk cameron
47:33
actually got really tired of listening
47:35
to the very thing you're talking about
47:37
he got tired of all the insults and and
47:40
and dragging you know christmas down
47:42
saying it's a pagan you shouldn't have
47:43
nothing to do with it so he went to the
47:46
word of god got all the scriptures and
47:49
wrote this script for this movie called
47:51
saving christmas it is hilarious but it
47:54
actually shows you nicholas back in the
47:56
time when he walked down the earth where
47:58
that came from and he actually explains
48:01
why christmas is so important on the
48:04
earth
48:04
like i said it's the only time some
48:06
people forgive each other it's the one
48:09
time they reach out and give to help
48:11
others even people they don't know
48:13
and we watch this many times and so i'm
48:15
just going to show you the cover i
48:17
already heard from kirk cameron's people
48:18
saying thank you for showing it
48:20
it explains everything and i think you
48:22
can get it on amazon is that where you
48:24
got it janet amazon so i'm going to
48:26
share with you right now here it is
48:28
it's called saving christmas
48:30
by kirk cameron and he explains why the
48:33
christmas tree is important are the all
48:36
the balls the lights on the tree what
48:38
they represent and you know representing
48:40
christ
48:41
even things like the nutcracker what
48:43
that represents for for heaven for
48:45
heaven on the earth and why do we eat
48:48
why do we celebrate what does all this
48:50
mean
48:51
and he shoots down
48:53
every myth
48:55
or reality of what evil has tried to
48:58
take over he explains it the best of
49:00
anyone i've ever heard so i will
49:02
encourage people get that dvd
49:05
let let yourself watch it with you and
49:07
your in your family it's the best
49:09
explanation i've heard i can just say
49:12
christmas even now people are having
49:14
more hope than they've had in like
49:16
almost two years uh hope is flooding
49:19
joyous flooding through celebration
49:22
i know most people pitch or sell heaven
49:24
is nothing but a place where you bow
49:26
down to god all the time part of the way
49:28
we worship in heaven is enjoying things
49:31
he put there that's our gratefulness for
49:33
what he gave us even in heaven so heaven
49:36
celebrates
49:38
it doesn't have funerals
49:40
there's no funerals there's no firing
49:42
squads there's no death certificates
49:44
being made out no one's crying no one's
49:47
grieving in heaven it is a celebration
49:50
of what christ did for us
49:53
by coming to this earth walking as a man
49:57
showing you the right way to live what
49:59
righteousness is what unrighteousness is
50:01
but i can tell you what there is a
50:03
copycat enemy our true enemy enemy is
50:06
satan i know he uses wicked people to do
50:09
things and then he makes up all these
50:12
occults and all these things i don't
50:14
even understand don't care about because
50:16
i'm not a part of that and i choose not
50:18
to participate or read it or watch it i
50:21
feel myself with the light of god with
50:23
his word what his plans are but i can
50:25
tell you christmas
50:27
has always had the presence of god on it
50:30
when you attend church celebrating the
50:32
birth of christ the choir singing
50:34
represents the angels that sang on the
50:37
day of his birth of some of the most
50:38
glorious songs ever made or created were
50:41
ones about christmas because in those
50:43
songs many of them talk about oh holy
50:45
night
50:46
hearts and heart the herald angels sing
50:49
and so all these beautiful things came
50:51
out of this one beautiful holiday
50:54
it's more than a holiday it's actually a
50:57
way of life that's what it is so yes i
51:00
celebrate it i will celebrate it now i
51:03
will celebrate in heaven one day it
51:05
brings families together but the gift
51:08
giving is one of the big things i know
51:10
man has commercialized it and i'm not
51:12
saying you know go go get a gift for
51:13
somebody it's a wonderful beautiful
51:14
thing to do maybe help the poor with
51:17
something
51:18
you know that's one of my favorite
51:19
things to do also but christmas is dear
51:22
to the father's heart
51:23
he made it
51:25
not a pagan
51:26
not some satanic group
51:28
even satan didn't make it he just tried
51:31
to steal it
51:32
and he lost
51:35
amen
51:36
and what this is a perfect this is a
51:38
perfect question to go along with what
51:40
you just said um there's the user it
51:43
says username because i'm happy they
51:46
asked a question um what can we give
51:48
jesus for his birthday to show him we
51:52
love and honor him i'm gonna move my
51:54
scarf over there yo
51:55
i would say
51:58
he loves cards
52:01
and uh what i do if i want to make a
52:03
card out for jesus i actually make one
52:05
out to him and i put it on my tree
52:07
i mean you don't need to put it even in
52:09
a card you can make him one
52:11
i would say he loves the kids to draw
52:13
pictures you know maybe christmas trees
52:15
or gifts or something like that
52:18
just telling him that you love him thank
52:21
him for coming to earth to be the way to
52:23
make a way back to the father
52:25
he loves it when we sing christmas
52:28
carols especially ones that talk about
52:30
the holy night and away in the manger
52:32
he loves and actually watches many of
52:36
the events put on by churches or groups
52:39
that show that scene back in the way
52:41
back in the day when christ was born and
52:43
they have someone be mary and joseph and
52:45
baby jesus and then they show you know
52:47
if they're really big ones they bring
52:49
live animals in
52:50
but he lost to see the celebration in
52:52
our heart so i would say the best gift
52:55
you could give him would be celebrate
52:57
the holiday
52:58
help people love them and remember why
53:02
we celebrate it
53:03
it is about funny gifts and you know the
53:06
joy but number one it's about a child
53:10
being born in the manger a king the king
53:12
of this world who created everything we
53:15
see and everything we touch and he's
53:17
very much a lie right now excited about
53:21
this time of the year
53:23
so i'd say make a little note telling
53:25
him that drawing a little picture
53:27
hang it on your tree
53:29
if i was a parent i would save those
53:30
somewhere in a special box one day and
53:32
say this is what you did
53:34
to celebrate our king jesus
53:37
oh that's beautiful
53:39
uh there brandon wants to know is there
53:42
spiritual significance when people here
53:45
on earth light up their homes with
53:47
christmas lights do people in heaven
53:49
light up their mansion in a similar
53:51
fashion for the sake of christmas
53:55
they have lights everywhere i can tell
53:57
you if you think that you've been driven
53:59
somewhere where they have a lot of
54:00
decorations and things
54:02
everywhere in christmas town even
54:04
outside of christmas town they all have
54:06
some kind of lights because it's
54:08
celebrating when the angels came and the
54:12
sky lit up with the glory of heaven
54:15
that's actually what those lights
54:16
represent that's what they like they
54:18
represent on your tree on your home
54:20
you're making a statement i celebrate
54:22
the birth of jesus christ i celebrate
54:25
with him in my life that i belong to him
54:29
and i'm recognizing that i'm standing
54:31
with the promises he gave me so i would
54:34
say definitely put lights up
54:36
we put lights everywhere we can
54:38
uh the other thing one more thing in the
54:40
and jesus just said to me now that
54:43
sounds wild he said don't forget the
54:46
cake
54:47
it is celebrating my birthday why not
54:50
make a cake and eat it so i can come and
54:53
see you eating the cake we actually make
54:56
a birthday cake for jesus on christmas
54:58
and at our christmas dinner we have a
55:00
birthday cake for jesus and we sing
55:02
happy birthday to him even though he
55:04
doesn't need to have that done he loves
55:06
it so don't forget to have cake or
55:09
cupcakes or something
55:10
that your children can be a part of and
55:13
celebrate with him
55:15
at a time when he had to change his
55:17
whole life
55:18
and even who he was just to come to this
55:21
earth for us
55:23
so we can sing happy birthday to jesus
55:27
on christmas and
55:28
make that part of our family tradition
55:30
with our kids so that they're always
55:33
raised knowing that it is that's why we
55:35
celebrate that's a great idea to do that
55:38
as a family for all you moms with young
55:40
kids that's a great idea we did that
55:43
growing up and now we still do it even
55:45
now we still do it so definitely you're
55:47
recognizing him you're you're honoring
55:49
him by recognizing him that he is so
55:52
special he's worth making a cake for
55:54
besides like i said he loves sweets i
55:57
didn't get to finish that when jesus was
55:59
growing up as a child he loved honeycomb
56:01
it was his favorite thing it talked
56:03
about it in the bible him and honey but
56:06
john the baptist his cousin also ate
56:08
honey and it was the sweet of that time
56:11
that would be like eating cake you know
56:13
in this day and he still loves sweets
56:16
and every time some new baker comes home
56:18
to heaven he's going to visit their shop
56:20
uh he loves his squeezing
56:23
he'll probably visit you if you make
56:24
sweet sweet
56:27
i was just making a half cake have cake
56:30
and celebrate the birth of christ
56:32
oh that's awesome well we have one i
56:35
think we can get through one more
56:36
question um christine asked my dad went
56:39
to be with god recently and he loved to
56:42
feed god's cardinals
56:45
my dad loved how the snow and the
56:47
cardinals looked would my dad be feeding
56:50
the birds in christmas town or are they
56:52
all over heaven
56:55
birds are all over heaven but i have
56:57
seen i don't know why they just look so
56:59
beautiful people make ornaments with the
57:01
red cardinals and i think i know they're
57:03
around normally other times of the year
57:05
but i just think they're represented if
57:07
you look at i got probably probably 20
57:10
christmas cards at least that had red
57:11
cardinals on them i'm not kidding
57:13
like with the tree with the snow and
57:15
everything in it i'm sure there are
57:18
birds there because the birds come to
57:19
sing happy birthday to jesus too
57:22
and so the birds will come in they'll go
57:24
out they'll come in but i have seen red
57:26
cardinals in heaven uh in christmas town
57:29
and other types of birds too but i'm
57:32
sure that they will be able to see birds
57:34
in that place singing
57:36
to jesus
57:37
oh that's beautiful well thank cat for
57:40
all the
57:41
questions today i mean they were they
57:43
were some awesome questions when i was
57:45
reading through them i was like oh my
57:46
gosh these are all you guys did an
57:48
awesome job sending in christmas time
57:50
questions i enjoyed each and every one
57:53
of them so will you just pray for us
57:56
real quick before we end uh this time
57:58
together and just bless everybody that's
58:00
listening
58:02
sure um i was gonna show one more
58:04
picture
58:05
and this represents sort of like the
58:07
army of heaven coming with gabriel
58:09
making the announcement um this is the
58:11
star right here if you can see if i can
58:14
hold it right i'll put the star you see
58:16
the star or not
58:17
yes
58:19
is it right side up
58:20
yeah there's the star of bethlehem
58:23
there's gabriel making the announcement
58:25
but the army that's with him is not
58:28
normal
58:29
and you can see some of them look like
58:31
creatures and they're singing so the
58:32
shepherds would be down on the ground
58:34
you know trying to go like oh my gosh
58:36
what is that and what is that up there
58:38
in the sky uh whenever it says host uh
58:41
in the bible they're talking about the
58:42
army of heaven
58:43
and so uh yes many of them came to sing
58:46
because you have to remember
58:48
jesus name was the lord of hosts so this
58:51
was his army coming to sing about his
58:54
birth on the earth along with gabriel
58:57
and so i had to show that real quick
58:58
picture but i will pray father i thank
59:01
you right now for blessing everybody in
59:03
this wonderful time this wonderful
59:05
season on the earth god don't let
59:08
legalism and religious mindsets set into
59:11
people that they don't think you should
59:12
celebrate it's not about fun
59:15
it totally has always been about fun the
59:18
sacrifice of your son
59:20
was one part of his life but his birth
59:23
was totally different
59:25
great celebrations were taking place in
59:27
heaven even mary and joseph and those
59:30
who were present with him they were
59:31
celebrating
59:32
and knowing he was the son of god coming
59:34
to this to this earth so father i thank
59:36
you that the reality and the presence of
59:38
jesus christ will flood everyone's home
59:41
everyone's person at this time of the
59:43
year god let love
59:45

59:49
cares you know jesus came to take them
59:52
away
59:53
i thank you for recognizing his birth
59:55
recognizing who he is but also remember
59:58
the celebration part
60:00
that they celebrate in heaven on earth
60:03

60:05

60:14
we're entering into a holy season of the
60:17
glory being released in the earth thank

01:49
in the rear view mirror you know not
01:51
that god was taken
01:52
by surprise by any of this he saw it all
01:55
ahead of time he knew what was going to
01:57
happen he wasn't shocked or starved in
01:59
fact i'm going to ask cat a question
02:00
about that when we bring her on in just
02:02
a minute but a couple of quick
02:04
announcements
02:05
for the next 90 days give or take uh
02:09
when we do johnny eno and he'll be on

04:26
in kat kerr
04:28
hi there
04:29
kat how are you doing
04:31
i'm doing great
04:32
good so you just said you're taking a
04:34
little bit of vacation so you're back
04:36
from your vacation started to do the
04:38
show and then back at it
04:40
well my vacation is i get a hotel in the
04:43
city because i have to come back and
04:45
forth here all the time so it's not like
04:47
i'm a way away that's but still you know
04:51
i'm away at the nighttime
04:53
wow nice nice family visiting and of
04:56
course right now we're not out of our
04:58
our offices yet so there's really no
05:01
place for anyone to visit me here so
05:03
just go get a really big nice hotel room
05:05
and get them some and we all can get
05:07
together and do things that's what we do
05:09
good good
05:10
i have a question that i will open with
05:12
when we go to questions
05:14
but before i do that um anything you
05:16
want to talk about current events or
05:18
anything going into next year anything
05:19
that either the lord's showing you or
05:21
what to expect i'm going to throw that
05:23
to you because we haven't pre-talked
05:24
about this i don't know if you have
05:25
anything so
05:26
oh i do absolutely the father's been
05:29
talking to me the last few days
05:31
now you have to understand when he talks
05:33
to me he talks to me like it's already
05:35
done when i say already done i mean his
05:37
plan
05:38
at the completion of his plan for
05:40
america his completion of his plan in
05:43
these days
05:44
for the world so he talks to me it's
05:46
always positive it's always powerful and
05:48
that's why i'm able to release that to
05:50
the people but i want you to know
05:53
even though it looks pretty bad in
05:54
certain places there are things still
05:56
happening i mean i i think probably the
05:59
number one thing i notice and hear about
06:01
a lot is how many people in the country
06:03
this country america are standing up
06:05
against the left i'm not going to say
06:07
much more than that
06:09
in unexpected ways and they they didn't
06:12
ever think this would all happen
06:14
i know you think it's all dragged up
06:16
they thought everything was going to be
06:17
over a couple months like they'd have us
06:19
and our whole lives would be over that's
06:21
what they had planned but the devil
06:24
always forgets
06:26
that we have god in us and this is god's
06:28
country and he doesn't know the mind of
06:31
god himself satan does not he doesn't
06:34
even know your mind unless you speak it
06:36
that's why you need to be careful what
06:37
you're saying with your mouth that's
06:39
good a lot in the atmosphere around you
06:41
you actually create an atmosphere around
06:43
you who's going to be in that atmosphere
06:45
and so make sure it's not all about doom
06:47
and gloom and fear and stuff like that
06:49
i'm not saying that kind of thing thing
06:51
isn't real but you do not have to choose
06:53
that so i can tell you god does not
06:55
choose it he's talking about the days of
06:58
glory more than he ever has before to me
07:01
because he said everything is beginning
07:03
to be like dust
07:05
and i know you probably don't understand
07:06
that as a spiritual a phrase that means
07:09
everything you're living in now or
07:11
having to be confronted with now will
07:13
become like
07:14
dust and in spiritual that means that
07:18
will be hard to see
07:19
hard to remember what that was like so
07:22
when things do happen on god's timeline
07:25
because everybody's talking about
07:27
different timelines or calendars or
07:29
whatever i go by god's timeline and if
07:32
you could be taken to heaven i'd
07:33
probably ask him to show you his own
07:35
timeline that wouldn't take you forever
07:38
because then you would know number one
07:40
you're not at certain times that people
07:42
are saying right this is not the
07:44
perilous times it is not the tribulation
07:47
and stop saying that the antichrist is
07:50
on the earth he's not on the earth
07:52
people the antichrist spirit is which is
07:55
a whole different thing but he's not
07:57
here yet okay he's not going to sit
07:59
around and wait for several hundred
08:00
years to do anything
08:02
satan however is trying to do a big
08:04
takeover right now which will fail
08:06
miserably
08:08
embarrassingly
08:10
i'm telling you what they won't want to
08:12
talk about hell and these times are
08:14
going through because of what is about
08:15
to happen they won't talk about that
08:17
part he probably won't allow them to
08:19
mention what a huge fail it was and
08:22
trying to take over this country and i
08:24
don't even have to mention names or
08:25
right or left or anything to tell you
08:27
that i'm telling you from god's plans
08:30
the days that are coming of greater
08:32
glory major changes will begin to happen
08:36
probably in the first quarter i can tell
08:38
you that much and the first quarter of
08:41
2022 uh which is some of god's great
08:44
plans to be revealed in that time and
08:46
things major things to begin to happen
08:49
and whether it's about certain
08:51
presidents or not certain presidents
08:52
fake or real or whatever god himself is
08:55
going to start doing things in the first
08:58
quarter of this 2022 i'm extremely
09:02
excited about it so i want to encourage
09:04
you you don't have to live in your soul
09:07
but every wicked terrible thing you're
09:09
hearing or watching hopefully you're not
09:11
i do want to add one thing or this is
09:13
glorious news
09:14
i happen to know actually literally
09:18
that these big networks are way down in
09:21
their viewing by 25 or 30 percent wow
09:26
yeah that is good
09:28
they're even this is on the secular
09:30
channel this was talking about this
09:32
which i i just heard about you know
09:34
literally heard about from another news
09:36
person
09:37
that they're down like i i can't mention
09:40
what networks but you know all those
09:41
who've been going along filling people
09:43
with lies
09:44
they're down by the viewing many of them
09:47
30 percent 25 which is unheard of for
09:51
major
09:52
networks
09:53
because they won't stop saying the same
09:56
thing
09:57
people are tired of hearing the same
09:58
news hey you network you're supposed to
10:00
be able to deliver the news
10:02
unbiased to give us great information
10:05
about many different things
10:07
get out of your box get out of your rut
10:09
you're stuck in a hole you may be
10:11
covered up with dirt one day
10:14
that's good this is the for real this is
10:16
a for real does not is some kind of a
10:18
spiritual kind of a thing out there
10:20
in the natural world this is really
10:22
happening for the first time on network
10:25
reviewing they they're so they're
10:27
they're filled with fear and they're
10:28
really very upset
10:30
that people aren't watching them anymore
10:32
but they're fed up with what they're
10:33
getting that should be a clue yeah for
10:36
sure for sure okay let me ask you this
10:38
because you said something and i want to
10:40
see if i heard you right you said when
10:42
things began to happen which i think you
10:43
were referring to when god starts doing
10:45
what he's about to do
10:47
you said it would be hard to remember
10:48
were you saying it's going to be hard to
10:50
remember these bad times is that what
10:52
you were saying yes that's a huge thing
10:54
that's a huge prophetic word right there
10:57
it is it will be very hard to remember
10:59
and even in the past when people went
11:01
through things and i've said this before
11:03
but i don't mind repeating myself
11:05
because god doesn't mind repeating
11:07
himself to me
11:08
he says things almost certain parts of
11:11
the day now he's continually saying
11:13
things to me
11:14
not just to keep me encouraged but every
11:16
time he speaks his frequency goes in me
11:20
and you want people want to know why are
11:21
you so fear sometimes why do you why do
11:23
you just get loud and yell because he's
11:26
yelling
11:28
because he is so he knows that he knows
11:31
that he knows if anyone else does he
11:32
does
11:33
this is what's going to happen not what
11:35
they're saying is going to happen the
11:38
new norm will be living in the glory
11:40
manifesting for god who he is in this
11:43
earth to the point where people want
11:45
believers to be their friends
11:47
wow
11:48
wow is that going to begin to go on
11:51
you will not even in your soul have room
11:54
for the past stuff that you went through
11:57
are these days which everyone's going to
11:59
realize at one point
12:01
it was all a fake
12:03
even some of those who were part of it
12:07
god removes things sometimes off the
12:10
earth in the atmosphere
12:12
even in the spirit realm some things are
12:14
just wiped out and i can prove it in the
12:16
word of god because at the very end of
12:17
the bible it says the former things will
12:20
be remembered no more there you
12:22
go well he's the only one who can do
12:24
that and i'm telling you what he's going
12:26
to do that somewhat as this whole thing
12:29
crumbles and falls
12:31
and you need to go back and look at the
12:33
november 4th report people of um was
12:36
that 20 20 20 21
12:39
no 2020 if it's november 4th it's 2020.
12:42
yeah yeah
12:43
yeah yeah go back and see that and you
12:45
hear exactly what's gonna happen guess
12:47
what he has not changed his plans
12:50
just like when he told noah build the
12:52
ark it was 120 years later people now
12:55
aren't you glad you're not noah we're
12:57
not waiting 120 years for things to not
12:59
just go back the way they were they
13:00
there's no way they can
13:02
and we don't want them to want to be
13:04
greater and more powerful
13:06
and more known in god's presence more on
13:09
the earth and creativity and inventions
13:12
and joy and celebration we've been more
13:14
on the earth than they ever before so
13:16
you can't even say i want to go back
13:19
we're going forward
13:21
we're going forward into the news that
13:23
he has for us uh new for america new for
13:26
places in this world but i can tell you
13:28
right now he's not concerned he's not
13:30
there you know
13:31
rubbing his hands or anything yeah
13:34
he knows what our beginning is he knows
13:37
what our end is and it's not the end of
13:40
ends okay
13:41
that's good that's good cat let me ask
13:44
this question you brought this up before
13:46
a couple times we've mentioned this on
13:47
the air but it's a long time in between
13:50
where someone was writing to me the
13:51
other day and she said it was so hard
13:54
because all of these things kept
13:55
happening bad and i can identify with
13:57
that because after a year and a half of
14:00
doing this give or take um a little more
14:03
than less give or take but
14:06
you see even when i try to never watch
14:08
the news some gets in it'll slip in or
14:10
i'll see something on that net while i'm
14:12
working or something like that but
14:15
the to the to the untrained eye it looks
14:18
like worse and worse and worse things
14:20
are happening
14:22
but you said once this wickedness has
14:25
been here all along god is just
14:27
uncovering that am i saying that right
14:30
you're absolutely right and almost any
14:34
time god's going to do something really
14:36
great on the earth
14:37
the first thing he does is expose what
14:39
evil is there
14:41
you can go back to the bible with the
14:43
old testament new testament that's
14:44
happened over and over again but people
14:46
who don't study the word like study i
14:49
know people read it but if you study the
14:51
word of god you would see and you look
14:54
for certain things
14:55
in the word then you would find out that
14:57
whenever something god is going to
15:00
happen the devil shows up to make people
15:03
believe it's a lie there's no way this
15:04
can happen i'm taking over you know you
15:07
won't have a chance you won't have a
15:08
life he's done that and not just in this
15:10
country the devil always does that and
15:12
that's what he's doing now only now you
15:14
know his little ploy was take the whole
15:16
world right now i'm going to push this
15:18
whole thing through i'm going to bring
15:20
the heat like satan could do it i'm
15:22
going to bring the perilous times and
15:23
the tribulation me and that's my big
15:25
time i have news for him the tribulation
15:27
won't be his big show it's going to be
15:29
the greatest downfall he'll ever have
15:31
ever for a thousand years after that
15:33
he'll be thrown in the bottomless pit i
15:35
would say that night would be a big show
15:36
for him
15:38
so even that's not if god's already got
15:40
that
15:41
and he knows what's going to happen at
15:43
the end of those few short years he does
15:45
have which is several hundred years away
15:47
i'm just going to keep saying it
15:49
um nobody knows the day but god god
15:51
hasn't told me today but he has told me
15:52
his generations and generations away
15:56
that's good you're sitting there in fear
15:58
that your children will have already
16:00
having a rough time but your
16:01
grandchildren your great grandchildren
16:03
what is it going to be about so bad then
16:04
they won't be able to live no this is
16:06
the opposite it'd be so great the
16:08
darkness won't be able to survive very
16:10
well or work very well because of the
16:12
power of god being operated in the earth
16:15
so yes um what was the question
16:18
well you did good on that uh let me ask
16:20
you this there was a time i don't
16:22
remember i have a suspicion that it
16:24
could be this time period but when god
16:27
first told you to declare let the show
16:29
begin
16:30
and then it's like the glacier on earth
16:32
i don't know if he used that term but
16:33
when did when did he declare that to you
16:35
and what was going on in the earth at
16:37
that time that was when
16:39
um the show began was right about the
16:42
time when well i'll have to say the t
16:44
word when those elections started the
16:47
first time okay
16:49
the first time it was probably when i
16:51
can go back and look because i actually
16:53
have someone that recorded
16:55
and it might be fun actually to release
16:57
those cds just so people can happen to
17:00
hear what god was saying because it
17:01
really didn't start stuff back then yeah
17:03
i didn't know
17:04
any of this was known god already knew
17:06
this stuff would happen but he knows how
17:09
it's going to end and what will happen
17:11
why is god allowing this so he can wipe
17:13
out the platform of evil that is right
17:16
now trying to control us
17:18
you can see people go well if this
17:20
wasn't here we'd all be doing fine oh no
17:23
don't use the word fine say powerful
17:26
because if evil wasn't present to
17:28
control your every word every movement
17:30
and dictate to you as a dictator what
17:32
you were going to do what you could have
17:33
what you couldn't have
17:35
you don't you you forgot sometimes i
17:37
think what freedom really is
17:39
but what's coming is the greatest
17:41
freedom we've ever had in this country
17:44
wow that's like everywhere and he did
17:47
say that i remember even the places i
17:49
was in uh if you go back and look at um
17:52
i think it's called
17:53
what's it called jen not activation
17:55
ministries anymore if you go back and
17:57
look at yourself
17:58
gateway i'm not zion and this was back
18:00
in 2014 i think probably 2014 2015
18:05
um was when he began to say let the show
18:08
begin
18:10
and also i was in uh also in missouri
18:12
saying that some people didn't want me
18:14
to say that they weren't sure you know
18:16
who would win in 2016.
18:18
and yet he did win in a landslide yeah
18:21
before that when god said let the show
18:23
begin
18:24
that show began actually in
18:28
2016 when those elections happened that
18:31
was the show beginning wow all that
18:34
you're in guess what
18:36
all of this going on right now i got to
18:38
just move the spirit
18:40
the holy spirit's going like this
18:43
drama king people yeah
18:45
drama he's ahead of this whole drama it
18:47
is a drama and you're all a part of it
18:50
so you know what you sit in the
18:51
sidelines and you cheer him on you cheer
18:54
on god the show has begun the show of
18:56
what it's like a big movie playing in
18:59
heaven because to them it's happened
19:02
of of god coming into this country
19:05
laying his hands on it turning it red
19:08
for righteousness and also for what is
19:10
right
19:11
yeah he's only touched it too late they
19:13
can't come in their little black evil
19:16
cells and and think i'm taking this and
19:18
here's the power of god in the life of
19:20
god laid in our country that's what
19:22
they're trying to walk on and run on and
19:24
let me tell you what there's going to be
19:25
some slipping and falling like you never
19:27
saw before because when it begins to
19:29
rise up out of the ground this is how
19:31
the spirit realm works when that begins
19:33
to rise up it got laid on our country
19:37
and he laid it down and like the
19:40
beginning of 2016
19:42
and he was telling me to say even louder
19:44
let the show begin that was his show
19:46
this is not satan's show wicked man show
19:49
this is god's show wow it's got comedy
19:53
it's got excitement it's got drama you
19:55
see all the drama it's got exposure in
19:58
it for the evil uh it is a big show and
20:01
it's not like it's a joke it's really
20:03
real i know that but if you saw god's
20:05
viewpoint
20:06
the show has begun and it isn't over and
20:10
guess what at the end is victory and
20:12
celebration so god talks a lot about
20:15
that's why i talk about victory and
20:16
celebration you know celebrate and eat
20:18
kate eat little pieces and i already
20:20
tell people we're gonna have a glory
20:21
diet when this is all over that's good
20:24
so when you've been to heaven multiple
20:26
times hundreds and hundreds of times
20:28
have you ever seen the lord rubbing his
20:30
hand saying man i don't know if this is
20:31
gonna work out
20:35
never once never
20:38
and i have i mean i have seen when i say
20:41
them that's the trinity okay
20:43
when i've seen them
20:45
they laugh a lot yeah i'm not laughing
20:49
at the devil good laughing at the devil
20:51
who thinks i have everything he's always
20:53
saying i got it now that's what the
20:55
devil says i got it now i got it i sort
20:57
of like i don't know whatever
20:59
but he hadn't got nothing but fair
21:01
because he is the biggest loser that
21:03
ever existed
21:04
i think he must have been branded with a
21:06
big l on his forehead that'd be
21:07
interesting to see that
21:09
because he thought listen if this person
21:11
is dumb i mean i don't use a word
21:13
lightly if he's stupid enough
21:16
no intelligence almost left in his
21:18
entire head who lives in heaven with the
21:22
trinity and thinks he's taking over
21:27
do you think he's numb enough and stupid
21:28
enough try to take over the earth i
21:30
would say yes he probably is he has not
21:32
any marbles left in his head whatsoever
21:34
um i think the demons play marbles with
21:36
him or something i'm not being funny i'm
21:38
being serious wow
21:40
because something happened when he was
21:42
kicked out of heaven part of his brain
21:44
did get seared by the lightning bolt you
21:46
can't be hit by a lightning bolt from
21:48
god lightning in heaven is blessings and
21:50
love he was kicked out of heaven with a
21:54
million megawatts of love on that
21:56
lightning bolt
21:57
and ever since then was planning and
21:59
planning to take this earth and now this
22:01
is what robin and i heard robin say a
22:03
little bit the other day that that satan
22:05
was making his move to try to push it
22:07
when he said push it push it ahead of
22:09
time right like perhaps time people it
22:12
lives in god it comes from god here's
22:14
the one you thought he was going to take
22:15
over kicked him out right he has no seat
22:17
there no power there whatsoever and the
22:19
only power he really has over us is what
22:21
we give him or allow him to take or we
22:24
participate with him those are our
22:26
family members let's go this is still
22:28
the show this is still the show's going
22:30
on
22:30
and now i'm telling you what the angels
22:32
are sitting watching except not the army
22:34
the army is extremely busy yeah to our
22:37
fam our family members who have gone
22:38
before uh we
22:40
you said many times about they they are
22:42
allowed to look down to portals to see
22:44
special events weddings and births and
22:47
parties and things like that whatever
22:49
god allows them to see
22:51
do they know about this stuff that's
22:53
going on on the earth at all or are they
22:55
kept from knowing this what what i'll
22:57
tell you what they've seen they've
22:58
already seen the show steve oh really
23:01
how so we've already seen the show many
23:03
times he will actually show them if
23:06
there's a movement going on in the earth
23:07
there's a time that's his time on there
23:09
she shows them the end already in heaven
23:12
so they're not up there going oh no
23:13
what's going to happen to them they're
23:15
up there celebrating and saying
23:18
you know like go holy spirit go god go
23:21
jesus
23:22
they've already seen the end of that
23:24
show that we're in right now
23:25
okay that's really good all right here's
23:28
a question i'm going to skip forward to
23:30
number five so if you're watching this
23:31
illumination she and i share the same
23:33
list
23:34
this kind of taps into what we're
23:36
talking about and then a woman named
23:38
debbie asked what's the difference
23:39
between the kingdom age which i think
23:41
the lord announced to you on uh 2012
23:45
and what's the difference between that
23:47
and the millennial age do you
23:49
can you describe it because they sound
23:52
similar like the kingdom age
23:54
and the millennial age people would
23:56
think those were the same things so
23:57
what's the difference no they're not the
23:59
kingdom age is where we actually we
24:03
as the body of christ operate in that
24:05
kingdom that christ always talked about
24:08
it is a spiritual kingdom you operate in
24:10
spiritual power and authority it's all
24:13
connected to heaven but it's our
24:15
operations on the earth so when jesus
24:18
takes over the millennial age it's a
24:20
whole new age and actually the kingdom
24:23
age goes all the way up
24:25
into the into the millennial age where
24:27
some people say are not it's not going
24:28
to happen well you need to go to heaven
24:30
and see god's timeline all right because
24:32
i do know what will happen
24:34
no this is us walking in power and
24:36
authority on the earth because of christ
24:38
with him uh changing and shifting all
24:41
kinds of things because he wants it done
24:44
and needs it done until the day when of
24:46
course that that battle happens at the
24:49
end of the kingdom age at the end of the
24:52
kingdom age which includes the perilous
24:55
times the tribulation at the end of that
24:57
time
24:58
when satan is bound and thrown in the
25:00
bottomless pit for a thousand years
25:01
christ takes the throne
25:03
in the city of jerusalem
25:06
in this natural world and rules
25:09
as king of this world
25:12
that's the millennial age so this is uh
25:14
walking power and authority the kingdom
25:16
age is a whole new time on the earth
25:18
because of the revelation we have an
25:20
understanding of who we are we will
25:22
begin to shift things for god and i'm
25:25
saying i'm not going to give the
25:26
fullness of that yet but we were walking
25:28
upon authority not having any fear of
25:30
the enemy crushing darkness pushing it
25:33
back operating with the army of heaven
25:35
it's our time to shine
25:37
it's hard time to do that for him at the
25:40
end of those days
25:42
will be the millennial age where christ
25:44
himself will be sitting on the throne he
25:47
won't need us to do that people
25:49
yeah and the 2012
25:51
am i right was that when god announced
25:53
the kingdom age 2012 yes yes we stepped
25:56
off a threshold of time and we stepped
25:58
into the kingdom age in 2012.
26:01
okay and i i told people on this show
26:03
before
26:04
my uh
26:05
spiritual father way taylor who's gone
26:07
home to me with the lord was telling me
26:09
that in 2012 that we had entered the
26:11
kingdom age and i thought where is he
26:13
getting that you know well he obviously
26:15
received it from the lord he's been
26:16
caught up in heaven himself
26:19
so he said that and there was a uh older
26:21
man who's now gone to be with the lord
26:23
arthur burt
26:25
there's a arthur burke with the k arthur
26:27
who's the older one he began to prophesy
26:30
this in 2012 that the he talked about
26:32
the
26:34
the flaw of the spirit that would not
26:35
even ab again or something and he
26:37
probably was 2012. so there are multiple
26:40
people you're not the only one in other
26:41
words that got that this is when we
26:43
entered the because i have you you're
26:45
wrong
26:45
people in africa someone in africa wrote
26:48
a book
26:49
saying it's the kingdom age and they
26:51
didn't fully understand what that meant
26:53
they weren't shown into the future the
26:55
kingdom age they knew god was saying
26:57
that and that was also in 2012 i didn't
27:00
even know about them so i had gone to
27:02
the middle of america and declared this
27:04
for god that we have stepped because he
27:06
was telling me to do that so i did that
27:09
we're in the kingdom age right now
27:10
people which means we will understand
27:13
fully what christ meant when he talked
27:14
about the kingdom the gospel of the
27:16
kingdom
27:17
he was talking about the gospel but
27:19
there's a whole kingdom that comes with
27:20
that that's your power that's your
27:22
authority that's your dominion because
27:24
of belonging to him you have you operate
27:27
in that kingdom and you're over the
27:29
darkness
27:31
so all this exposure of darkness has
27:33
everything to do with that there's
27:35
different things he will have god will
27:36
have happened in the kingdom age first
27:39
one understanding you're in a new time
27:41
and then he sets a new person in place
27:43
who will begin to bring the greatness
27:45
here and then even though there's a
27:47
disruption god knows all this and then
27:49
he he had you know
27:52
that people were understanding there is
27:53
great darkness in the earth because
27:55
before most people were ignoring it
27:58
we were sound asleep we thought
28:01
you were sounded asleep let me tell you
28:03
yeah we were sound asleep we didn't know
28:06
that the child trafficking was actually
28:08
going on that the human trafficking was
28:10
going we didn't we we literally because
28:13
and whenever we brought up people would
28:15
say that sounds like a big conspiracy
28:17
theory there's no such thing
28:19
no it was not a conspiracy theory yeah
28:22
wow i mean that's huge in this year that
28:25
we're in 2021
28:27
i think more people in the body of
28:29
christ have awakened than have ever
28:31
awakened i don't know if they're fully
28:32
awake i don't know if we're we're fully
28:34
awake yet in fact i want to segue into
28:37
this question regarding cocaine we're in
28:39
the kingdom it's getting intense now the
28:41
lord already knows what's going to
28:43
happen it's already done in his
28:45
so are there things i'm not asking you
28:47
to tell me what you shouldn't tell me
28:49
but are there things that the lord has
28:51
told you about the kingdom age that
28:53
you're not supposed to release yet and
28:56
maybe what are those type of they're not
28:58
saying tell me if you're not supposed to
29:00
but what are the why would you why would
29:01
he give you stuff to say no don't
29:03
release this yet
29:05
oh i do know this that the revelation
29:07
that he has given that we will operate
29:10
in will totally change everyone's life
29:12
yet he said it will change the way the
29:14
body of christ operates
29:16
so it's much more major than just an
29:18
individual life being changed during
29:20
these days uh it's not just waking you
29:23
up this is what he said you need to wake
29:25
up stand up and stand out so that's
29:28
what's coming
29:29
that's what he wants they need to wake
29:31
up but they need to stand up that means
29:33
stand up and say stuff and then when you
29:35
stand out that's you operating in the
29:38
power of god so he's letting me tell you
29:40
that much he always has like a process
29:42
or a wave a protocol that he does things
29:45
god is not without protocol and planning
29:48
okay he does do that probably more than
29:50
anyone so the whole
29:52
plan for this is happening now
29:54
is for people to wake up and go wow
29:56
there really is evil there's wickedness
29:58
and it does want to take over and and
30:01
he's showing people this is what people
30:03
would live like in some foreign
30:05
countries they do live like this they
30:07
have nothing it's often taken away
30:09
they're controlled
30:10
they own nothing that is the plot of
30:13
satan being worked out by man by wicked
30:16
man
30:17
satan can't take a throne right now
30:19
himself and do what he'd like to do he
30:22
can't do that so he's still using humans
30:24
to do his dirty work that's all i can
30:27
call it he's using humans who
30:29
participate
30:30
and say oh yes i want this i'll make
30:32
money i'll be hell have power and he'll
30:35
make them even feel powerful i'm talking
30:36
about satan but he has no real power as
30:40
far as god is concerned and he shouldn't
30:42
have any power over us at all so what's
30:46
going to happen is when god begins to do
30:49
certain things
30:50
you begin to not just wake up you're
30:52
going to stand up and start saying stuff
30:54
like i'm talking about taking authority
30:56
declaring things to happen in the
30:58
atmosphere and places in the earth
31:00
that's what you should be doing it's
31:02
wonderful to know god is here and yes he
31:04
is he he is in control he owns all of
31:07
this but he wants you as his
31:09
representative as his son or his
31:11
daughter not something else in between
31:14
uh taking authority that you have a
31:16
right to take because of christ
31:18
and so what's coming next is the
31:20
stand-up thing many people are waking up
31:23
they don't know what to do i'm talking
31:24
about believers right now right right
31:27
dude they don't know what to say you
31:28
know should i say be quiet or say
31:30
nothing your voice power in it you have
31:33
such power in the spirit realm because
31:35
you have to remember you see with your
31:37
human eyes right the physical realm you
31:40
don't see unless you're a seer the
31:42
spiritual realm when you say something
31:44
what happens in the spiritual realm is
31:47
satan's plans begin to get crushed
31:50
from the spiritual side
31:52
when they begin to get crushed by things
31:55
you're declaring and taking authority
31:56
over that power is taken away from the
31:59
humans who are operating in wickedness
32:01
this is why it's so important to
32:02
understand who you are that's what
32:04
spirit forces which is why i'm not gonna
32:07
say everything yet but i'm telling you
32:09
you will fully understand
32:11
that's the stand up part but the
32:13
standout part is really those words so
32:16
stay wake up stand up and stand out
32:19
that's god's plan for us in this time
32:23
wake up realize this stuff has really
32:24
happened it's really going on but you
32:26
shouldn't have fear if you're a believer
32:28
you have authority over it where in the
32:31
kingdom
32:32
in the kingdom of age
32:34
so this all going to flow together and
32:36
you know what it'll be almost like
32:37
breathing one day steve when they wake
32:39
up they're already declaring and saying
32:41
things they're stopping things in the
32:43
natural because of what they're saying
32:44
in the spirit realm that's good that's
32:46
how it's going to happen
32:48
so wake up stand up many are starting to
32:51
stand up they're actually saying things
32:52
against what's going on and i'm not just
32:55
talking about taking things to court
32:56
going to the media who will listen but
32:59
i'm saying they really begin to stand up
33:00
and where they live and say things that
33:02
they're not agreeing with it that this
33:04
is not god god's got great plans it's
33:06
important to say god's plans so
33:08
important if you hear a bad report
33:10
always give a good report
33:12
you have to give a good report from god
33:14
god has us under control we're working
33:16
with him we're going to see his hand
33:18
move for us but we have to stand up and
33:20
be on his side and we have to say we're
33:22
on his side okay it makes the difference
33:25
in the spirit realm around you
33:27
and what's in your own soul is very
33:29
important so the stand up part
33:32
is recognizing in your own soul man this
33:34
just been flooding in i'm getting all
33:35
this negative stuff out and ask god to
33:38
put stuff in you can say god i i choose
33:40
my will to bind to my soul your love
33:43
your authority the dominion
33:46
your will your way
33:48
what i have in christ when you say those
33:50
things he'll flood your soul with that
33:52
which will kind of wipe out which is
33:54
part of the dust thing if you come like
33:55
that
33:56
it begins to minimize the impact in your
33:59
soul and the way you think of what you
34:01
choose because to minimize that when you
34:03
ask and bind the things of god to your
34:05
soul yeah let me ask this about you
34:08
until this whole wake up season in these
34:11
last few years
34:12
i've always been taught that when things
34:14
are wrapping up it'll get worse and
34:16
worse one world government
34:18
elites globalists will appear and they
34:21
will begin to try and take control and
34:23
now we're in the midst of the kingdom
34:25
age and you're saying it's not
34:27
that time yet
34:29
so but we know right now cat that
34:31
there's elites out there i'll just use
34:32
the word elites or globalists they would
34:35
rather just control everything and make
34:37
the rest of us you know serfs and slaves
34:40
and whatever
34:41
so is god telling you during this
34:43
kingdom age that whole
34:46
elite thing is going to get
34:48
tamped down destroyed wiped out or just
34:51
less influential what what are we
34:53
expecting god to do with these globalist
34:56
elites who are trying to control us
34:59
i know that some of them well this is
35:01
what he said lose their power
35:03
lose their money and lose their voice
35:07
okay
35:08
and you know
35:10
and and you don't know if it's you're
35:12
not saying if it's
35:14
because here's what i'm one of the
35:15
reasons it's in my mind is when i've
35:17
when i'm asking this question you said
35:19
before there's going to come a time when
35:21
if you want to sin you're going to have
35:22
to go to a city where that's
35:25
uh probably because
35:26
there'll be righteous cities where
35:28
there's just almost no sin if i am i
35:30
saying that about right
35:32
there's yes there will be glories of uh
35:35
realms of glory
35:37
cities of glory regions of light it's
35:39
called regions of light steve and
35:41
regions of darkness that's what god
35:42
called okay regions of light will
35:44
overwhelm the regions of darkness in
35:47
other words there'll be more regions of
35:48
light
35:50
where people will go to live in because
35:51
of the presence of god
35:53
sickness this is god there'll be no
35:55
sickness in those cities
35:57
wow wow that's so this is why this is
36:00
why this all has to happen
36:04
it has to happen so we understand you
36:06
have to see the division there's so much
36:08
gray and god says gray is where people
36:10
don't know or don't care
36:12
there is an area even in the spirit
36:14
realm there's those who are in the
36:16
darkness those who are in the light
36:18
and then in the middle is a gray area
36:20
where people can't make the decision or
36:21
their play back and forth in the camp
36:23
because the camp of darkness came from
36:25
the enemy or his camp the camp of
36:27
righteousness is the camp of light so
36:29
there's regions of light
36:31
okay and regions of darkness you'll have
36:34
to live in the regions of darkness
36:37
do evil i mean the crime will be
36:39
outrageous but there will be almost no
36:41
nothing that is counted as illegal in
36:43
the regions of darkness wow they can do
36:45
any kind of perverted awful horrible
36:47
thing
36:48
because it'll be pushed back
36:51
when i said god said crush it and push
36:53
it back
36:54
that's what will be happening in the
36:56
spirit realm
36:57
crush uh the enemy out of whole regions
37:00
and push them back until they won't be
37:03
able to just go into some they won't
37:04
want to go i say better i'll say it
37:06
better holy spirit yeah they don't want
37:08
to go into the regions of light it'll be
37:11
so painful for the demons to go into a
37:13
region of light they won't be able to
37:15
function yeah and what you're describing
37:18
huh well what you're describing yeah i'm
37:21
really focusing on these regions of
37:22
light because i'm saying gee is is the
37:24
lord saying to his believers his kids of
37:28
you know children of god is he saying
37:30
look
37:31
i'm giving you all of these righteous
37:33
cities throughout the earth or
37:34
throughout the united states live in any
37:36
one of them that you want and you will
37:37
prosper and you'll you will be no
37:39
sickness is that what
37:41
or will some people some people it
37:43
doesn't sound like your people are being
37:45
called into regions of darkness to
37:47
evangelize them but maybe that's maybe
37:49
that's just my
37:50
i think that would have to be a very
37:52
special people
37:54
that have very special people
37:56
um the why for the reasons of life is to
37:59
magnify god's power and glory
38:02
and i can tell you when it spreads it
38:04
says it will be known around the world
38:07
if there's only one way that happens
38:09
it's not going to necessarily just but
38:10
by spoken word it's going to be by the
38:12
activities
38:13
of the saints of god and i love to say
38:15
the saints of god because people are
38:16
already bashing you know
38:18
nicholas and saint whoever don't you
38:21
know in the bible we're called saints
38:22
that's right is that true stephen that
38:24
is true that's right to the same welcome
38:27
person
38:28
if you belong to jesus christ you are
38:30
the saints of god this is not what this
38:32
whole thing is about but i just couldn't
38:33
help but put that little
38:35
thing out there well you know it's just
38:37
so well so you're saying that it would
38:40
be the right thing for christians to
38:42
find
38:43
regions of light and just move there
38:45
well i think it's going to be created by
38:47
the saints
38:49
okay okay the glory when these these
38:51
waves of glory will come
38:54
to consume us you have to understand i
38:56
don't we don't have time even in this
38:58
short segment to explain it all i mean i
39:00
know robin knows so much he tries to but
39:03
he can do one after the other you know
39:04
we do it once a week and that's great
39:07
because god wants people to be focused
39:09
on that and again i have to thank you
39:11
and i'm still going to say people you
39:13
need to give to elijah a list of
39:15
elijah's streams because you would not
39:18
be getting this broadcast you would not
39:20
be getting powerful revelation and it's
39:22
nice to have head knowledge about the
39:24
word and head knowledge what people
39:26
researched and looked up and seen but
39:28
revelation comes from the heart of god
39:30
it doesn't come from me at all okay the
39:33
12th grade education
39:35
that doesn't come from me i can't make
39:36
it up i can't even think it up the
39:38
things that god says revelation is one
39:40
of the most important things you will
39:41
get that's when it says man does not
39:44
live by bread alone but by every word
39:47
spoken by the mouth of god that's
39:49
revelation he speaks and his prophets
39:52
speak it but sometimes other people in
39:54
the five full ministry sometimes
39:55
everyday people will get revelation
39:57
but the regions of light and darkness
39:59
they won't happen overnight just so you
40:01
know that
40:03
there are some things that actually will
40:04
be a suddenly and begin to change right
40:07
away
40:08
in this next year it's going to start to
40:09
change right away but what will build
40:11
he's building on
40:13
is he will have regions of light and i
40:16
was shown those regions of light that's
40:18
why i can talk about it i saw this whole
40:20
city the light coming from it was
40:22
amazing and thinking god you're really
40:24
in that city this was in the future he
40:26
was taking me he took me there
40:28
and i and he said those that's coming
40:30
from the saints of god who live there
40:33
that's my light in them
40:35
operating and living there permeating
40:38
every structure the ground the
40:40
atmosphere
40:41
and he showed me a line of cars coming
40:44
down 95 who had they had sick people in
40:47
their cars or even dead people in their
40:49
cars and i don't do this right now
40:51
and they were coming to a region of
40:52
light when they pulled over the line
40:55
that was the boundaries of that city the
40:57
people came to life i'm not making it up
41:00
they were healed instantly or they came
41:02
to life
41:03
where's 95 by where is this that you're
41:05
describing is that
41:06
95 runs up the entire east coast all the
41:09
way from the furthest north all the way
41:11
down to miami the i-95 interstate 95 wow
41:15
wow and i saw cars backed up so far and
41:18
they were bringing people to a region of
41:21
light that's incredible where god was
41:24
because they gave themselves to god they
41:27
had no sin in their life and so stop
41:29
telling me you can't sin
41:31
and stop making excuses by saying we've
41:33
all sinned and come short of the glory
41:35
might as well keep sinning well you know
41:37
what you know what you forgot the last
41:38
part of that sentence what is the sin
41:40
he's talking about
41:42
all have sinned
41:44
and come short of the glory of god
41:47
that's what he's talking about you're
41:48
talking about being an old sinner and
41:50
just sinning all day long he's not
41:51
talking about that right he's talking
41:53
about the glory have you made any
41:55
creativity for him have you used your
41:57
life to bring glory to of god in this
42:00
earth
42:01
that's going to change
42:04
because we'll know him so well and be in
42:06
his presence so much
42:08
and be used by him because we said yes
42:11
to use us you can say yes i want to be a
42:13
believer and repent to jesus and get
42:15
saved but if you want more you go after
42:17
that more
42:18
you go after the more but what is coming
42:21
in this country i know i saw it there
42:23
will be one day regions of light where
42:26
people will go to be in that presence of
42:28
god they'll be consumed by the presence
42:30
of god
42:31
if they want to sin they'll have to
42:33
leave
42:34
yeah so when you think there's not going
42:35
to be a change we are not going further
42:37
into darkness right now it's being
42:39
exposed god said what is exposed can be
42:42
taken
42:42
down yeah
42:46
so he's so you're so all of these wicked
42:48
things that we're having is not people's
42:51
eyes being open so they can see how far
42:53
we are now going downhill it's not that
42:56
he's exposing this so people can stop
43:00
the evil cooperate with god is that what
43:02
you're saying yes you need to choose
43:04
what god if you're a believer i'm
43:06
talking to believe okay the world the
43:08
secular world
43:09
is going to be influenced by whoever you
43:11
know i'm sure they're there's some let
43:13
me tell you this i have to say this
43:15
there's more
43:16
right now living in this country against
43:19
the darkness
43:20
whether the believers or a secular world
43:23
are good moral people they're not
43:25
necessary believers they need to become
43:27
believers but they don't want what's
43:29
being dished out to us that's good
43:32
probably close to 80 million are against
43:35
all of it which is the majority of this
43:37
country but the other side it can't sink
43:40
in their own minds are seared
43:43
it talks about your mind being seared
43:44
you can't think normal so those who have
43:46
said yes to the wickedness and evil they
43:48
can only think that they can't even
43:51
think what is good that's why they can't
43:52
plan anything good why can't they play
43:54
any good there's only darkness in them
43:57
so god is exposing to you all of you it
44:00
is present this is how satan operates he
44:03
comes in in certain ways to try to take
44:04
what he wants he'll always find people
44:07
somewhere he did way back in the days of
44:08
noah and ever since then he can always
44:10
talk people into doing wicked things if
44:12
they if they have greed in them and have
44:15
anger or hate or whatever he will go
44:18
after those people to use them to be
44:20
leaders but we who are already in the
44:23
light who are filled with christ can
44:24
speak against those things i'm not
44:26
saying you have to go to the doorstep
44:28
and do it either but you shouldn't just
44:29
be repeating the horrible things as
44:32
being said by those people you should be
44:34
saying what god says he's exposing the
44:37
darkness it will be taken down he will
44:40
clean a platform so that we can operate
44:42
freely in these days of glory coming on
44:46
the earth he already put part of the
44:48
glory in the foundation in the very
44:50
ground you put his hand on it and put it
44:52
in there so when it comes from above and
44:54
beneath guest is going to get caught in
44:55
that smack i can tell you he's got
44:58
powerful plans he's not ignoring us he
45:01
is working out his plan and there will
45:03
be nobody escape
45:06
there's been a part of all that kind of
45:07
controlling they won't escape
45:10
and he assures me of that all the time
45:13
justice has actually already been sent
45:15
he's just waiting to release it and
45:18
that's interesting can you elaborate
45:19
that a little bit more you said it's
45:21
been sent
45:22
so it's here
45:24
but he's not
45:26
um initiating it somehow he's not
45:28
anytime
45:30
god will send things many times ahead of
45:32
the time it's activated
45:35
and it's waiting
45:37
so you can't see
45:39
those who are waiting to do something
45:41
because these are spiritual things
45:44
okay but i can tell you the spiritual
45:46
realm is the main realm it's the primary
45:49
realm not the physical realm
45:51
yeah the super the spirit realm
45:52
supersedes it was here before it'll be
45:56
here after this physical realm so in
45:58
that spirit realm with how god operates
46:00
but he uses physical
46:02
being here just a minute yeah go ahead
46:04
and get it while you're taking that and
46:06
um well i don't want to interrupt that
46:08
thought so go ahead
46:10
he uses us to carry out things he wants
46:13
done on the earth
46:15
so if everybody starts citing oh listen
46:17
all i can listen to stop listening to
46:19
the bad stuff people
46:21
i'm not saying ignore it i'm saying say
46:23
something against it yeah i get up in
46:26
the morning i begin to declare the day i
46:28
declare the day i take authority every
46:30
day
46:31
over anything trying to interfere in my
46:33
life to kill steal or destroy to attack
46:36
me in any way to take things from me
46:38
that are mine i command the host to pull
46:40
down strongholds that's what strongholds
46:42
do they build their self around you to
46:44
do something against you
46:46
but he's given that the army of having
46:48
to pull them down you can't see him you
46:50
can't walk up and take something in your
46:52
hand so some people think it's not real
46:54
it's more real than you are it was here
46:56
before you were
46:59
wow wow
47:02
go ahead go ahead and finish that well
47:04
he really is right now waking up
47:07
not just so you'll be awake and be aware
47:10
it's so you then stand up
47:12
and start speaking against it
47:15
in your own life if every believer just
47:17
started speaking in their own
47:18
neighborhood i'm not the darkness in the
47:20
evil flooding my neighborhood i'm not
47:22
agreeing with any evil takeover i'm not
47:24
gonna i'm not tolerating it in any way
47:26
in jesus name you have left you have
47:29
like loosed bombs in the spirit realm
47:31
against the darkness
47:33
yeah
47:34
and every evil person on the earth no
47:36
matter who they are i mean there's a
47:37
list of names i can't give you but if
47:40
you if you spoke against the evil
47:42
controlling them
47:44
their power they've been operating and
47:46
will be stripped away
47:48
man left on their own has fear that's
47:51
what they live in if they're in darkness
47:53
and the power that's been given to them
47:55
through satan or to operate in or demons
47:58
around them to do that is stripped away
48:00
this is what comes fear and confusion
48:03
that's why you're going to see more and
48:05
more of those people fall upon each
48:07
other tell on each other that's a good
48:10
sign that that foundation that god
48:12
talked about is crumbling you cannot
48:13
have a foundation of evil it never
48:16
stands it won't even stand in the day of
48:19
tribulation because no matter how bad
48:20
satan wants everybody he's never going
48:23
to get them and he isn't going to win
48:25
now that's the main thing you have to
48:26
remember god is not there just twiddling
48:29
his thumbs he already had plans for all
48:32
of this
48:33
i'm not tolerating evil around me i'm
48:36
not participating with it in any way
48:38
whatsoever by gossiping about the bad
48:40
things going on i
48:43
i shoot darts into the heart of the
48:45
enemy that would be satan and all his
48:47
demons when i say i'm not tolerating the
48:49
darkness i have power over i'm speaking
48:52
against all these things have been said
48:54
that we have to do in the spirit realm i
48:56
want them to become like dust
48:58
now can there's people
49:00
something
49:01
there's people we know who are evil you
49:03
said you talked about there's a list and
49:04
most of us could name nine or ten off
49:06
the top of our head who we know they're
49:07
doing evil they're everybody knows it
49:10
they know their name they know what
49:11
they're they've been up they know how
49:12
famous they are for their evil now
49:14
so if i know let's just say i take five
49:17
or six of those who i know who i believe
49:19
are the most evil
49:21
tell me how i should decree
49:24
without getting in trouble with god
49:26
because we're not supposed to
49:28
wish anyone to go to hell because god
49:30
doesn't wish anyone to hell so how would
49:33
we fight against what those specific
49:35
people are doing without praying a miss
49:38
or without decreeing wrongly
49:40
it's what is what they're operating in
49:42
my scarf's
49:44
it's
49:45
they operate because they have given
49:47
themselves to the evil okay and a lot of
49:50
them know they've done that and don't
49:51
care they're benefiting from it some
49:54
actually have had promises from evil
49:56
beings that they will be promoted in
49:58
satan's kingdom which is a joke they'll
50:01
be promoted they'll be honored they'll
50:02
have more than anyone else this is what
50:04
they get they get tormented more than
50:06
anyone else in hell and satan laughs at
50:08
them i'm talking about the highest
50:10
people involved in all this he will
50:12
laugh at them and he will have them and
50:14
he will take them to hell when they die
50:15
that's what will happen to them that is
50:17
their end and they can't change that end
50:20
only by confessing to jesus christ and
50:23
asking him to forgive will they not go
50:26
there because you cannot commit that
50:27
much evil against human flesh against
50:30
babies against god's own against god's
50:33
own
50:34
and not think you're going to pay a
50:35
profit so how do i
50:36

52:59
it through you or i heard it from some
53:01
other prophetic person who said that
53:03
they saw a couple regions that they even
53:05
named that had god had one day turned
53:08
them into like a region of light one of
53:10
those that i heard mentioned again i
53:11
don't remember who it was said that they
53:13
saw las vegas as dedicated to the lord
53:16
is that you that was yes it was
53:19
wow
53:22
i was actually in las vegas i've been
53:24
there like what three or four times
53:27
uh i was invited to speak in las vegas i
53:29
was speaking in reno on a yearly basis
53:32
and first of january i was invited to
53:34
speak out all the time and i would see a
53:36
lot of of course when in las vegas so
53:38
let's talk about las vegas when i was in
53:40
las vegas the first time i went i saw
53:42
uh demon serpents wrapped around some of
53:45
these great big old hotels that had
53:48
gambling and let me tell you the thing
53:50
why another thing that man is
53:51
pornography and prostitution is legal
53:55
yeah it's legal and they follow you
53:57
around and give you up these packets
53:59
these groups that's what they do for a
54:01
living they go around to give it to
54:02
different people and it tells you how to
54:04
connect with
54:06
very defiled defiled places that are
54:08
already there so i saw unclean spirits i
54:11
saw spirits of witchcraft i just tell
54:13
you witchcraft i saw a wickedness in
54:16
high places and these platforms you hear
54:18
me talk about it's what it is it's a
54:20
platform in the spirit realm and these
54:22
demons sit on them and give orders to
54:24
the other demons
54:26
who to mark who to go after because of
54:28
things that they're doing in that you
54:30
know they call that the city of sin
54:31
right
54:32
[Music]
54:33
in the midst of walking down the
54:35
sidewalks and i would every now and then
54:37
say something against something i saw
54:39
the holy spirit would say something
54:40
against us so i'd take authority over it
54:42
and cast it out of that and it would it
54:44
would have to leave it would scream and
54:45
leave it would scream like it was on
54:47
fire or i would just say fire fire of
54:50
god and they would all run and scatter
54:52
they were with these groups of people
54:53
walking around so these are people had
54:55
demons with them that were were working
54:57
in defilement to defile people
55:00
uh and they paid for the department
55:03
but these other big buildings i saw some
55:05
weren't hotels some are places that
55:08
wicked people go to operate from they
55:10
have operations there that are secret
55:12
operations that are wicked and evil and
55:14
i saw them and these like snakes were
55:16
coming in and out of these buildings
55:18
like poking his stuff in there and
55:20
delivering stuff and coming back
55:22
and he said
55:23
those buildings that you're going right
55:25
now i will take my hand one day and i'll
55:27
go shh when he did that every one of
55:30
them were gone every man on every
55:32
building gone wow
55:35
he said and i will put my mark on those
55:37
buildings i would begin to see the mark
55:39
of god either his own personal star
55:41
which we call the star of david was
55:43
actually put on these buildings there
55:46
there was a cross on some of these
55:47
buildings stopped saying the cross is
55:49
irrelevant
55:50
you're throwing away your whole
55:51
salvation you need to know that they
55:53
have crosses in heaven number one jesus
55:54
christ is a carpenter that's his mark
55:57
i bet it's important to him he died on
55:59
one okay anyway i began to see the light
56:02
of god
56:03
come first
56:05
because i talked about it from the
56:06
ground up and began to consume these
56:10
buildings and then all the lower level
56:12
demons who'd been on assignment were
56:15
running screaming like dust out of this
56:18
city
56:19
and god said one day this will be called
56:21
the city of his son
56:24
it will no longer be the city of sin i
56:27
have a market for myself so las vegas
56:30
is gonna be god
56:33
if you think you can't affect your city
56:35
i don't think they're as bad as that
56:36
place okay the stuff that goes on that's
56:39
actually been legalized by people who
56:42
allow it to be legalized when when
56:44
humans give permission
56:46
that's why some areas are darker than
56:48
others they're there in authority giving
56:50
permission for that to happen
56:52
and i don't need to say anything about
56:54
what's going on in other places right
56:55
now they're giving permission but you
56:58
have a voice yourself as a believer you
57:01
have more power in one little finger
57:03
than all these wicked people do because
57:04
you believe in the one who owns it all
57:07
who made it all okay you need to find
57:09
out from jesus christ what he wants for
57:12
you what is your point where's your
57:14
partner
57:15
and all this i know this is to always
57:17
speak life and light to people of course
57:19
you always declare that people will not
57:22
leave this earth until they've known
57:24
jesus christ as their savior you allowed
57:26
you're allowed to offer that
57:29
but there are some
57:30
there are some right now that will not
57:32
have mercy and god has told me i will
57:34
not give them mercy they've gone beyond
57:36
what they know that is so defiled and so
57:40
filled with the darkness and the evil if
57:42
i don't wipe it out it will continue
57:44
okay wow
57:45
yeah
57:46
yeah and you know i've asked you that
57:48
question too about that mercy part and i
57:50
if i believe that you
57:52
that i'm being correct when i say
57:55
usually the lord has shown him when
57:57
someone has become that well known for
57:59
their iniquitous ways they're
58:02
by and large gone they've by and large
58:05
given themselves over is that kind of
58:07
what you're saying
58:09
some of them have some of them don't
58:11
care when they begin to not care about
58:13
life itself yeah not any form of life
58:16
they don't care what they do that is so
58:17
wicked and evil they don't care who dies
58:20
they don't care if they kill everybody
58:21
and because if you give yourself to
58:23
satan satan wants everyone to die i mean
58:25
he wants everybody off this earth he
58:26
wants to take over with his own regions
58:28
of demons that's what he wants but he
58:31
can't do that he doesn't have the
58:33
authority or the power to do it he has
58:35
to use mankind well apparently there's
58:38
enough wicked people now who've been
58:40
placed in different places that that can
58:43
say things to make things happen for the
58:45
devil but you know what
58:47
there he's not god
58:49
he is not god
58:51
okay satan is not god people he was
58:54
created
58:55
as lucifer by god sin and evil was found
58:59
in him by the way god did not create sin
59:01
i need to clear that up he one of his
59:03
accusations bought against him by god
59:06
was uh iniquity was found in him that
59:09
sin wicked evil sin it was found in he
59:13
himself desired and that's why that's
59:16
the only thing he can say is his nothing
59:18
else that was made was made by him god
59:21
made everything in this earth how we use
59:23
it or what we do with it that's our
59:25
decision it's our decision
59:27
but there would be a day when evil that
59:30
person called evil satan will not be on
59:33
the earth they'll still be angry people
59:36
angry leaders in countries who haven't
59:38
received god when that tribulation does
59:40
end there's going to be people on the
59:42
earth that haven't accepted christ
59:44
they're just going to be the people who
59:46
will survive it although people always
59:47
show in movies they've nobody survived
59:49
well who is christ going to rule over on
59:51
his throne yeah and it does talk about
59:54
those people and some of them will be
59:55
kings and he said they won't want to
59:57
bring what they have before him he'll
59:58
say i won't send rain on your land
60:00
because they'll be wicked evil people
60:02
so yes he jesus christ is still going to
60:05
have a say in this earth especially
60:07
sitting on the throne in the millennial
60:08
reign it will happen it's after the
60:10
kingdom age comes that millennial age
60:13
but right now it is a decision ground
60:15
and i hear more people who don't know
60:16
what time it is they say you have to
60:18
make a decision now for christ well
60:20
everybody should every day is a good day
60:22
to receive christ and start operating
60:24
with him instead of giving yourself to
60:26
the other side which is you're never
60:28
going to win on that side but there will
60:30
be regions of light where people will
60:32
sickness will not be able to abide not
60:34
even crime can take place in those
60:36
regions
60:37
wow wouldn't that be no crime no
60:39
sickness uh it's gonna be a little bit
60:42
like heaven on earth i was gonna say
60:43
that it sounds a little bit like heaven
60:45
it's like a pre it's like one of the
60:48
the single most beautiful place and
60:51
situation you would have ever have lived
60:53
in up to that point any human being
60:55
right this side of heaven
60:57
yes that is absolutely true and the
60:59
miraculous will be happening everywhere
61:02
i i like to say this about the
61:03
miraculous it will you'll never become
61:05
familiar
61:06
every time you see a miracle of god a
61:08
suddenly of god
61:10
god given you you know his goodness or
61:12
moving his hand on your behalf you never
61:16
become familiar you're overwhelmed every
61:18
time by his love by his patience with us
61:22
he is long-suffering and i think i
61:24
mentioned this the last time the reason
61:26
why noah had to take 120 years to build
61:28
the ark wasn't because god was trying to
61:29
make noah work
61:31
he offered out of the long suffering of
61:34
god's own lobby allah 120 years for
61:36
anyone to repent that was there
61:38
they would have been on the ark
61:41
so all those wicked people had 120 years
61:43
to tell god
61:45
they were repent for their evil ways
61:47
they wanted to know him they could have
61:49
been on that ark so it was their own
61:52
fault their own a hardheartedness that
61:55
they didn't god didn't need 120 years
61:57
from noah to build the ark he wanted to
61:59
give 120 years for all the evil wicked
62:00
so yes he is long suffering he does want
62:02
to extend his mercy but we
62:05
we have a choice to make with our own
62:07
will
62:08
and right now god wants you to stand up
62:10
with your own and start declaring
62:12
against any evil present that you're not
62:14
tolerating it i serve only the most high
62:17
god i don't serve the darkness i will
62:19
not tolerate the darkness you just say
62:21
that in your own home you're releasing
62:23
stuff in the atmosphere that god can
62:24
actually use against that physical
62:26
darkness that's trying to take over this
62:28
world so i'm not ignoring anything and i
62:31
am not ignorant and very well informed
62:34
by the god who made this world but i
62:37
also know he has a timeline and this is
62:39
not the end it may be the end of many
62:42
wicked people
62:44
but i do ask for mercy you have to add
62:46
that mercy for those who were sucked
62:48
into it forced into it threatened into
62:51
it and they don't want it god make a way
62:53
for them to get out of that in jesus
62:55
name yeah for those i suppose that god
62:58
would seem to have even more mercy if
63:00
they were literally from birth
63:01
victimized sacrificed over and all that
63:04
they didn't even have a choice
63:07
i can imagine the lord giving them extra
63:09
you know attention to make sure they had
63:11
the choice that was never given to them
63:13
so wow wow
63:15
well cat you know i think you know we
63:16
could go on and on i have a list of
63:18
questions but i don't want to tamp down
63:20
anything you've already said i don't i
63:22
feel glad to just ask you if you would
63:24
just pray for the people who are just
63:26
what i'm hearing is a lot of people
63:27
saying this is so
63:29
encouraging why doesn't anybody speak or
63:32
why don't more people speak about the
63:34
encouragement that's ahead of us so
63:35
maybe just pray for those people and
63:38
whatever god fills
63:39
your heart with
63:41
yeah father i thank you for this
63:42
beautiful day that you have made no man
63:45
has made this day no man holds the air
63:48
we breathe no man really says what can
63:51
happen what cannot happen only you alone
63:54
sitting on your throne you have the
63:55
right to say that you in the word made
63:58
this world you made everything ever
63:59
existed your son came and died because
64:02
you asked him to if you think people
64:04
that there is not mercy why did he come
64:06
to die he didn't have to he he agreed to
64:09
do that but he wasted hell on the third
64:12
day he took authority walking as a
64:15
righteous man he was the son of god he's
64:17
also called the son of man he walked
64:19
righteously on the earth hell could not
64:23
hold him
64:24
so it should not be able to hold you
64:27
force you put fear in you you need to
64:31
stand up and start saying i'm not
64:33
tolerating the darkness i'm not
64:34
tolerating the evil around me anymore
64:36
open your front door and kick it out and
64:39
then you say i invite god the god that
64:41
created all things his son jesus christ
64:43
i invite holy spirit to consume this
64:45
property consume our home and then you
64:48
begin to build a habitation for heaven
64:50
which is what we all need around us god
64:53
i speak against anyone trying to control
64:55
hurt a maim or steal people's identities
64:59

67:01
him more things to declare and decree
67:04

think there's testimonies on there and
67:08
it's the one place on planet earth that
67:10
you can give to me online if anybody
67:13
else if you see me on other places
67:15
there's a lot of fake facebooks and
67:16
youtubes out there but i will not ever
67:19
stand here or sit here and say i'm
67:20
asking you for money i won't do that i
67:23
won't say there's some group over here
67:24
you need to give to those are just plots
67:26
to get your money but you can go to
67:28
catcure.com and click on the treasury
67:30
and that is how you can give online if
67:32
you want to and while you're given to me
67:35
please remember
67:36
to give to elijah streams because if it
67:39
wasn't for them
67:40
you would not have these weekly shows
67:43
that have been happening actually since
67:45
october of uh is that 2008 2020 i think
67:50
yeah yeah 2020 all the way from october
67:53
up to election day and then we were
67:55
going to stop on november the 3rd and
67:57
god said tell steve i want one more day
67:59
you know he said that
68:00
one more day i have something to say he
68:02
didn't even tell me on november the 3rd
68:03
it was on november the 4th he began to
68:05
say what had happened what was going to
68:07
happen what people would be thinking
68:09
about it and then he would say what he
68:11
was going to have happen and ever since
68:14
that day we decided to not stop these
68:17
broadcasts that's right you have got a
68:20
lot of gratitude and things to steve uh
68:23
i'm a very um
68:25
i i'm moving the spirit a lot and i'm
68:27
very super busy but this has been an
68:29
anchor that i have no question there's
68:32
no no choice in my life that i do this
68:35
every week because god said you're going
68:36
to do it so because of him because if
68:39
steve has opened the door you've never
68:41
had before i'm not saying they are not
68:43
the prophets but the ones god is
68:45
speaking through and steve knows are
68:47
true and let me tell you if he finds out
68:49
they're not he's going to let you know
68:51
but this is his call on his life and
68:53
he's gone through a lot to sit where he
68:55
is right now
68:57
it hasn't been easy it never is you pay
68:59
a price so i hope you will open up your
69:01
pocketbooks and your wallets and you get
69:04
money and you send that to steve schultz
69:06

14:10
hey cat hi
14:11
yeah that was all for free you got to
14:13
watch all that for free
14:14
yes it was nice getting to see your
14:16
staff though people think you know
14:19
they see you and they think that's it
14:21
and it's not true really you've got to
14:23
have a lot of other people to do things
14:25
that's why it costs money and even
14:28
people say well why do you have to sell
14:30
products why do you have to do that and
14:31
i said well
14:32
because we put money out we have to pay
14:35
money out for all kinds of things where
14:36
you know the building the electricity
14:38
whatever just in normal things but then
14:40
when you have staff involved or if you
14:42
order a lot of equipment and supplies
14:44
and stuff to produce things you're
14:46
putting out
14:47
it does cost a lot of money and god is
14:49
faithful though but the staff is so
14:52
important it really is next to your own
14:54
family i have to say the staff that work
14:57
with you day to day is so important now
14:59
i'm going to be in agreement with what
15:01
you're doing or you're going to have
15:03
issues to believe in that god has called
15:06
you and placed you or he has
15:08
and to show honor and everybody needs to
15:10
show honor to one another
15:12
that's something in this new year that
15:14
we're doing we're going to make some
15:15
changes that's going to really help
15:17
everybody have more fun do things
15:18
together as our staff and we'll be some
15:22
at some point moving into a building
15:24
itself this year which will make
15:26
everything much easier for all of us
15:28
awesome awesome well kat we talked a
15:30
little bit off the air we're going to
15:32
take a twist not a bad twist a good
15:34
twist but
15:35
talk about
15:37
some things i'm trying to decide do i
15:38
just throw it open for anything first or
15:40
should i get to my questions that we
15:41
were talking about off the air what
15:43
would you like to do
15:44
um
15:46
go ahead with the things that are off
15:47
the air okay let's do that
15:50
let's talk about that first okay so
15:52
here's what's here's what the let me
15:54
just introduce it like this uh we get
15:56
lots and lots of emails and we can't
15:58
answer every single one but the probably
16:00
one of the most common
16:02
questions that comes out
16:04
just in general not just with cats show
16:06
but all the shows is they'll say steve
16:08
kat said
16:09
and robin said da da da da da
16:12
and they and they and they'll list what
16:14
it is they said and they'll say who's
16:15
right and basically who's wrong
16:18
and so i was talking to you about the
16:20
and i i it's very important for me to
16:23
tell the people
16:24
you and your husband are good friends
16:26
with robin and his wife robin and rob
16:28
yes we are so we are when you see things
16:32
really really differently at times
16:34
uh this is not a friendship breaker this
16:37
is not a deal break in your relationship
16:39
isn't it
16:40
no it's not okay so
16:43
so what happens i'll just continue with
16:44
the question then so robin had a very
16:46
intense word about the president's life
16:49
and praying for this his safety and all
16:51
that and i brought that up to you you
16:52
don't watch because you keep your
16:55
prophetic uh disconnected so that you
16:58
get your right from god if i'm saying
17:00
that right right
17:01
and i said that to you today about the
17:04
president's safety and what what was
17:05
your initial response about that
17:08
well i had of course um the father will
17:11
talk to me anything that has to now we
17:12
know who president we're talking about
17:15
um
17:16
yeah
17:17
anything comes up about him the father
17:19
will immediately tell me and then i will
17:21
do what is what i normally would do uh
17:24
there is a million hosts with him right
17:26
now in florida let's just say in florida
17:29
in florida right now a strategic
17:31
positions strategic places
17:34
um and their assignment is to be with
17:36
him as long as god is using him for
17:38
specific things they will remain
17:41
so i had done that that was it that was
17:43
the limit that's all he told me to do he
17:45
didn't tell me to um and let me say this
17:48
first i have to say this verse
17:50
when god chooses people to be a prophet
17:53
there that's the office of a prophet
17:55
that's not somebody who's real prophetic
17:58
or they see prophetic things or hear
18:00
them sometimes that is their office that
18:02
is a position
18:03
that gives them a lot of authority with
18:05
god he's going to clearly speak to them
18:07
but he does not tell every prophet the
18:09
same thing and you should never expect
18:11
for those who are new to it you can't
18:14
expect every prophet to say the same
18:16
exact words about the same exact thing
18:17
because we're not going to do that i
18:20
have my whole call in my life as a
18:21
prophet to train the body of christ to
18:23
be powerful
18:25
to know their spiritual weapons and do
18:27
that type of thing but also to know
18:28
about heaven my number one call is to
18:31
reveal heaven to earth i've been there
18:33
thousands of times so i'm going to speak
18:35
mainly about that if god has something
18:37
to say about things going on in the
18:38
earth he'll tell me i will certainly
18:40
tell people and right now we have a lot
18:42
going on in the earth and he shows me
18:44
different parts of that and what to do
18:46
about the different things he's going to
18:47
show robin something different that
18:49
doesn't make either one of us wrong it
18:51
doesn't it's just that he's handling
18:53
that for god and dealing with that i'm
18:55
dealing with the another part of it
18:57
hank's dealing with another part of that
18:58
daniel i mean we all have our part with
19:01
god but one thing we do do is we know we
19:03
each hear god and we'll honor them as
19:07
the office of a prophet and so i would
19:09
encourage people what you're being told
19:11
in the moment um you should participate
19:14
in that like praying for the president
19:16
of course is always going to be
19:17
important and i would just say this
19:19
they've always been trying to take him
19:20
out people
19:22
yeah they could get rid of anyone on the
19:25
earth it would be him
19:27
because he is a big threat but god's got
19:28
him in his hand but robin because it was
19:32
revealed that's what he shares what is
19:34
revealed to me i will share and you're
19:37
never going to be disappointed in
19:39
hearing the voice of god and making sure
19:42
that it is all covered but by different
19:44
ones of us so don't expect us all to say
19:47
exactly the word and i can't validate
19:49
robin i didn't hear that from god i
19:52
can't validate hank he can't validate me
19:55
or johnny in law or any of the other
19:56
prophets we have we're accountable for
19:59
what he shows us and tells us to say and
20:02
to and to share and so that's what we're
20:05
doing yeah
20:07
he wouldn't have us here yeah and i'll
20:10
say this let me add this because there's
20:11
there's that one that just came up and
20:14
the one that we get even more than that
20:15
and you know i i am a perfect piece i'll
20:18
just tell you i didn't used to be this
20:20
way but i
20:21
after knowing cat and knowing robin i'm
20:24
at perfect peace that robin
20:26
holds a position that at any moment of
20:28
the day
20:29
the rapture could happen i think he but
20:32
he also holds
20:33
he also holds and he said on the air
20:35
that what cat's position in his position
20:37
could all be true at the same time i
20:39
don't quite get what he means but i get
20:41
robin
20:43
robin knows what he means and i get cat
20:45
i tend to be like for everything i see
20:48
you know this says this gospel of the
20:50
kingdom will be preached to all the
20:51
world and then the end will come where
20:53
there's about five billion of the seven
20:54
who have not yet had the gospel preached
20:56
them so it's easy it's easy for me to
20:59
say we got some time we got some work to
21:01
do but there's an imminent
21:03
uh in the heart and understanding of
21:06
robin and so and how about how do you
21:08
what else would you like to say about
21:09
that cat
21:10
i would say that um
21:13
it depends on the way god uses a prophet
21:15
also i have to say that
21:17
um some prophets are more stubborn not
21:20
saying robin is stubborn in any way
21:23
but even in the old testament
21:25
and in the new testament there were
21:26
prophets that weren't very happy about
21:28
what god gave them to say but they said
21:30
it anyway
21:31
and uh i can just say that
21:34
you know we we all know that um
21:37
jonah didn't want to say some things
21:39
right and uh but god had him in the end
21:42
say what he needed him to say and i
21:44
think obedience is very key
21:46
uh for the prophet to realize uh
21:48
whatever he is saying i will say it they
21:51
all also they are still individuals we
21:54
are individuals like i i'm just going to
21:56
say this i like different colors i like
21:58
different food i like different things i
22:00
i'm not in a box in that in that that we
22:03
all have to eat the same thing or like
22:05
the same thing so inside our heart what
22:07
we've been raised in what we understand
22:10
and and as pointed out in the word is
22:13
what we will follow but i
22:16
was taken on purpose and shown before
22:19
earth began
22:20
after
22:21
even after the new earth is here god has
22:23
on purpose taking me down his own
22:26
timeline
22:27
and so for me
22:29
i will focus and say what god has shown
22:31
me on his timeline
22:33
not any calendar not anybody's calendar
22:35
anybody else's timeline no matter how
22:37
many are out there i have to say what
22:39
god has shown me on his own and on his
22:41
own we are not anywhere near
22:44
i know sometimes people are impacted by
22:46
the things are going on right now he's
22:48
actually setting up for what's about to
22:50
happen
22:51
the next 100 years would be so key to
22:53
seeing the power and the glory in this
22:55
earth and god is not willing to give
22:57
that up he's going to make sure it
22:59
happens he's going to love all those who
23:01
stand and speak for him he'll honor them
23:03
he'll reward them and so you you trust
23:06
that god knows what he's doing and this
23:09
only thing that will happen
23:11
uh uh you know in the end is what god
23:14
wants to happen his timeline will happen
23:17
his way and on his day and it says no
23:20
man knows the day that the lord will
23:24
return and even that's not the end
23:25
people
23:26
please you need to really understand
23:28
when christ returns is not the end okay
23:31
that's the beginning of another whole
23:33
age you know the millennial age will
23:35
happen that's christ himself sitting on
23:37
the throne in jerusalem it's going to
23:39
happen that's a thousand more years so
23:41
you can't really talk about the earth
23:42
being destroyed and disappearing and
23:44
dissipating and i'm not saying robin's
23:46
saying that or hank or anyone else i'm
23:48
just saying
23:49
it can't happen because things have not
23:51
happened that god in his own words said
23:53
would happen yet rest assured you're in
23:55
the sum of the greatest times that are
23:57
about to happen not the opposite and all
24:00
those who were were pure to their word
24:03
and their understanding
24:04
when they get to heaven they'll still be
24:05
happy anyway
24:08
it's not over until the father says it's
24:12
over
24:13
and we're in the great days that seem
24:15
impossible to you
24:17
but not with god we had some guests that
24:20
have come to us and especially when we
24:22
were in the studio not so much now but
24:24
we had some guests and they would
24:25
describe several different programs that
24:27
they were on one of them they had to
24:29
spell out pages and pages and pages of
24:32
their theology
24:34
to tell the this tv station so they
24:36
would now if they would be allowed you
24:37
know when is the rapture
24:40
you know and i don't i've never seen the
24:42
form but i understand it's very
24:43
voluminous
24:45
um and and i think let me just tell you
24:47
folks that's not us we want to know that
24:50
a prophet is is prophesying they're a
24:52
person of good character they have the
24:54
office of a prophet uh or close to it
24:57
and maybe i'll put it that way their
24:59
character is good their reputation's
25:00
good we're not gonna ask them
25:03
what's their va what's their uh
25:05
position on when the rapture is we're
25:07
not gonna ask him those kind of
25:08
questions it's one of the main reasons
25:11
is
25:11
that particular issue has just split the
25:14
body of christ we don't want to do that
25:15
so whatever your position is say it with
25:18
firm but we won't we will not tend to
25:20
even major on that issue
25:24
and i'm talking kind of out of both
25:25
sides of my mouth because it is true and
25:28
count you've seen this it is true
25:30
that i and we do tend to
25:33
gravitate towards this position which is
25:36
we're going to be here for a while we've
25:37
got work to do it is true
25:39
but
25:40
we are
25:43
the last thing last scripture in the
25:46
adjustment occupy until i come he never
25:50
said sit there and try to figure out
25:52
every day and everything and every month
25:54
so everything lines up with what you you
25:56
assume will happen
25:58
you know it says to occupy that means
26:00
take authority that doesn't mean sit
26:02
around and wait doesn't mean sit on the
26:04
sofa it means you take authority you
26:06
will be active in the kingdom and preach
26:08
the gospel the king be active and
26:10
demonstrating and manifesting who god is
26:13
that's what we're all supposed to be
26:14
doing right now not trying to figure out
26:16
if we have to drag our rapture rug out
26:18
or escape to the mountains he didn't say
26:20
to do any of that
26:22
you're supposed to be busy doing things
26:24
for him until the father says to his son
26:28
going down you know i think of that
26:30
scripture where jesus tells the story
26:32
about there was a master and he went to
26:34
a far away place where he's talking
26:35
about
26:37
the son going to be back with his father
26:40
and and though the servants you know
26:42
were given a task to do
26:44
and then after a while they kept not
26:46
coming back kept not coming back and
26:47
they said he's not coming back so they
26:49
began to beat their fellow servants and
26:51
put them in bondage and and then then
26:54
basically when the master did
26:56
come there was there was trouble to pay
26:59
you know a lot of trouble you know and
27:02
and the bottom line was if the masters
27:04
delay they're supposed to be doing he
27:06
gave them a job to do they were just
27:08
supposed to be doing it you know that
27:09
was what that whole parable is and and
27:11
what was important was how they treated
27:13
their fellow servants a long way that
27:15
was what what he was looking at and and
27:18
so anyway well we could talk about that
27:20
for a lot but that's the fascinating
27:21
thing but just remember folks
27:23
the guests we have on we don't
27:25
pre-screen them that they have to agree
27:27
with everything theologically especially
27:29
as it relates to that now i'm going to
27:31
say one other thing and i'm going to
27:32
admit this is a personal bias we knew
27:35
and felt absolutely convicted through
27:38
our prophets there are
27:40
earlier ones that god was saying he who
27:43
he had picked the man in florida who
27:45
starts with the t that was the man and
27:47
god had not changed his mind so yes in
27:50
that vein that wasn't a theological
27:52
position that was like what
27:54
if you're hearing what we're hearing
27:56
those are the prophets that we brought
27:58
on i will say that so you know we're not
28:00
going to bring someone on
28:02
um there was someone that used to write
28:04
for us and he took a position
28:07
and his position was and this is what he
28:10
said
28:11
he said god said
28:15
deal with it
28:16
biden's president now it doesn't matter
28:18
if he stole he's president now pray for
28:20
him well now he's not riding for us i'm
28:23
not mad at him
28:24
i'm not he's not an enemy but he's not
28:27
riding force he's not a guest
28:29
so that kind of position we'll take but
28:32
we don't we won't ruin a friendship over
28:34
it
28:35
it wasn't a punishment we just didn't
28:37
schedule them for the show or we don't
28:38
schedule his work so i think that makes
28:40
sense so well kat anything else you want
28:42
to share before we get into questions
28:44
the thing i just want to um
28:47
i have to say what god has said to me
28:48
almost every single day
28:50
to keep a heart of celebration
28:53
because that is his plan
28:55
and no matter what you see going on i'm
28:57
not saying it isn't happening i'm well
28:59
aware that's why i take authority over
29:00
it all the time uh make sure you're not
29:03
participating
29:04
when you participate with what the
29:06
darkness is or what the plans of the
29:07
enemy is you're highlighting that
29:10
you're supposed to talk more about the
29:12
power and the love of god and god's
29:15
plans in this time that inspires
29:17
encourages and it just it just dissolves
29:21
fear because you know yourself god's
29:23
never given us a spirit of fear but a
29:25
power love and a sound mind so what you
29:29
should be doing right now in this moment
29:30
no matter what's going on you should be
29:32
walking in the power of god having a
29:35
sound mind and no fear whatsoever that's
29:37
what you should be doing
29:39
good good good cat well i've got
29:42
eight-year-old lana if i'm saying her
29:44
name right with the first question she
29:46
says did jesus always look young
29:49
even as an adult so that's her question
29:52
well i'm quite certain
29:55
that he could not have been young and
29:57
gone to the cross
30:00
he couldn't have been young in the fact
30:02
that um
30:03
you know maybe he didn't look totally
30:05
mature or at his age he was 33
30:08
and we all know that that doesn't mean
30:10
you look sorry sweet and heaven please i
30:12
probably hear that more than anything
30:13
else
30:14
jesus had a light that was in him all
30:17
the time
30:18
and and he was a real character he was
30:22
he knew who he was at that point in his
30:24
life he knew he was the son of god he
30:26
knew that all of creation was made by
30:28
him he walked with such uh confidence in
30:31
this earth
30:32
knowing he made this and he came to die
30:35
for those who were on the earth that was
30:37
his goal but i can tell you he laughed a
30:40
lot and a lot of people don't see him
30:41
that way they seem only serious or
30:43
fierce you know when he up up ended the
30:46
whole temple courtyard and everything
30:48
because they were doing things wrong
30:49
there that's why he did it but he was
30:51
focused on what god sent him for what
30:52
his father sent him for to let people
30:54
know the truth to let them know that
30:56
you're not supposed to be afraid even he
30:57
taught about not being afraid of the
30:59
darkness so he walked in confidence but
31:02
it made him a little bit bold he was
31:04
bold but he was liked very much even the
31:07
sinners liked him because guess what he
31:09
didn't speak doom and gloom to people
31:11
even back then he took about the power
31:13
of god the life of god the light in us
31:15
you know why he came and and i think
31:18
that that probably would set him apart
31:20
he probably seemed maybe had that spirit
31:22
of youth in him since he was actually
31:24
eternal right and i think that's more
31:27
than what she she's talking about he
31:29
always had so much life in him there was
31:32
nothing that even probably was even
31:34
close to even aging but he did reach the
31:36
physical age of 33 he was strong even in
31:40
the natural he was strong he lifted
31:42
trees he built he was a carpenter he
31:45
used timbers he moved those himself so
31:47
he was strong he was in great shape he
31:49
was happy at the light of god in him uh
31:52
people wanted to be with him all the
31:53
time so i can see that he had that
31:56
spirit of use or life in him so as far
31:59
as that goes yes
32:01
he always acted like he was he was never
32:04
would probably act that he was an old
32:06
person at all nor did he even think that
32:08
way he loved to be with children also
32:10
all the time which to many people back
32:13
then probably would have been more of a
32:14
a chore or something like that he never
32:17
felt that way he liked the life the
32:19
imagination uh the belief that they had
32:22
and so in that spirit of youth i think
32:25
that's probably always going to be in
32:26
him good good all right now i've got um
32:30
this is it says i i
32:32
imc ega so i don't know if that's a name
32:34
or a username it says username here
32:37
and the question is is god's hair like
32:38
pure wool as described in daniel
32:41
7 9 says cat cat said she touched it
32:44
could she run her fingers through woolly
32:47
hair i guess that's the way she wrote it
32:49
now i i need to make a slight
32:51
correction which i rarely do they said
32:54
white as wool white as well did not say
32:58
it was wool it is not woolly
33:00
he was talking about you know that was
33:02
something he could equate to back in
33:04
that day you have to understand you
33:06
think of the culture of the day
33:08
the sheep the sheep who were like the
33:10
pure sheep whether they their wall was
33:12
white it was extremely white and they
33:15
would stand out with their black faces
33:17
if you never actually saw a sheep you
33:18
should go look it up uh back in that day
33:21
their their their wool was very white
33:24
and it was highlighted by the black face
33:26
that they had black wolves and so maybe
33:29
you never thought about that but god's
33:30
hair is no way is it woolly jesus is not
33:33
wooly it said it was white as
33:37
because on the earth they couldn't have
33:38
anything else that they could at that
33:40
day think of to compare it to
33:43
his hair was not his hair was alive when
33:46
i touched it life shot into my arm it
33:49
shot up my
33:50
spiritual
33:52
and i'm always um
33:54
somebody had painted a painting of a
33:56
horse believe it or not with other
33:58
colors mixed in it but when i looked at
33:59
that picture
34:01
it i saw the face of god in it
34:05
and uh but i don't want to equate him to
34:07
looking like a horse but like the mane
34:09
on the horse was the most beautiful
34:11
hair i'd ever seen on a horse but
34:13
literally i don't think they realized
34:15
that they painted what was imposed over
34:18
that looked like the face of god i mean
34:20
it looked like
34:21
that
34:21
his eyes are flames of fire real flames
34:24
of fire but his hair uh the father's
34:26
hair is like longer than jesus's hairs
34:30
it's beautiful his fear is amazing but
34:33
life is in every part of his being and
34:36
when i barely touch the
34:38
strands of his hair i even now right now
34:41
having goosebumps taking him out
34:43
life was in his hair it was like moving
34:46
not moving a lot but it was moving
34:48
because it was life in it it was the
34:50
whitest white i'd ever seen light was
34:52
coming from it
34:54
and i'm sure that's why they tried to
34:56
describe him he said it was white as
34:58
wool
34:59
it's about the whitest white i've ever
35:00
seen and again because the father can do
35:04
what he wants to he can either let all
35:06
of the glory come from him where you see
35:08
nothing people been they haven't seen
35:10
nothing but
35:11
maybe images of eyes or the shape of a
35:13
head he has so much glory pouring from
35:16
him but he really wanted to establish to
35:18
me he has a body his arms his legs has a
35:21
torso even though he's got the spiritual
35:23
body it's real it's very real and he'll
35:27
reach out and he'll hold you when you
35:28
get to having them if he lays his hand
35:31
on you sometimes he'll just walk behind
35:32
me and lay his hand on me i get so
35:35
undone i'm talking about on the earth
35:36
sometimes he will come and just visit
35:39
him briefly and then leave and he
35:40
actually did that in the old testament
35:42
so it's not a strange thing
35:45
and you need to believe in your heart
35:47
that he cares enough about you he's
35:49
probably been with you and you didn't
35:50
even know it if he didn't make himself
35:52
visible
35:54
you maybe felt the presence so powerful
35:56
if you've ever been consumed by absolute
35:58
waves of love that would be the father
36:01
standing near you he is love his son
36:06
carries that love but he is love and and
36:09
but the light coming from the glory
36:11
coming from his hair and his whole uh
36:13
but he condemned that and sometimes when
36:16
you come home to heaven to stay he will
36:18
let you see his face he'll let you see
36:20
the flames of fire that's his passion
36:23
burning for you but his hair it wasn't
36:25
woolly and it never said it was it said
36:28
white
36:29
so it's extremely white it's kind of
36:30
long it is is wavy but like i said the
36:34
waves of his hair
36:37
and i just was so undone just to be even
36:40
near him
36:41
near him at the throne well you this
36:44
gave me two more questions that had just
36:46
occurred to me so i'm going to ask him
36:47
um
36:49
have has jesus ever come to you
36:52
in the form of the line of the tribe of
36:54
judah and if he's coming to you in the
36:56
form of a lion have you can you see his
36:59
jesus face in that lies it seemed like
37:01
what you just described the father's
37:03
face and the horse or whatever um
37:06
almost never has he come in the in the
37:09
no he's just come in person okay
37:11
i mean like you're seeing me i yeah
37:13
because you know he has his he's
37:15
immortal he has his body he has his body
37:18
back from the grave he's got that body
37:20
you can literally put your hands in the
37:22
actually the the the holes are here oh
37:24
wow if they had been here it would have
37:26
pulled off on the cross you know that
37:28
nail could have that the holes are right
37:30
here and if if you're with him
37:33
in heaven somewhere and a breeze blows
37:36
you can see those marks still
37:38
still in the head where the crown of
37:40
thorns were
37:41
but he's so
37:43
amazingly powerful he sat next to me in
37:46
my own home and put his arm around me
37:49
i thought it was gonna melt into the
37:52
of all the things he said on my loveseat
37:54
i'll never get rid of that loveseat okay
37:56
never ever ever
37:58
get on it and feel his presence today
38:00
wow
38:02
when it my home is in stores right now
38:04
because we'll be moving whoever sat on
38:06
it could feel his presence just come up
38:08
around them so
38:11
his anointing and his presence is so
38:13
tangible a lot of people said i never
38:16
could see him if he visited him as i
38:18
felt him i felt him put his arms around
38:20
me
38:21
it's one of the most glorious things and
38:23
in heaven you can see him whenever you
38:24
want to but i've seen him in person he's
38:27
not like i would say he's not a pretty
38:29
boy he's a strong
38:31
looking uh
38:33
god he's strong
38:34
and he does still have muscle
38:37
um
38:38
his physical body
38:40
he was a carpenter okay his hands looked
38:42
like they were the hands of a carpenter
38:44
but if man i'm just telling you just
38:46
want to be near him i could just say
38:48
that
38:49
that's amazing now a minute ago you said
38:52
um and i never thought this until you
38:54
just said it you said
38:56
something like he might have even you're
38:58
talking about he the lord your father
39:00
might have even been with you but you
39:02
didn't know it was him and i'm thinking
39:03
wait a minute is it possible that the
39:05
father visits every one of his kids in
39:08
person
39:09
i think probably at some time in their
39:11
life he probably did
39:14
interesting you have to remember he is
39:16
the father the father he was your
39:18
original father no matter who raised you
39:20
on the earth he is the number one father
39:23
to you because he carried you in him he
39:26
carried you lived in him there's no if
39:28
you could look inside god you would not
39:30
see there's no distance in him there's
39:32
no back to him on the inside this
39:35
glorious river of life and stones of
39:37
fire and little spirits of life playing
39:40
in there that's where you were so he
39:42
carried you before he sent you to this
39:45
earth and planted you you know in in the
39:48
womb of the the mother he he
39:51
carried you and put you like a seed in
39:53
there and uh and then you grew but he
39:56
wants you to know him i can tell you
39:58
that's why jesus's greatest thing
40:00
himself was he what he talked we talked
40:02
about the father all the time because he
40:04
loves the father
40:06
and that was one of his biggest topics
40:08
was talking about the father and
40:09
mentioned him he said he even said
40:11
there's none good but god he was talking
40:12
about his father he was good but to him
40:16
he's the greatest that the father would
40:18
be the greatest to him
40:19
awesome all right this is kind of a fun
40:22
question carla is asking this you know
40:24
there's that thing i live in texas for a
40:25
while you know they say texas there's a
40:27
saying when you live in texas that texas
40:29
is a is a whole other country you know
40:32
they call it a whole other country so
40:33
here's maybe that's what's in this
40:35
carla's mind she says is there a place
40:37
in heaven that is like texas
40:40
i would love to get into her mind and
40:43
say what is she looking for you know
40:45
she absolutely is right there is a place
40:48
like texas
40:50
there's a place that's got um
40:52
the same terrain
40:56
back in this day in this day like i'm in
40:58
the future talking
40:59
um
41:01
on the earth you would say oh there's
41:04
herds of wild horses running around in
41:06
texas it's beautiful the river you know
41:09
the the i don't want to name rivers
41:11
because i'm not so good with topography
41:13
or geography down here on the earth and
41:15
having them really good with it
41:17
but but you would see certain things in
41:20
texas in the state of texas there's a
41:22
strength in texas
41:24
uh there's a frequency in texas itself
41:26
that god made of freedom he actually
41:29
planted freedom in texas
41:31
and uh not that he didn't put it
41:33
somewhere else but some there's some
41:34
states or some regions or even some
41:36
countries he actually put more of
41:38
something in the foundation of that
41:40
whole area and texas wears freedom it
41:44
does they had to fight for their own
41:46
freedom back in the day and by the way
41:48
they wouldn't mind doing it right now
41:52
but in this part i know because we're
41:55
just going to go crazy right now we're
41:56
going to probably get people's people
41:58
going to love all this and they won't
41:59
i've seen people went home to to texas
42:04
it's a whole lot of the west who live in
42:07
this western that looks like the west
42:10
and not wild though maybe the holy
42:12
spirit would show up he'd be wild but
42:15
but there are areas in in heaven that
42:17
look like the west they just are and
42:20
someone in particular i have seen
42:23
absolutely in heaven would be john wayne
42:25
i don't mind dropping names people i've
42:27
seen him there what is he doing making
42:30
cowboy movies what did he do on the
42:31
earth all right you use your gift in
42:34
heaven and i saw him making a cowboy
42:37
movie uh in this place that looks just
42:39
like the west except there's no bandits
42:41
okay you're not gonna roast get scorched
42:43
be bit by scorpions none of that happens
42:46
so in your natural mind you always go to
42:48
well this is there and it's not there
42:50
it's a glorious beautiful place but it
42:52
looks just like the west and i happen to
42:54
know he lives in this part
42:56
john wayne lives in that part of heaven
42:58
he loves that part of heaven it's got
43:00
rivers running through it off of the
43:02
crystal sea but it to me when i saw it
43:05
looked like the west
43:06
and so yes there is areas that look like
43:08
the west there's places that look like
43:10
it snows all the time
43:12
that has fall all the time and like i
43:15
love what the hell the father explained
43:16
to me why we have seasons here
43:19
we have a season you know that comes and
43:21
goes right like the winter
43:23
spring comes and goes but in heaven they
43:26
are like that all the time and the
43:28
father said when i made the seasons on
43:30
the earth i took a shadow of four of my
43:33
favorite places in heaven more than four
43:36
don't say i said there's four places i
43:38
took a shadow of four of my favorite
43:40
places in heaven and put on the earth as
43:42
seasons
43:44
wow that's amazing that is amazing now i
43:47
got to ask you this because there's
43:48
something you just said you said you're
43:50
not so good with the topography down
43:52
here as you are in heaven
43:54
which begs the question you've been
43:56
there so many times if you were to sit
43:58
with a piece of paper
44:00
could you draw out this is where this is
44:03
and this is over
44:05
as as if it was a kind of map would you
44:08
know where you have your orientation of
44:09
where you are
44:11
you know steve you've heard me say many
44:12
times heaven is the world
44:15
that's why the earth is round hello flat
44:17
earth people forget it
44:19
heaven is the world it's around it's a
44:22
round or
44:24
if the earth was made of the shadow of
44:26
heaven then the earth would have to be
44:29
round because heaven is
44:31
so the father's house that jesus talked
44:33
about in my father's house so many
44:35
mansions
44:36
and people have for ages try to picture
44:38
how many mansions can you get in a
44:40
building
44:43
because your mind is earthbound right
44:45
the the house that the father calls it
44:47
it's a whole world it's a whole world
44:49
and i pretty much could draw kind of
44:51
what's at one of the tops and what's i
44:53
can tell you what's on the bottom of the
44:54
world called heaven that's michael's
44:56
headquarters oh really really yeah
44:59
because they're saying they're sending
45:00
them to the earth it makes sense right
45:02
it's what it's way up beyond anything
45:04
you can see
45:06
you're not going to find heaven with no
45:08
no telescope and no no a satellite or
45:11
anything you will ever see heaven
45:13
because it's a spiritual world a literal
45:16
place where you live literally in your
45:18
spiritual body uh it's an unseen it says
45:21
that what was made that is seen was made
45:24
by that what was unseen so there's a lot
45:26
of activity up there in the spirit realm
45:28
uh that you in your mind couldn't even
45:30
possibly imagine but but god from where
45:34
he sits can see everything it actually
45:36
says the earth is his footstool
45:39
so you know he had to shrink himself to
45:41
come and walk on me yeah well right
45:44
but he had to shrink himself and where
45:46
are his foot touched the mountains they
45:48
set on fire there was a fire so if you
45:51
think he's unaware of what's going on
45:52
you don't know him
45:54
yeah
45:55
so yeah so this earth is a shadow and a
45:59
type of what is in heaven
46:01
but also even the way he made it so
46:03
there's mountains there's rivers there's
46:05
an ocean in heaven called the crystal
46:07
sea
46:08
um there's there's the there's places
46:11
that look like the west it looked like
46:12
the north it looked like
46:14
uh the south there's places that look
46:16
like spring okay
46:18
there's many places what i could do and
46:20
actually have sketched myself in a lot
46:23
of my journals and one day we will
46:26
actually make a movie we are going to
46:28
make a movie it would take you to these
46:30
little places in heaven that i was shown
46:32
i don't think i connect i could connect
46:34
the whole world together but there are
46:36
places and i know what's near them those
46:39
i could do something like that awesome
46:42
awesome yeah
46:43
it never occurred to me that you i know
46:46
you might if you were going to walk it
46:48
or fly it on your own go down here turn
46:50
left here
46:52
i mean you would know certain places you
46:54
would know where they are maybe i never
46:56
i always have people with me so i don't
46:58
get lost in the airport okay yeah i do
47:01
remember that i remember seeing your
47:03
husband take you by the arm through the
47:05
airport you walked right past this we
47:07
were
47:08
okay uh this person
47:11
lin for christ is their username they
47:12
want to know what what is the book of
47:15
records i don't know if that's
47:17
i don't know if there's a if you've just
47:19
talked about that i'm not sure if that's
47:21
the bible term of book of records she
47:23
wants to know what's the book of records
47:25
there are so many books
47:27
i couldn't name them all you think he
47:30
doesn't have one here's my birthday's
47:32
right
47:32
the father is a writer okay
47:35
the lord was the orator he the the lord
47:37
likes to speak he doesn't care to write
47:40
things i just know that about jesus even
47:42
when he was learning the torah he loved
47:44
to read read read he didn't like so much
47:46
to write things that's just the way he
47:48
was but the father is definitely a
47:50
writer he loves to write record in old
47:54
school it was old school to be
47:57
timeless school i guess you'd have to
47:58
say it's timeless he loves to write in
48:01
books there's the lamb's book of life
48:03
that's a whole different one he has a
48:05
book of remembrance that's a whole
48:06
different book
48:08
but there are things that are recorded
48:09
there's actually a hall of records
48:11
there's a whole hall where things have
48:13
been recorded over time
48:15
accurately recorded by him
48:18
so there's a whole hall of records
48:20
there's one that pertains to you
48:21
yourself and things in your life there's
48:24
there's your own book he wrote i wrote i
48:26
wrote you know your your book for you
48:29
every day of your life he wrote it in a
48:31
book that's a whole separate book that's
48:32
just for you so there are books of
48:35
records there's a hall of records um
48:38
there's so many different places to go
48:39
and see and be be a part of in heaven
48:43
you'd have to be here for eternity to
48:45
even begin to be part of it um but
48:48
there's beautiful places that record
48:50
things there's different ways no things
48:52
are like we would say video audio they
48:54
don't call that in heaven they just
48:56
things are captured
48:58
they capture things and say that you
49:01
don't say they read they don't record
49:02
they capture them
49:04
which when they capture something or
49:06
they have retained something it's what
49:09
it felt like what it smelled like what
49:12
was said what was done really uh it was
49:14
very accurate but for he for himself
49:17
he does have a book of remembrance
49:19
that's his favorite book to write in so
49:21
he he doesn't have to but he does it
49:24
because he wants to do it and he
49:26
remembers every kind thing let's just go
49:28
there every kind wonderful thing you've
49:31
done for him every person you've helped
49:33
every person you fed every time you uh
49:36
picked up a wounded animal i mean animal
49:38
health whatever it was it was kindness
49:41
he records and remembers that
49:44
and then when you pray
49:46
when you pray and say father uh i really
49:49
would like to have this or i need this
49:51
now he goes back to your book and
49:52
remember says look at all the kind
49:54
things they did for me look how they
49:56
treated this person even when they
49:57
weren't nice so i can tell you
50:00
that's good there are books of records
50:03
halls of records in heaven so and but
50:05
much of it is very beautiful wonderful
50:07
things it's not always like they're
50:09
writing every bad deed done when you get
50:11
born again that's kind of like wiped out
50:14
if you if you repent for your sins it's
50:17
like you never did them you need to
50:19
remember that and you've been sinning
50:20
lately please go again again
50:23
please repent again god didn't never
50:25
give us the ability to freely sin once
50:28
you get saved people actually believe
50:30
that and some even teach that he never
50:32
said that it said since grace of balance
50:35
should sin also bound in god's head god
50:38
forbid so because there's grace for
50:41
eternal life and grace for forgiving you
50:44
that doesn't mean you should just live a
50:46
sinful life you're not you're not doing
50:48
anything good for god even for yourself
50:50
or your destiny so we're just kind of
50:52
went there because of the record thing
50:54
but when you do repent no matter what
50:57
you've done you sincerely repent god
51:00
wipes it away and doesn't remember it
51:02
because remember the books of
51:03
remembrance are the good things right
51:06
the book of records might be other
51:07
things and when you pretend that part is
51:10
wiped out that's like that you never
51:12
know
51:13
and you said that they don't use the
51:15
word video and audio but they capture it
51:17
and it's like a 3d
51:18
movie video thing yeah
51:21
in our language but if a person goes to
51:23
heaven and wants to look at their life
51:25
and they're not going to see sin that
51:26
was forgiven or they wouldn't even be
51:28
there but would they be able to see
51:30
things like that time they went through
51:32
an intersection and an angel came and
51:34
did this to this car and would that kind
51:36
of thing be recorded
51:38
it would be recorded but also would be
51:40
all the funny silly things you did
51:44
like like like what like when you were
51:46
in your pre-teens in your early days the
51:50
wow like you know i'm gonna jump this
51:52
canal like he will
51:53
see how that worked out and of course it
51:55
would be miserably fail but you wouldn't
51:57
get hurt but funny silly things you did
52:00
you will see that you actually go to
52:02
these they actually have a place where
52:04
your friends and your own family when
52:07
you get to heaven you're not going to
52:08
escape seeing that movie because they're
52:10
going to take you to see it
52:11
and uh it'll be delightful this is like
52:14
the silly things you did that he rescued
52:16
you with like
52:18
sometimes you didn't get rescued
52:21
you know maybe some of the fashion of
52:23
the day when you dress like i don't know
52:25
emcee hammer or something
52:27
would they show things like
52:30
um i love anthony by the way he's a very
52:33
cool person yeah yeah um would they show
52:36
things like um
52:38
how the lord when they show how he
52:42
talked to this
52:44
person to come share the gospel like
52:46
that where they would show how he got a
52:48
hold of how your life was
52:50
apprehended through the through other
52:52
people would they show that kind of
52:53
thing i think you definitely
52:55
i think you probably absolutely see that
52:57
i know that you will see this is what
52:59
you do see
53:00
you see your life relive with the
53:02
operations of the spirit realm from
53:04
heaven's perspective oh
53:06
every time your life was rescued every
53:09
time uh a god intervened that you didn't
53:12
know about you'll see all of that okay
53:16
very cool very very good born again of
53:17
course when you get born again but once
53:19
when you see yourself get bored again
53:21
you will flash up to heaven in the video
53:24
or this movie and you'll see how all of
53:26
heaven celebrated including father's day
53:29
when you got born again
53:31
how they celebrated yeah yes yeah that's
53:34
always been a hard one maybe you've seen
53:36
what you're talking about but
53:38
on the earth there could be a in a given
53:40
day even though we've heard of so
53:44
many people get saved in china and
53:46
underground church but there could be
53:47
hundreds of thousands of people getting
53:49
saved today coming to the lord and yet
53:52
when i see that scripture it says
53:53
there's more joy in heaven over one
53:55
sinner who repents and and so how does
53:58
it seems like
53:59
heaven would be constantly in a state of
54:01
celebration maybe it is how do they all
54:04
have a rejoice is it that is that what
54:06
they're doing is constantly celebrating
54:13
well
54:14
they do celebrate all the time people
54:16
and especially their families or friends
54:18
or something like they're really going
54:19
to celebrate uh that their family member
54:22
got born again oh they can't stop
54:24
talking about they go all over heaven
54:25
and talk about even for the people
54:26
really really celebration is such in
54:29
their heart knowing that forever they'll
54:30
be together for eternity so it is a big
54:32
thing it's a big thing to know that your
54:34
family members got born again so
54:37
to use it in a practical way uh let's
54:39
say i and my wife uh went to heaven one
54:42
you know events different times now
54:43
we're friends and uh maybe our
54:46
grandchild was not was walking away from
54:48
the lord okay a grandchild now they're
54:50
all just babies almost
54:52
but if
54:53
at the time when that grandchild comes
54:56
to the lord
54:57
i'm running up to drain or she's running
54:59
up to me and said did you hear
55:02
so and so got saved right is it kind of
55:04
like that
55:05
huh well actually what what actually
55:08
happens is the father lets you know
55:10
right before it happens and you watch it
55:13
you go to this
55:14
design where you can look down on the
55:16
earth and you declare over your family
55:17
members and stuff and there's like these
55:20
columns around heaven and when someone's
55:22
face comes up on these different columns
55:25
or like big monitors they know on those
55:27
columns when it comes up they're about
55:29
to get born again so they will run into
55:31
one of these portals that are
55:33
huge places you walk you run up these
55:35
steps and look over the balcony you
55:36
actually can watch your family members
55:38
getting born again
55:39
then the whole place breaks it the whole
55:41
place celebrates every time so if you're
55:43
there with a thousand people watching
55:45
the family members you can imagine the
55:46
celebration going on if they're all
55:48
there to watch their family members get
55:50
born again yeah well it's like they're
55:52
all looking down but they're sitting
55:53
down
55:54
wow okay uh this person wants
55:58
to know can you command demons out of
56:01
somebody without the permission of the
56:02
person you're praying for and i guess
56:05
i mean that's deliverance so i don't
56:06
know if there's a special
56:08
what they have in their mind whether
56:09
it's a ministry setting
56:12
you can certainly
56:14
cast a demon out of somebody right
56:16
without their permission i'm not sure
56:18
it actually says in the bible that's
56:20
what christ gives us the power to cast
56:22
out demons you know he says that right
56:23
he says that so anywhere where you are
56:26
if you're in authority if you have the
56:28
understanding of what's going on usually
56:31
the holy spirit will move on you to
56:33
he'll just say cast out that demon and
56:34
you will do in jesus name i i've done it
56:37
many times in different places and it
56:39
didn't even have to be like a church
56:40
setting it didn't and that wasn't
56:42
anything that was planned um you know
56:44
outside of a theater or something and if
56:47
if it manifests that means if you see it
56:49
the manifestation of one you you have
56:52
every right and authority to cast that
56:54
demon out
56:56
lots of times people aren't even in
56:57
control of their own mind anymore you
56:59
absolutely have the right to cast that
57:01
demon out there are some people who have
57:03
them and want them and i know that
57:05
sounds awful but they do and they know
57:06
what they are
57:09
and then they want it you expound what
57:12
do you mean cat they want them
57:15
when they know that they're demons what
57:17
do you mean they want them can you be
57:19
more specific
57:21
well i i i don't know
57:24
about the darkness today but i will just
57:25
say they they talk about people who who
57:28
were there's a difference by the way
57:30
there's a huge difference in being
57:32
influenced by demons and being possessed
57:35
by demons okay oh what we're talking
57:38
about the casting out is someone who has
57:40
one living in them and you that may
57:43
freak you out but jesus lives in you
57:45
okay jesus when you got born again he
57:46
stepped on the inside of you he lives
57:48
there people watch what you're saying
57:51
i always like to say give jesus a good
57:52
day give your angels a good day your
57:54
angels were sent to be with you they're
57:56
also present they're also there uh no
57:59
matter where where you are your angels
58:01
are seen i mean they're seen by each
58:03
other of course
58:04
as a seer you see all this going on
58:06
around you is i have to focus sometimes
58:08
when i go in a place because i'm seeing
58:10
all this
58:11
i'm seeing people's angels i'm seeing
58:13
demons that are trying to speak to
58:14
people they'll try to whisper things in
58:16
your ear that aren't gone that's being
58:18
influenced by one okay a possession is a
58:22
as a whole totally different thing they
58:23
probably can't even think on their own
58:26
or do normally even natural everyday
58:28
things needed for them to live in a
58:30
situation like that
58:33
you better know the power of god you
58:34
better not have sin in you and try to
58:36
cast a demon
58:38
you just need to know that's not going
58:40
to remember the seven sons of skiva go
58:41
back to the bible uh they thought
58:43
because they saw you know all of them
58:45
cast demons out they thought they could
58:47
do the same thing and the demon came out
58:49
and jumped on them i'm not trying to
58:50
scare you i'm just saying what's
58:51
biblical you can't live a life of sin
58:55
even as a christian which sounds crazy
58:57
and think you're going to cast demons
58:59
out they're going to come after you
59:02
so
59:02
if you're operating if you're operating
59:04
and righteously and you have authority
59:06
and you know you have authority and a
59:08
situation like that that would be the
59:09
most natural thing for me to say i cast
59:11
you out in jesus name get out
59:14
he had me do that in a whole
59:15
congregation and this whole massive
59:17
congregation of like 700 people three
59:20
demons literally ran out of the people
59:23
and those people were set free instantly
59:26
from the
59:27
the the the the demon that had
59:30
controlled them either they gave
59:32
themselves to it and i'm saying you
59:34
cannot just go play around in the
59:36
darkness people you should not have an
59:38
ouija board i am sorry that's how you
59:40
contact me you don't want one of those
59:42
you don't want to mess with witchcraft i
59:44
just have to be honest if you want to be
59:46
full of god in these days and walk in
59:49
great authority you don't have to be a
59:51
prophet to do that you do need to know
59:54
who you are in christ and who christ is
59:56
and you walk to please him you you have
59:59
authority over the darkness the bible
60:02
says so you do and there's a whole list
60:05
of things that you have the right to do
60:06
as a believer it doesn't have to be
60:09
necessarily a five-fold person in the
60:11
ministry you as a righteous person have
60:13
great authority in the earth
60:16
but you can't play in the enemy's camp
60:18
in other words you can't decide well i'm
60:20
a born-again believer you know i'm
60:21
operating i'm reading my word i'm i'm
60:23
declaring things and and then decide to
60:26
go to some wicked evil science party
60:30
a guest
60:32
and that guest you wouldn't want with
60:33
you i'm not talking about a physical one
60:35
so you need to you need to be
60:36
accountable for your life and actions
60:38
when you get to the age of
60:39
accountability
60:42
that means you know the difference and
60:43
you know what's right or wrong don't
60:45
play with the darkness
60:47
okay if you want to be safe and powerful
60:49
don't play with darkness um you just
60:52
don't want to do that and i don't even
60:53
know how we got into all that yeah but
60:55
as far as casting demons out we we have
60:58
authority to do that jesus those who
61:00
followed him believed in him who had
61:02
repented of the sins was living
61:04
righteously they had the right to do
61:05
that
61:06
and remember the one man he cast all the
61:08
demons out and prayed over him and then
61:09
he sent him to do the same thing because
61:11
he'd received christ
61:13
but you need to know who you are who
61:15
christ is who is christ
61:17
he made everything that ever existed
61:20
that does exist and will ever exist
61:22
that's who he is
61:24
when you give yourself to him you get
61:26
everything with him you're not giving up
61:29
your few little sins you had or you feel
61:31
little things you like to do and play in
61:34
you're getting a life eternal
61:36
to one day being immortal
61:38
and this is what you're giving yourself
61:40
to it's not just oh no i have to read a
61:42
bible it's not that it's who are you
61:45
giving yourself to because one way or
61:47
the other you're going to participate in
61:49
the darkness or you're going to be in
61:50
the light with jesus christ so i would
61:53
say
61:54
run after him
61:55
get along and say i want to know you
61:57
jesus i want to know you more i want to
61:58
know about you i'm going to be like you
62:01
you're going to start having his
62:02
presence show up because of what you're
62:04
saying okay
62:06
what you say matters in this world
62:09
and so don't be bashing trashing
62:12
swearing profanity is how's language
62:14
people i'm sorry i don't tolerate don't
62:16
ever swear about me don't swear around
62:18
me i'll cast that on you that's good all
62:21
right now i think i may know where this
62:23
came from but let's see okay so you said
62:25
you said in the past everything in
62:27
heaven is alive
62:29
the flowers don't die the grass is alive
62:31
things like that and this person may
62:33
have heard that but maybe i don't know
62:35
if you said the angels took care of the
62:37
flowers but this person says what do
62:39
angels have to do when they take care of
62:40
the flowers do they have to water weed
62:43
fertilize so i don't know what you might
62:45
have said did you say the angels take
62:47
care of them
62:48
okay so what did they do they care for
62:51
them uh they'll go and sing
62:54
they'll release the life of god
62:57
they'll go visit them i mean there's
62:59
there are some that their assignment and
63:01
there's some that care for the
63:02
waterfalls there's ones that care for
63:05
the meadows and the flowers and the
63:07
creatures
63:08
god doesn't have to feed them it's not
63:11
the physical food you're thinking on
63:14
you're connected to earth okay i'm
63:16
talking about heaven
63:17
the life of god feeds everything in
63:20
heaven you eat in heaven because you
63:22
love to eat you don't eat because you
63:24
have to do it to live
63:26
so these these things he made
63:28
that he imparts the life life of god or
63:32
joy they may bring waves of joy to whole
63:34
meadows and the flowers begin to sing
63:36
with joy so there's things that they're
63:38
assigned to do in heaven but it's never
63:40
going to be the fertilizer fertilizer
63:42
they're not going to dig and put plants
63:44
in there okay
63:46
uh if you're a gardener in heaven you'll
63:48
speak and plants will begin to come up
63:50
on the ground oh wow you're gardening
63:52
with your with your mouth
63:54
by speaking
63:55
new things
63:57
that's right very cool very cool very
63:59
cool um here's one i don't know if this
64:01
is a child or not but i know that's a
64:03
serious question but this is does anyone
64:06
go to heaven and not like it
64:10
and now do they what
64:13
no does anyone go to heaven
64:17
there is not one single person who's
64:19
ever moved to heaven and lived there
64:22
and not liked it okay there's so many
64:25
things i don't even have time to tell
64:27
about or share about that exist there
64:30
you're living in an atmosphere of joy
64:34
there's nothing in you that would
64:35
despise or not like it's not even in you
64:39
i know in your head you can't understand
64:41
that because i know you go to a store
64:43
and you go i don't like that outfit but
64:44
i like that one no i would never wear
64:46
that but i sure would like to own that
64:48
it isn't like that in heaven okay you
64:50
love everything you have your favorites
64:52
or you'll go to different places to get
64:54
favorite things that you like because
64:55
everything's just given to you things
64:57
are created to me but it's given to you
64:59
but you're not ever going to say i don't
65:01
like living here
65:03
that is impossible
65:05
you are so filled every bar
65:07
part of your being is filled with the
65:09
life and love of god and
65:11
if anything you love more
65:14
you love your family more you love god
65:16
more you love his house the world called
65:18
heaven you love everything about it you
65:20
get to go on tours and nothing costs
65:23
anything there's no money in heaven uh
65:25
everything is freely given people share
65:27
the gift that they are that they were on
65:29
the earth that only they use it in more
65:31
fantastic ways than they would like an
65:33
artist doesn't just have to paint on a
65:35
canvas their paint floats in the air
65:37
whatever they use to make things it's
65:38
just there they paint with light they
65:41
paint the sky of heaven and it's there
65:43
for a while then it fades and they paint
65:45
something else
65:46
there's no what there's no way you could
65:48
not love being there yeah that's amazing
65:50
all right let's do this this is the last
65:52
one but this is a good one um never
65:54
heard this one but this is this is to
65:56
you cat christie's asking on one of your
65:59
visits to heaven kat have you ever had a
66:02
family dinner with father son and holy
66:05
spirit what did the conversation can
66:07
sound like
66:09
i i've never had a dinner with all three
66:11
of them
66:12
i haven't
66:14
i have visited with them separately and
66:16
they've taken me different places in
66:18
heaven i've i've spent i not i don't
66:20
think i ever ate with any of them okay i
66:23
think i've been in a bakery with jesus
66:25
one time just because he was showing it
66:27
to me he loves sweets yeah every baker
66:30
that comes to heaven he's going to visit
66:31
their shop
66:34
really great i've been in the the i've
66:36
been in the um mansion that is jesus
66:39
christ has his own why wouldn't he he
66:42
lived on the earth as a person okay
66:44
he served god while he was here on the
66:46
earth he has his own yes he's in the
66:49
throne room a lot but he also has his
66:50
own place what does he do he throws
66:53
events there invites people just come
66:55
home to heaven and let them meet all the
66:56
prophets and all the stuff i've been
66:58
there and all he served was desserts
67:01
people so i hope you like dessert you
67:02
had every kind of dessert imaginable on
67:05
this glorious mansion
67:08
and when you walk through the flowers
67:10
are so high they're all greeting you
67:12
you come in this beautiful carriage
67:15
and then he sent for you to invite you
67:17
to his place and there's people there
67:19
you probably always wanted to meet if
67:21
you said i always wanted to meet elijah
67:23
i always wanted to meet queen esther i
67:24
wanted to see david they would
67:26
definitely be there for you and then you
67:28
would all enjoy desserts on these tables
67:31
and he's going to have dancing like
67:34
beautiful dancing and i know in your
67:36
mind you're thinking all these different
67:38
styles of dance depending on what you
67:39
like there's nothing defiling there's
67:41
nothing degrading in heaven but
67:43
beautiful um they dance all over heaven
67:46
all the time usually from joy from
67:47
celebration but everything you you
67:50
usually think about is equated to what
67:52
is in the what's in the in the um
67:55
i'm trying to think of an earth ward
67:57
right now
67:59
they would compromise the area this is
68:02
the best i could do of the throne room
68:05
and even that would be hard for you to
68:07
do if you have not been there the throne
68:08
room is alive it gets huge it grows it's
68:12
round the throne is in the middle of the
68:15
throne room it's high and lifted up
68:17
there's like platforms columns platforms
68:19
columns and there's people and all
68:20
different they're either worshiping or
68:22
dancing or leaving sweets for jesus
68:25
seriously all the way up the steps to
68:27
where this massive throne is the father
68:30
sits and his son sits next to him
68:32
uh you have to walk past these living
68:34
creatures that are so stunning
68:40
to get up there and your eyes cannot
68:42
contain
68:43
uh so it's not like there's little small
68:46
spaces and there's no place for you it's
68:48
not like that you begin to worship
68:49
everybody raises up off the floor the
68:51
seraphim come down out of the glory
68:53
cloud and they're on fire with passion
68:55
and love for them with sin on the throne
68:58
there's no way you couldn't love being
69:00
in this place and so anyone who has
69:02
someone there
69:03
don't ever feel sorry for them that
69:06
they're living
69:08
they're existing to live
69:11
you never die
69:12
there's no thoughts of death there's no
69:14
thoughts of harm nobody's ever sick
69:16
nobody lacks
69:18
everybody still wants to help one
69:19
another with their events and stuff like
69:21
that there's joy celebration no one is
69:23
rejected no one's rejected
69:26
everybody is cared about and loved
69:28
and and the creatures you also can get
69:31
to know all the creatures that they are
69:32
not talking about the living creatures
69:34
they're too busy i'm talking about
69:36
creatures all over the world called
69:38
heaven and the friendly forest is why
69:40
they call it that in the valley of the
69:42
falls uh
69:43
there's just so many beautiful places
69:45
and fun places i can't leave out the fun
69:48
okay
69:49
so no matter what when you know someone
69:51
who's going and you know they're going
69:53
i celebrate
69:55
and i've been celebrating over marcus
69:57
lamb recently
70:00
a great man and woman of god have gone
70:02
home to heaven my whole heart is so full
70:04
for them of the glory they will
70:06
experience just being in the presence um
70:09
of the father of the son
70:11
and holy spirit is still there people i
70:13
know his base of operations is on the
70:15
earth so don't even go there with me the
70:17
holy spirit is an unlay unlimited
70:20
layered being
70:21
i hope that does something to your
70:23
natural head
70:24
unlimited layers of himself doesn't mean
70:26
there's a million of them standing
70:27
around it's not like he's here there's a
70:29
million of them around him it's not like
70:30
that
70:31
the way that he is
70:33
he has unlimited layers of himself where
70:35
he sends that layer of him that looks
70:37
just like him and is him he knows
70:40
everything there here's everything there
70:42
so when you invite the holy spirit to
70:44
indwell you guess what you don't get a
70:46
piece of him you get a whole of him in
70:48
you that's good good good good
70:51
yeah so when the holy spirit you know
70:53
he's when the holy spirit lives in you
70:56
that's not some euphemism or poetry it
70:59
means he himself
71:02
is there uh we would we would use the
71:04
word in bodily form except he's a spirit
71:07
being so it's not and he's killed him as
71:09
a body
71:10
yeah okay so spiritual body
71:13
he's literally there the person of the
71:15
holy spirit you get hold of him to
71:18
indwell you and let me tell you he
71:20
almost never stops talking to me he
71:22
talks again a lot most of the time you
71:24
hear him like out here speaking to you
71:27
um and sometimes he'll even say oh don't
71:29
turn there or don't go there or stop uh
71:32
that's usually saying him saying that to
71:34
you
71:35
even if it's in your spirit you hear him
71:38
but if you give him permission i want i
71:40
want to end with this you if you're born
71:42
again
71:43
and you're not spirit filled invite holy
71:45
spirit to indwell you you really must
71:47
it's the power of god in you it gets you
71:50
bold the power of god now lives in you
71:54
and you have access to that and you can
71:56
you need to say to the holy spirit i
71:58
give you permission to talk to me even
72:01
when i'm not paying attention
72:04
and if you say those words to him he'll
72:06
do it when when needed to protect you
72:09
when needed to encourage you he will and
72:12
and then you'll be the more you
72:14
recognize he is there
72:16
uh i talk to him like i do to jesus or
72:18
the father
72:19
um i've seen the outline of his being
72:21
he's very powerful looking too he's
72:23
outlined in fire he carries the fire of
72:26
god uh on him he is god
72:30
and uh they have the ability to step
72:31
inside of each other i've already been
72:33
in the throne and saw the father sitting
72:35
there jesus gets up and steps inside the
72:36
father the holy spirit comes
72:38
wherever there goes that steps inside
72:40
the father
72:42
and then the three in one
72:44
wow oh wow
72:45
a five-year-old could understand that a
72:48
five-year-old can understand the trinity
72:51
and yet man in their natural mind still
72:53
trying to figure out do they have three
72:54
heads how does this work
72:58
and then they step out and there they
72:59
are the three individual gods the
73:02
godhead
73:03
but one thing is for sure they love you
73:06
they care about you and they don't
73:08
like the darkness
73:12
that's good that's so good
73:14
cat wow that's so so good so so so good
73:16
all right well we got about a third of
73:18
the way through the questions because
73:20
i'm just enjoying it takes it longer
73:22
than i love it i love the time we spend
73:24
with each one but you know it's going to
73:26
take us another couple hundred shows
73:33
yeah he made me he picked me he made me
73:36
first of all
73:37
if you can imagine i'm so full of detail
73:40
that's why i have a photographic memory
73:42
so i never forget anything i saw heard
73:44
or experienced but i grew up like really
73:46
really
73:47
i was really i was high maintenance
73:50
because i knew things no one else knew
73:54
and the family i knew things that my
73:55
siblings were doing they didn't want me
73:57
to know um but i also knew what god was
74:01
saying and um so i was not normal even
74:03
when i was little i ate once a day i
74:05
slept four hours a day i was up all
74:07
night long
74:08
uh even young my mom would still always
74:11
been this way i thought that was new in
74:13
your life you've always been that way
74:15
huh but i'm a detailed person which is
74:17
good for god but when you're with
74:19
somebody trying to be over a project
74:21
or you're out picking something up from
74:23
the store
74:24
you're detailed then too
74:26
you know i'm sure that sharpens my
74:28
husband no i don't want that one it has
74:29
to have this slant has this this hue
74:32
this this tent this
74:34
is not over here i don't want that and
74:36
so i'm like that too so you get both of
74:39
me you get all of that i but but it
74:41
works well with heaven
74:43
that's why yeah well i mean you're a
74:44
revelator but you have a photographic
74:46
memory and you are a photographer
74:48
because to boot you i don't know
74:50
the verb forget details and while you're
74:53
not forgetting natural details you're
74:54
seeing supernatural all around you at
74:56
all times yes and i can't even i can't
74:59
even you know your brain must be
75:03
i mean
75:05
it's like living in two worlds
75:07
at the same time can't you are you um
75:10
here's let me use human
75:12
you know
75:13
terminology language
75:15
yeah while you're remembering in a in
75:17
your photographic memory now you're
75:20
seeing demons and angels and things as
75:21
you walk around the room and this cruise
75:23
ship or whatever are you recording and
75:25
not forgetting what those as well
75:28
do you remember what which entities were
75:30
doing what how how far does their memory
75:33
go well when i'm on the ship they try to
75:35
not be
75:36
there oh they do
75:39
well they already know me because they
75:41
know that i have this relationship with
75:43
jesus christ they know
75:44
uh they already know who i am i have
75:47
they they they have
75:49
blacklisted me
75:50
because they could get cast out
75:53
uh or i could say something that would
75:55
freak them out you know the spirit or
75:57
whatever uh and i won't tolerate when i
76:00
get up in the morning say i'm not
76:01
tolerating any of the darkness anywhere
76:02
near me i take power over all the power
76:04
of the enemy command the host of heaven
76:06
you will shred mesh bash and trash every
76:08
demon that even tries to come near me
76:10
shred platforms that have been built in
76:11
the spirit realm and some of those were
76:13
on cruise ships because for for whatever
76:16
reason
76:17
uh people got away with certain things
76:19
and then there's these spiritual
76:20
platforms they would be destroyed if i
76:22
was on that ship wow so so they don't
76:25
have maybe as much activity because i'm
76:28
in a captive place and there are
76:31
captives already if i am there
76:34
that's good well you know that's that's
76:36
a thing in scripture whereas it was paul
76:38
paul i know and such and such i know but
76:40
i didn't know don't know you so they do
76:43
know the high level
76:45
uh apostles prophets just holy people
76:48
men and women and children yes they do
76:51
is it such that when they get on this
76:53
cruise ship
76:55
they have a meeting and everyone knows
76:56
where the holy people are on the ship
76:58
how does it go
77:00
it's because of how much light you have
77:02
coming out of you okay
77:05
i mean they already know people who
77:07
don't have christ
77:09
uh it's not like they're not living
77:10
obviously their body's living but their
77:12
spirit man really doesn't have a lot of
77:14
life in it and sometimes they may follow
77:16
those people to see if they can get them
77:18
pulled into something but i take
77:20
authority over the whole ship
77:23
wow
77:24
wow
77:25
wow
77:26
yeah boy i would love to hear that you
77:28
know i'd love to go to heaven one day
77:29
and see what happened but i guess
77:31
the evil you don't see the evil replayed
77:34
that someone won i mean right
77:36
if you go to heaven you know the only
77:37
time you might see something like that
77:39
is if he allows you to see what your
77:41
prayers resulted in war without heaven
77:44
against the enemy i think he probably
77:46
it's not like it would really be there
77:48
it would be something that you would get
77:50
to see happen like in your life when
77:53
you're praying and you were praying for
77:54
somebody i think you do get to see the
77:57
destruction that your prayers called
77:59
calls again the enemy the spiritual
78:01
darkness i'd love to see that so i'd
78:03
like to see that now all right cat
78:05

78:06

80:38
going to say i will not tell you to go
80:39
give to some missionary camp those
80:41
people are trying to steal money from
80:42
you or they're saying that i said to
80:44
give to this group or for this cause
80:47
that's not me and i don't do it on
80:48
purpose because i don't want people
80:50
getting ripped off yeah so go to
80:52
category.com if you want to give and i
80:54
do want to end with this make sure you
80:56
are supporting elijah's an elijah
80:59
streams thank you like steve said they
81:03
they can't know every single person they
81:05
put on there but they do know if they
81:08
find out someone's not living right
81:10
that's what they're saying we're not
81:11
going to put them on there they're not
81:13
going to even promote them i wouldn't
81:14
either and sometimes people go through
81:17
stages of their life where they're not
81:18
hearing right or whatever reason
81:21
but i tell you god calls him a platform
81:24
for the prophets to speak for him
81:27
and if he cares about steve and he put
81:31
that in place then that is something
81:33
that is definitely valid to give to your
81:35
seating into the lives of millions of
81:38
people when you give to him and helping
81:40
to support his staff and future projects
81:43
like going to israel
81:46
if he ever does another tour of israel
81:47
make sure you get to go on that tour
81:49
it's amazing
81:50
and so many things we do
81:53
we speak for god we're not god but we
81:55
speak for him we allow him to speak
81:58
uh the best we possibly can because we
82:00
want you to know him want you to know
82:02
the truth the truth makes you free
82:05
not lies and deception so you have a
82:08
blessed day and yeah thank you kent i
82:10
think days definitely never stop
82:12
declaring declaration declaration is
82:15
still prayer declaring declaring and
82:17
decreeing over situations is still
82:19
prayer it's a really high level of
82:21

03:48
many people there are have not been

introduced to that and many people that
03:52
go there are not even saved but so
03:55
trying to figure out
03:57
from the lord which what are the best
03:59
things to say and show and tell
04:01
so that people can be initiated into the
04:03
prophetic so prayer is appreciated all
04:05
right let's bring kerr in here
04:08
hi
04:09
hi cat i guess for you it's good
04:11
afternoon it's about two to something
04:13
your time huh
04:15
yeah it's a little bit past morning for
04:17
me morning is noon
04:18
[Laughter]
04:20
yeah and it's about eleven
04:22
i guess we're yeah you're exactly three
04:24
hours ahead but well welcome to the
04:25
broadcast as you yeah as always uh
04:28
you're looking chipper as always so you
04:29
guys are still gonna are gonna move very
04:32
soon right to new offices or a new home
04:34
or what we're moving to a new home first
04:37
and after that uh margaret's already
04:39
been looking for office building we
04:41
can't start up with just something small
04:43
we we've gotten so huge inside where
04:45
we're at now
04:47
and so we're moving out first so we'll
04:49
be out all of our stuff will be out
04:51
because you know we've been
04:52
living here for 15 years actually where
04:55
we're at but the office took over about
04:58
six and a half years ago and then it
04:59
fastly it took over every room in in
05:02
this place so we call it the office not
05:04
even our home right now but we will be
05:06
moving
05:08
very shortly and then probably within a
05:10
few months after that we'll be moving
05:11
our offices yeah wow well you've really
05:14
been in a growth spurt so have we i mean
05:16
this year we
05:17
you and i saw a lot of growth didn't we
05:20
that was amazing and he would have grown
05:22
about the same time we did so we we just
05:24
kind of did it together didn't we
05:26
we did do it together it was god's plan
05:29
yeah it was it really really was we both
05:32
know it we both felt it we're both
05:34
experiencing it now so yeah well um go
05:37
ahead
05:38
go ahead people should understand i know
05:40
if you look around only at the world
05:43
what the world is seeing or even this
05:45
nation like i would say everyday people
05:48
uh a lot of people who are prophetic or
05:50
who just really prayer warriors
05:52
understand god's about to do something
05:54
powerful
05:55
and that's why the enemy is showing
05:57
himself off but as god says he's only
06:00
exposing himself people that's probably
06:02
as far as i'll go about that the enemy's
06:04
been exposing himself this whole last
06:06
year and a half and that makes them an
06:08
easy target
06:09
for god of course you know i'm talking
06:11
about god the god of heaven and earth
06:14
and he continued tells me
06:16
um that i have to be prepared for the
06:18
acceleration will be very quickly after
06:21
major things begin to happen
06:24
we want to keep this broadcast on here
06:26
so uh but you know i've been talking
06:28
about that all along people who've been
06:30
listening all along i'm so grateful for
06:32
your support for your prayers i know
06:34
steve is but god did actually plan this
06:36
together because it all started way back
06:38
you know back in 2019 this whole thing
06:41
kind of started what we're doing now
06:43
and um and god just knows what he's
06:45
doing that's what i can say i in my
06:48
spirit have so much celebration and
06:50
excitement in me i was with god last
06:53
night and my office right now is so
06:56
filled with him uh in here i i can't
06:59
help but have excitement on the inside
07:01
because that's that's how he feels and
07:03
so he says i have to have you into a
07:05
bigger place for you and your offices
07:08
have to be established uh so we're not
07:10
margaret i think we're thinking about
07:11
something smaller and god said no you're
07:13
gonna accelerate very quickly once you
07:15
leave here personally and when you leave
07:18
here in the offices it's it's about to
07:20
be very great these are great days for
07:23
people they're not the sad
07:26
fearful days
07:27
and you know speaking of how this all
07:29
happened to both of us this year i it's
07:31
very clear to me that
07:33
you know i call god one of his my names
07:35
for him is you know that's not like i
07:38
say dear manager but one of his
07:40
descriptions to me is he's a manager
07:41
i've asked him to manage my life and so
07:44
he literally withholds i mean he's
07:47
blessing the socks off of both of us but
07:49
he could do it he could even double it
07:51
right now but he knows you need that
07:52
often so he needs you to get into that
07:54
office into the home and until he just
07:56
goes
07:57
and it'll double triple quadruple you
07:59
know so yeah it will this is this is the
08:02
air this is the time and season and
08:04
years and breakthroughs where people are
08:07
need to hear the prophet's voice do you
08:09
sense that after the switch after the
08:12
right person is back in office
08:16
do you expect that people will need at
08:18
that point to have more prophetic words
08:20
or less prophetic words
08:22
i think they're going to begin to run
08:24
after the true prophetic
08:27
word of god that has been proven through
08:29
all of this that we've been going
08:30
through i already happen to know they
08:32
are literally going to run after people
08:34
to be near them to hear them it's going
08:36
to increase and not just that steve
08:39
salvations will begin to increase
08:42
greatly
08:43
not because it's the last day where
08:45
we're all out of here this is god
08:48
preparing for what's about to happen for
08:50
several generations of i know this also
08:53
that a lot of uh prophets are being born
08:56
right now as we speak uh in of course as
08:59
babies but they are prophets and god is
09:01
about to flood this world with the
09:04
prophetical and prophets so i hope
09:06
they're ready for that and i do know as
09:09
a parent who kind of raised one and
09:12
who's now a mentoring grandchildren who
09:14
are prophets wow they're not normal they
09:17
don't start out normal and they're going
09:19
to be very powerful let's say 10 20
09:22
years from now there'll be such powerful
09:24
voices in the earth we do need you steve
09:26
we do need the elijah's elijah streams
09:29
will be a known door opening for those
09:32
prophets who are really hearing god and
09:35
are living the life
09:36
it's going to happen we can't stop it
09:39
from happening
09:40
no one not anyone not spiritual or
09:42
physical in this realm or in the unseen
09:45
realm can stop from god from doing what
09:48
he's going to do you know and when god
09:51
god began to birth prophets even out in
09:53
the desert with moses to the extent that
09:56
a couple people started prophesying he
09:57
didn't have permission and they were
09:59
cattle on to moses and he goes what are
10:01
you jealous from my account he says what
10:03
that all god's people who are prophets
10:04
this whole desire and moses was himself
10:07
a prophet but he said with it all god's
10:09
people were prophets that was desire and
10:12
you know on on the amount of
10:13
transfigurations it was
10:16
moses the prophet he was also a little
10:18
law giver and he loved the prophet and
10:20
god you know what moses did on the earth
10:23
was important for him to say that was
10:25
super significant so
10:26
yeah well you know uh we're we're going
10:28
to jump into some questions about heaven
10:30
and related things anything else so make
10:32
sure we're giving you a chance to say
10:33
anything you were going to say before we
10:35
jump into those oh no that was it just
10:38
this acceleration that's going to happen
10:40
is why a lot of people i i'll just
10:43
repeat what god said
10:44
uh one day it will be hard to remember
10:48
these days we just went through except
10:50
the powerful part except the god part of
10:53
them uh we'll be doing so many powerful
10:55
things and you know it is god's heart
10:58
that all prophesy it says that that all
11:01
prophesied and my heart is everyone
11:04
knows the truth the truth comes from you
11:07
know jesus christ
11:08
he's the spirit of truth we know holy
11:10
spirit we know the father who all
11:12
revelation flows from it is there and
11:15
i'll just say there their heart that we
11:17
all know truth that we all hear him and
11:20
receive revelation because of the days
11:22
coming and all the flood of people
11:24
coming into the kingdom we'll have to
11:27
mentor them not
11:28
we not just me but the body of christ
11:30
will have to be at a level where they
11:32
can mentor these people uh coming on
11:34
board into the body of christ that's
11:36
good well
11:37
we're in it together this will be fun so
11:39
a lot of people if you're new and you've
11:41
not seen cat before cat over the last 20
11:43
some years maybe more a lot more than
11:46
that he has been to heaven and
11:48
thousands of times would that be about
11:49
accurate thousands of times that is very
11:52
accurate
11:53
so uh and i think one of my favorite
11:55
little clips from memory is he is a
11:58
visit to heaven might be you're in a
12:00
grocery store picking up a can of food
12:02
or something off the shelf by the time
12:04
you put your hand back down into the
12:06
basket you've been to heaven and back
12:08
and and they counter like
12:10
that might last how long and
12:13
how long would it seem a visit like that
12:16
lasted when you were there i think the
12:18
only way i can gauge that because they
12:20
don't have clocks in heaven anybody
12:22
there's no calendars or clocks in heaven
12:24
uh god does things according to events
12:28
actually his whole timeline that he has
12:30
behind his throne and embedded in the
12:31
floor of the throne is god's timeline
12:34
but it's done by events
12:36
that are planned down the earth it's not
12:38
like i know the hebrew calendar you can
12:40
tell me all about that that's still the
12:41
earth thing i'm talking about a heavenly
12:42
from a heavenly viewpoint god has events
12:46
already playing out he's already seen
12:47
him he's been there he already knows uh
12:49
what's gonna happen it's up to us to
12:51
choose to be a part of it but i only
12:53
know if i've been there uh a while is
12:56
how many places he shows me like if he
12:58
catches me up and he's talking to me
13:00
about a specific topic
13:02
or uh an event and then he shows it to
13:05
me he'll take me forward in time to show
13:07
me that event so i can talk very clearly
13:09
about the things that he's shown me and
13:11
then brings me back it probably wasn't
13:13
very long earth time um if i've taken to
13:16
three or four places which he can do and
13:19
with no time in heaven he can totally do
13:21
that but i realize while i've been there
13:24
for a while all those seconds in the
13:26
store have gone by i've been taking the
13:29
three four or even five places in heaven
13:31
that literally exists
13:33
and i could draw a map of those places i
13:35
literally could i've actually done that
13:36
a few times just for my
13:38
for myself i've actually drawn what's
13:40
around certain things in certain areas
13:42
of heaven
13:43
but one day we plan to have huge
13:45
displays
13:46
not just in our offices but we'll have
13:48
other places and um facilities where we
13:51
actually people can come and see things
13:53
happening as they when it looked like
13:55
when they happened in heaven what
13:56
happened literally looks like to walk
13:57
through it so it's a good thing i have
14:00
photographic memory yeah for sure for
14:02
sure by the way someone asked me a
14:04
question about your photographic memory
14:06
uh my my wife's
14:08
brother kind of has that and i'm sure
14:10
there's there's
14:11
there are degrees of photographic memory
14:14
does that mean that you never forget
14:17
anything or are there a certain type of
14:18
thing you always tend to remember it but
14:20
you can forget other things what does
14:22
that mean in your case
14:24
if it is regarding heaven i've never
14:26
forgotten any single time i've been
14:28
taken okay wow
14:31
wow wow
14:32
you could even identify that on that
14:34
particular trip you went down at the
14:36
different places i can i can't identify
14:38
it what it felt like what the aromas i
14:40
smelled uh the flavors i tasted uh what
14:44
the atmosphere was like what what what
14:46
it looked like what it felt like um what
14:49
other places what people were
14:51
experiencing there how they felt about
14:52
things how relationships happen how
14:54
transportation happens how heaven
14:56
operates
14:58
i could just go on and on because
15:00
he has shown me he sent me as a
15:02
revelator of heaven that's his title he
15:04
gave me and he takes me whenever he
15:07
wants to and i never say no
15:10
wow yeah i love that i love that
15:12
okay well let's jump into some questions
15:14
about heaven and these are some are
15:15
questions about heaven and others are
15:17
questions about things you understand
15:19
about the word because god's explained
15:22
it in heavenly language
15:24
okay we usually do a couple of kids once
15:26
this one there's a one by a child and
15:27
one by a young man so here's the my
15:30
grandson i don't know his age deborah
15:31
says my grandson wants to know
15:34
if dinosaur dinosaurs have feathers
15:37
and are there bright colors in heaven so
15:39
that's his son i don't have the
15:41
grandson's name
15:42
well i can start with the colors there's
15:44
colors in heaven that don't exist on the
15:46
earth
15:47
everything we have here is a shadow of
15:50
what is in heaven
15:52
and i always like every time i say that
15:53
the holy spirit makes me say this on
15:55
purpose that heaven is a world that's
15:57
round
15:58
like the earth is round
16:00
and he is adamant about saying it's not
16:02
flat and i know some people don't
16:03
understand that there's a whole group
16:05
out there the flat earth society
16:08
uh they think they can figure that out
16:10
and i went well they're not god and they
16:12
didn't make it and i happen to know that
16:14
it says that he sits above the circle of
16:16
the earth and i guess they think that's
16:17
a flat circle i don't know the holy
16:20
spirit always wants me to bring that up
16:22
because there's people who are in that
16:23
and really believe it and uh but i'm
16:26
telling you the earth is round it is a
16:28
world uh the father's house is a world
16:32
it's not just a building
16:34
and so whatever he makes or comes from
16:36
his being one of the things that comes
16:38
from his being is the rainbow and i tell
16:41
people if you want to see what it looks
16:42
like go watch the northern lights or
16:44
find it online the northern lights it's
16:46
not just a stagnant rainbow in other
16:49
words it doesn't just sit on him like
16:50
this it moves in and out in waves the
16:54
different uh layers of that rainbow and
16:56
anything it touches will turn that color
16:59
and so let me tell you everything you
17:01
would never expect trees can be teal
17:03
color uh they can be pink they could be
17:05
gold
17:07
creatures they're different colors so
17:09
yes there are vivid very beautiful
17:12
colors in heaven all over heaven there
17:15
are some dinosaurs that have wings and
17:17
some of them have feathers in them some
17:19
aren't some are made out of whatever
17:21
whatever substance he made them out of
17:23
but they're totally his dinosaurs he
17:25
made them i want to add again the holy
17:27
spirit says please tell them they didn't
17:28
come from hell there's this thing called
17:30
reptilian seed i don't know where that
17:32
came from i've never heard god say it he
17:34
made the dinosaurs he put him on the
17:36
earth the first time he made it
17:39
wow oh good good good okay now this is a
17:41
young man his name is elijah and people
17:43
have different questions that i wouldn't
17:45
have this question hopefully i'm going
17:46
to turn to it and the question is
17:49
do people blink in heaven now that
17:51
wouldn't be mine but he wants to know if
17:52
people blink
17:54
i'm pretty sure they do blink you still
17:56
have your eyelids in heaven your
17:58
spiritual body looks like you except
18:01
better better meaning if you were older
18:03
you're going to look young there's is
18:06
filled with the life of god you do kind
18:07
of glow a little bit uh people do kind
18:10
of glow in their spiritual body but you
18:12
can clearly see that's who that person
18:14
is you recognize him it says in heaven
18:16
you'll be known as you were known
18:17
there's a scripture and so it's not like
18:19
you become some little wispy thing
18:22
you're living in a spiritual world that
18:25
has substances it's almost like being
18:27
here but better
18:28
okay no darkness there of any kind but
18:31
you have a life you have a mansion you
18:32
live in the mansion you eat food you you
18:35
wear different clothing um so i forgot
18:39
what the question was
18:40
yeah
18:44
oh you will blink you will blink when
18:46
you see some of the things he's put up
18:48
there i mean a lot of people are like
18:49
they're like this
18:52
i mean you still have emotions you don't
18:55
have you know like fear you know or
18:57
anger or stuff like that but you have a
18:59
lot of you get excited and intensely
19:01
excited and undone and overwhelmed
19:04
because of the wonder and the splendor
19:06
which you're not going to ever find out
19:08
what that means to you go there so yes
19:10
people definitely blink
19:12
they blink they laugh i mean they laugh
19:14
a lot in heaven and they get overwhelmed
19:17
and undone by the goodness of god by the
19:19
waves of love that penetrate every bit
19:21
of heaven up there so it's just an
19:24
amazing place to live i will say this
19:27
again what jesus said tell everybody on
19:29
earth you have to make a living in order
19:31
to exist but in heaven you actually
19:34
exist to live to live you know my wife
19:37
and i said this all the time we said
19:39
that when we went to her parents
19:40
memorial they both passed away within a
19:42
week of each other in october
19:44
we both said since we know cat
19:48
and what we've learned about heaven our
19:49
entire
19:52
how to a demeanor at someone's death our
19:55
understanding is so much different
19:57
there's so much less grief there's so
19:59
much joy when our loved ones go go to be
20:02
with the lord because this is a
20:04
beautiful place yes their
20:06
body is here
20:07
they're reading means they're buried we
20:09
buried the dead we bury their remains
20:12
but they're not there they're with the
20:13
lord if they're if they're safe so it's
20:15
an entirely different thing and cat you
20:17
know i've never even thanked you as much
20:19
as i want to thank you for for changing
20:22
are
20:23
just giving us the truth you people
20:24
don't know you've actually paid a price
20:26
to do this so
20:27
we appreciate that we do appreciate that
20:29
very much all right now this is an
20:31
acquaintance of my
20:34
think i'd be better just read it because
20:35
it rather than try and tell it so here
20:37
it goes and this is from oh dear holly
20:41
he goes i had a question
20:43
for you or for cat i was wondering when
20:45
we pray over areas like for me it's
20:48
praying over ohio and indiana against
20:51
tornadoes do we need to be called
20:54
to a certain area or can we pray over
20:56
any area the reason i ask is because i
20:59
felt led to pray over my two states and
21:01
have since i was very young but i
21:02
remember and she names the name of a
21:04
teacher
21:05
a prophetic teacher he said i remember
21:07
years ago this teacher saying
21:09
you're asking for trouble my paraphrase
21:12
she said
21:13
if you pray over territories that you're
21:15
not called to pray over
21:18
which i did after kentucky got hit so
21:20
hard by tornadoes in december
21:22
they stopped at the ohio border i prayed
21:25
for iowa and minnesota when they were
21:27
expecting an outbreak of tornadoes and
21:30
immediately after that i got covered
21:33
so she's wondering did she do that to
21:35
herself because she prayed over a state
21:37
that she didn't have authority over
21:39
that had nothing to do with you
21:42
except you probably terrified the enemy
21:43
by doing it any believer
21:47
has the right to be over the weather i
21:49
will say this
21:51
the area you live in the state that you
21:54
live in you have a greater level of
21:56
authority but you really can take
21:58
authority and i do want to remind you
22:00
the holy spirit again is saying
22:01
something to me said remind them jesus
22:04
was in the storm when he stopped it
22:08
so you have greater authority wherever
22:10
you are present
22:12
so no matter what state you're in if
22:14
you're present when something comes up
22:15
you totally have the right to take
22:17
authority over that system that storm uh
22:20
there's nothing wrong with that jesus
22:22
was definitely over the weather no
22:23
matter where he went and when we were in
22:26
israel i spoke and dispelled the fog
22:28
that they said would be there for 25
22:29
minutes around the boat and i spoke and
22:31
within minutes it was gone i know i have
22:34
authority over it then me would like to
22:35
think you don't and people who've never
22:37
learned this
22:38
or even searched out what it said about
22:40
that you should understand that that
22:44
jesus is an example of what we can do
22:47
that's why he did these miracles it
22:48
wasn't just so he could be known
22:50
it was so that we also could step into
22:53
that place like him walking the
22:55
authority he gave us
22:57
if we have power over all the power of
22:59
the darkness and the enemy the enemy
23:01
causes severe weather that's not a
23:04
natural thing and i know the scientists
23:06
would say it was but what they're not
23:08
right they don't know understand the
23:10
spiritual side of things or the unseen
23:12
realm uh whatever you will take
23:14
authority over and of course you're not
23:16
giving yourself to the darkness i have
23:17
to add that you can't play an enemy's
23:19
camp and sin all the time and think you
23:22
have authority over anything
23:24
you you know there's a reason why jesus
23:26
said to walk a certain way
23:28
and if you walk in the spirit that means
23:30
you're aware of it of what's going on uh
23:32
you know you have authority in it and
23:34
you operate in that authority you can
23:37
you can make an effect on any severe
23:39
weather no matter what it is wherever
23:40
you are personally but other than that
23:43
where you live like floor is my greatest
23:45
level of authority although now he
23:47
actually says i speak worldwide about
23:49
things myself and and that that person i
23:52
think that said you were asking for
23:53
trouble that may have been he may have
23:55
been talking about the demonic hierarchy
23:58
like spirits of wickedness in high
24:00
places over certain areas he maybe they
24:02
meant that uh i know there's a thumb now
24:05
taking authorities over principles and
24:07
powers you better have holy spirit with
24:09
you and listen to the protocol you go
24:11
through to do that but i'm just talking
24:13
about right now about the weather any
24:15
weather system that would be destructive
24:17
you absolutely and you proved that by
24:19
what you did and we have way too many
24:22
testimonies that we we know
24:24
that we have the right to stop storms
24:26
shred storms or even shred them and
24:29
lower them and send them to places like
24:31
that need rain we've been doing that
24:33
this last year
24:35
well you know um that
24:37
that begs this question which you
24:39
actually just addressed is if someone
24:41
let's say it's not the weather and i'm
24:43
thinking of a friend of mine david he's
24:45
with the lord now but he told me years
24:47
and years this is like 30 years ago 30
24:49
40 years ago he was
24:51
in new york and he decided he was going
24:53
to take on the principality over new
24:54
york city and he was a seer he was a
24:57
singer so he saw it
24:59
and he came after this thing and he goes
25:00
i know you know he took a you know
25:02
within a couple minutes the car was
25:04
stopped he was arrested for some
25:06
trumped-up charge and put in jail he
25:08
said i'll never do that again so is that
25:10
what you're talking about he took
25:12
authority where he didn't have authority
25:13
and it was like
25:15
almost arrogant that he could do that
25:16
right if it is you know i was contacted
25:19
by very high level people
25:22
in the intercessory
25:23
arena and asked because you know six
25:27
times he has had me
25:29
through his protocol unseat
25:30
principalities i never once on my own
25:34
would even think to approach them you
25:36
know anything attacking me anything
25:38
coming against me or my family in the
25:40
demonic arena or in the arena i
25:42
absolutely have authority over that but
25:44
principalities and powers are very very
25:46
high level uh demons they don't live in
25:49
hell they sit on thrones over regions
25:51
where there's a lot of darkness and
25:53
there is a protocol to do it but you
25:55
better know what that is and god usually
25:57
will appoint me and tell me to go there
25:59
and what to do about it so i would not
26:02
and these people in high places on the
26:04
earth said how did you do that and not
26:06
die because they know people who died
26:08
they try to do so sometimes it's more
26:10
serious than just you think well i'm
26:12
over all of this and i can be uh you
26:14
know i can tear down the high things
26:16
and uh i wouldn't try to do that if you
26:19
don't have a lot of maturity in you
26:20
you're not hearing what god is saying
26:23
um i think you know depending on what he
26:26
did when he was in new york city he may
26:28
have been arrested just by if he's
26:29
getting out standing and yelling and
26:31
stuff like that as something out in the
26:32
public that may have been the reason why
26:35
that happened but i totally would not go
26:37
against something that god didn't tell
26:39
me to i'm not afraid of it i just am
26:41
wise
26:42
and so yeah people have died from doing
26:45
that and so i do have spirit realm boot
26:47
camp every year twice a year and uh if
26:50
you hear me doing that somewhere you
26:51
should come because then you understand
26:53
the operations of the spirit realm uh
26:55
different levels i don't run around
26:57
naming demons you know i don't just
26:58
don't do that i just take authority
27:00
where i don't where i want authority
27:02
but the special commission to go and do
27:04
something i have to follow exactly what
27:07
he's saying and it does happen but it's
27:10
not like i do that all the time so i
27:12
would definitely tell people don't step
27:14
out on your own power and your own
27:16
understanding of who you are think that
27:19
you can pull down those high places
27:21
there is a protocol but if you don't
27:24
know the protocol i would encourage to
27:25
do it but so that's what i did i
27:28
followed god's protocol
27:30
in 2000 my wife and i went to we were
27:32
offered to speak at a place in nigeria
27:36
and one of the evening
27:38
is there's 15 000 pastors and leaders
27:40
from africa at this place in
27:42
north area
27:44
and they decided to tell the whole
27:46
group that they were going to take on
27:48
and they started talking about the god
27:49
of the moon and blah blah blah and i
27:50
turned to our intercessor uh lisa she
27:53
was also see her i said is this okay for
27:55
us to do and she goes i wouldn't do this
27:57
at all so we just kept our mouth shut
28:00
let them do what they were gonna do i
28:02
didn't feel like they had authority
28:04
i don't think i and i didn't have the
28:05
authority it wasn't false humility it
28:07
was like
28:08
no there's no way i'm gonna
28:10
dance on this i got sick after that trip
28:12
as it was you know and i didn't
28:15
so anyway we got to be you got to
28:16
respect that
28:18
i think it's jude that says even even
28:20
michael the archangel didn't cast a
28:22
railing judgment against satan but said
28:24
the lord rebuked you so even there were
28:26
certain respect of the high level so all
28:29
right yeah so the weather
28:31
clearly
28:32
and i don't teach people how to get
28:33
protocols they don't ask me yeah that's
28:35
god wants you to go put on principality
28:37
he will tell you the protocol on how to
28:39
do that but as far as the there are
28:41
different levels in the darkness just
28:43
like those different levels and there's
28:45
different levels in business different
28:46
levels in the in the christian world uh
28:49
the medical field you wouldn't send
28:51
someone who's an intern to go do open
28:52
heart surgery would you and that's kind
28:55
of what you're doing if you think you
28:56
can go up without any authority remember
28:59
the seven sons of skiva let's just go
29:00
back to the bible and they saw you know
29:02
peter paul casting out demons they
29:04
thought they were going to go try it
29:06
they didn't have any authority
29:07
themselves that hadn't been walking in
29:09
that authority increasing that authority
29:11
and that demon tore them up so
29:13
there you go in the bible
29:16
you have to know what you're doing peter
29:17
and paul weren't attacked they weren't
29:19
assaulted they knew exactly what to do
29:20
and how to do it and they had walked
29:23
in that for some time in their life so
29:26
it's probably a good subject to bring up
29:28
because in these days of course there's
29:30
stuff everywhere you're seeing and
29:32
there's a big difference in trying to
29:33
take authority over a person doing
29:35
something wicked and in the spirit realm
29:37
maybe we'll do another whole session on
29:39
just that that would be important but
29:41
yeah um
29:42
people who are wicked in the natural
29:45
the reason they're like that is there
29:46
are demons around them affecting and
29:48
controlling them we can speak against
29:51
that part of it but i wouldn't uh
29:53
there's nowhere in the bible that i saw
29:55
where it said go attack people in the
29:56
natural
29:58
so even sending the host
30:01
even sending the host if you know
30:03
there's a person over here that's being
30:04
affected by demons and you say i'm
30:06
sending the host to take out the demons
30:08
that are causing him
30:10
that's one thing versus i come against
30:13
the principality that's that's
30:14
empowering those demons don't do that
30:16
right
30:18
well uh i think you can send the host
30:20
anywhere that you're impressed to send
30:22
them
30:23
and if they have authority from god to
30:25
do it then he'll allow them to do it and
30:29
if if he hasn't given them because even
30:31
they have different levels of authority
30:33
the army of heaven i'm talking about
30:35
because if you remember
30:38
you know even gabriel had to send for
30:39
michael for help going back to the
30:41
second thing you were talking about
30:43
he couldn't face these high-level demons
30:47
coming to bring that message to daniel
30:49
he couldn't do it himself he called for
30:50
michael when michael showed up let me
30:52
tell you i promise you they left okay
30:54
michael's not going to come in through
30:56
all your peers people just so you know
30:57
that
30:58
but anyway there are levels in every
31:01
type of army the natural army the
31:03
darkness the light and so um you need to
31:06
understand some of that stuff before you
31:08
try to go into that but sending the host
31:11
if you feel impressed to send them to
31:12
certain places if they have been given
31:14
the right by god to take down those
31:16
things they will
31:18
but the other things that they can do to
31:20
protect you to keep you
31:22
to pull down evil spirits in cities and
31:24
around areas if you have family there or
31:27
friends
31:29
or god has signed us on you to pray for
31:31
a certain area of things are going on
31:33
you definitely can send the army there
31:35
to pull down strongholds uh that's
31:37
different those are still the demonic it
31:39
says that our weapons they are minded to
31:42
the pulling down and strongholds that's
31:44
still the demonic that's still the dark
31:46
army but the the weapons one of those is
31:49
the army of heaven and so there are
31:51
certain things they automatically know
31:53
they can do and take care of um don't
31:55
let that stop you from starting to be
31:58
involved with the commanding the army of
32:00
heaven right now in this time they're
32:02
set but you have to know what you're
32:03
doing okay you still have to know what
32:05
you're doing and even what is the
32:07
purpose of your own heart are you doing
32:10
it yeah and i've heard you talk a lot
32:12
for the very first time i ever heard you
32:14
talk publicly you cautioned and exhorted
32:16
and warned
32:18
and taught people you better not have
32:20
sin in your life if you're doing some of
32:21
these things number one they're not
32:23
going to sit there and fold your hands i
32:24
think i recall you know you tell them
32:34
the word says that um
32:36
the army of heaven the host is the army
32:40
they're always called the host in the
32:42
bible the host hearken unto the word of
32:45
the lord why would they do that because
32:46
he's the lord of hosts jesus is over the
32:50
entire army of heaven no matter where
32:52
they're sent he is involved with that
32:54
they hearken under what he says so if
32:56
you're not talking
32:58
powerfully you're not talking in the
33:00
word in the word pray praying if you
33:03
don't have a strong relationship with
33:05
jesus christ hearing him clearly about
33:08
things some things like if you want to
33:10
send the army to go attack someone down
33:12
the street you don't like them you don't
33:13
like that they're loud noisy or crazy or
33:15
whatever
33:16
that army number one's never going to
33:18
attack humans
33:20
so that's why you have to speak as if
33:22
the lord would be saying it then they
33:24
will do what you're saying it is it is
33:27
also there's requirements to do have
33:29
authority and operate in it or we'd have
33:31
just chaos everywhere against everything
33:34
even heaven does have an order and
33:36
protocol is the best way to say that
33:38
their army operates by protocol like the
33:40
earth's army can't take orders from just
33:43
anybody you know the military can't they
33:45
have to take from those who have the
33:46
authority to give the orders and those
33:49
people have to operate even in the
33:50
military in a certain way to be able to
33:53
to head up our military uh some
33:56
private's not gonna run out there and
33:58
start yelling at the generals on people
33:59
to give orders in the in the natural
34:01
army well the same thing happens in the
34:04
spiritual army so you definitely need to
34:06
have a greater understanding of what you
34:08
think you're going to take down all of
34:10
hell
34:12
along the lines of the host you've
34:14
taught and shown pictures and all of
34:16
that about hosts that impress themselves
34:18
in cloud formation so that you can see
34:20
that they're there okay so
34:23
if someone's watching this today and
34:25
they've never heard that i just wanted
34:26
to say that part but this person says
34:28
every time i look into the sky i see or
34:31
seem to see a dragon in the clouds are
34:33
there hosts that look like dragons
34:37
yes there are they're called aragons
34:40
loki wow
34:41
and they they ride the host sometimes
34:45
we'll ride them let me get a drink i'm
34:46
talking a lot
34:51
um the hosts are transported to the
34:53
earth to do battle in many different
34:55
forms
34:56
one of the ways they love to do is they
34:59
ride the air guns the air guns are
35:00
actually part of the host they're not
35:03
just a ride they actually wore
35:05
themselves against some of the other
35:06
demonic part of the army but i actually
35:09
have a picture of some of them writing
35:11
i'm going to be posting some new
35:12
pictures or
35:14
maybe do a i don't know a host id
35:16
workshop somehow uh online and let
35:19
people know um but i actually have
35:22
pictures real pictures not doctored up
35:24
pictures you're talking to someone who's
35:26
clueless about
35:27
anything on the web or even doing stuff
35:29
or art i am a photographer old school
35:31
taking pictures you know with my film
35:33
camera and stuff like that
35:35
i can't i couldn't in any way nor do i
35:38
have time to learn how to fix things or
35:40
change things
35:41
uh the pictures i take are legit the
35:44
real god sends them i take the pictures
35:46
and he allows me to show them
35:48
but there are some called eragons and i
35:49
have a powerful one i think it was in
35:52
the calendar we did on the host
35:54
coming in and i was actually in the
35:56
store this big um
35:58
parking lot where there's like i don't
36:00
know on office max and michael's and
36:02
other things and it's a great big open
36:05
area so it's a good year to go and see
36:07
what's coming and usually they'll follow
36:08
me or come because i'm there
36:10
but i got the best picture ever of this
36:13
one aragon and you would call him a
36:15
dragon uh and dragons thing about
36:17
dragons that i do know is there is one
36:21
who's one of the gods in like these um
36:24
asian countries
36:26
and they have five toes i'm getting real
36:29
specific okay
36:30
uh none of heaven's aragon's and for
36:33
whatever reason they have four toes not
36:36
five
36:38
it is very interesting it was something
36:40
the holy spirit showed me and i went and
36:41
looked and i checked out and it's
36:43
absolutely true
36:44
some of these dragons that they show and
36:46
you know i do also want to go back to
36:48
the word that that god called satan the
36:51
old dragon
36:53
and there's a reason why he called him
36:55
an old dragon an old dragon would be
36:57
toothless they'd have no fire left in
37:00
them they'd have no power left in them
37:02
at all if you think about why he called
37:04
him that
37:05
god has a behemoth which is an aragon he
37:08
has one himself
37:09
and uh but they're not bad in any way
37:12
are they bad uh so that's just uh not
37:15
that you should bring well i will go
37:17
into another time but you shouldn't
37:18
bring certain things in and just hang
37:20
pictures of stuff on your walls i
37:22
definitely wouldn't hang anything that
37:23
was a
37:24
attached to witchcraft in any way you
37:27
don't want to bring that into your home
37:29
just don't do it
37:31
derek prince found that out himself and
37:33
one of his stories he told but but the
37:36
five-toed dragon is worshiped in other
37:38
asian countries as a god uh but all of
37:42
the aragons that fight in heaven or come
37:44
from heaven have four toads and their
37:48
whole purpose is to work with the army
37:50
of heaven so yes there are some you
37:52
actually can write on them in heaven
37:54
when you when you go there but they're
37:56
called eragons that's true wow that's
37:58
good and someone else i don't remember
38:00
if i ask you this but a different
38:02
question at a different time wanted to
38:04
know if satan or if the enemies of our
38:07
soul
38:08
can he press things into the cloud too
38:10
would someone look at that and say well
38:11
that looks like demonic
38:13
or or does he have not not the power to
38:15
do anything with that what would you say
38:17
oh no they you know i i would just tell
38:20
people the spirit realm all around us
38:23
is unseen there's more of the spirit
38:25
round than the physical realm you need
38:26
to understand that the physical realm
38:29
was stretched out like a curtain before
38:32
god even put these physical uh planets
38:34
and stars before he put them there he
38:36
actually had to make a physical realm
38:39
it talks about in the bible where he
38:41
says uh you know he stretched it out
38:43
like a curtain that's actually what he
38:45
did before he made the earth and
38:47
everything uh he spoke the word and the
38:50
word actually stretched the curtain out
38:53
and that's why it says at the very end
38:56
of the bible he will fold this all up
38:58
like an old garment which i think is
39:00
pretty cool yeah so further on in the
39:03
early in the bible it says you stretch
39:04
the stars and plants out like a curtain
39:06
and but at the very end it says he will
39:08
fold it all away like a garment hey
39:10
there's that curtain he's folding it
39:11
away and going to make all things new so
39:14
that's just to let you understand in
39:16
order to have this physical plan and you
39:18
live here in the physical body you had
39:20
to make a physical realm the spirit
39:22
realm always existed it's a real realm
39:25
everything in it has substance it's all
39:27
spiritual it's all spiritually
39:29
um
39:31
living but that's why in your spiritual
39:34
body you literally live a real life in
39:36
heaven if you base down here you have
39:38
the best bakery in heaven uh if you run
39:41
rodeos you have rodeos in heaven but the
39:43
the bulls and the horses are talking to
39:44
you the whole time you're trying to ride
39:45
them and you're not ever going to win
39:47
probably up there
39:49
but but there's a difference your spirit
39:51
is unseen right now but in heaven is
39:53
seen everywhere this what you've
39:56
to clarify that can a spirit can an evil
39:58
spirit do something with the clouds that
40:00
someone would identify yes okay and i do
40:03
have i this is kind of tight
40:06
i do have some pictures of them in the
40:08
clouds i'm not showing this yet because
40:10
yeah but they are and sometimes like
40:13
like in you might think if they haven't
40:15
been photoshopped in some severe weather
40:18
you might actually see some faces off
40:21
the darkness okay and some of those in
40:23
those situations
40:25
but there are more of the hosts on the
40:28
earth than there are the demonic but yes
40:30
they can also but they don't do a good
40:32
job of it i'm just going to say there's
40:34
a big difference in how they try to make
40:36
a shape because some of the hosts can
40:38
get together and make some kind of
40:39
really fantastic shape in the clouds
40:42
um but the demonic when they try to do
40:44
it they don't want to they don't work
40:46
together they just don't work together
40:48
they don't like each other they don't
40:50
i'm talking about the dark army the
40:51
eamon the demons
40:53
they don't like each other they don't
40:54
care about each other they don't want to
40:56
work together at all and so what they
40:58
try to do together usually doesn't turn
41:01
out really good
41:03
and i want to clarify that one thing
41:05
that you said because i'll make sure
41:06
people know what you're referring to
41:08
maybe you need to give an example but
41:10
you said derek prince learned the hard
41:11
way put something on his wall what are
41:13
you referring to that someone put on a
41:14
wall that someone should be because we
41:16
were talking about clouds and all of a
41:18
sudden you were saying this i want to be
41:19
sure people know what you're referring
41:21
to about don't put them yeah back when
41:22
we were talking about the dragon thing
41:24
okay
41:25
yeah he and this is a story he told
41:28
himself of course we all know he's in
41:29
heaven right now uh he did get them i
41:31
think he inherited them from his
41:33
grandfather or something when he he
41:36
served i think in one of the wars in an
41:38
asian country and brought back pictures
41:40
of these um
41:41
i think they were the five-toed dragons
41:43
okay okay that's what he put on the wall
41:46
yeah and he didn't he was clueless and
41:48
you know derek prince was one of the
41:49
first ones to talk about piercing the
41:51
darkness he actually he began to uh to
41:53
look at that listen to god and god
41:55
taught him a lot about the darkness and
41:57
the spirit realm and the darkness and
41:59
yet it changed everything when he put
42:00
him on his walls he didn't say to god
42:03
are these are these acceptable he just
42:05
put him on his walls even
42:08
i think his wife got real sick his
42:09
friends began to hate him his business
42:11
was falling apart and finally and every
42:14
time he walked by him he would admire
42:16
them i just tell you what he said
42:17
himself he would admire them aren't they
42:19
beautiful oh i love them you know i mean
42:21
he was actually
42:23
and finally he went to god and said why
42:25
is my wife so sick why have my friends
42:28
all left me and god said you have a
42:30
defilement and you've put on your walls
42:31
you need to take them off
42:35
he said what he said the dragons
42:39
you know mine
42:40
walked he cleansed his house he cleansed
42:42
it and immediately listen his wife was
42:46
healed
42:48
back his his business and his money
42:50
exploded
42:52
because he had obeyed god and after that
42:54
he that's when he began to teach people
42:57
be careful what you bring into your home
42:59
if it's statues of other gods they
43:01
wouldn't bring it you know what god said
43:03
about that himself you know he said to
43:05
break them up and not even have nothing
43:06
to do with them it isn't this is a thing
43:08
it isn't like
43:10
a statue of so-and-so
43:12
you know not real god
43:14
that thing itself wouldn't hurt you but
43:16
the spirit attached to it
43:19
and all these um
43:20
things that are going on out there no
43:22
matter what demonic
43:24
influence it is it's not i'm not going
43:26
to name certain religions right now
43:28
because people will be focusing on them
43:30
and some people are very nice and some
43:32
of them not everybody is against people
43:34
a lot of these people in false religions
43:37
are actually kind they don't understand
43:38
why people hate each other but the point
43:40
is this your life is run by the devil
43:42
the devil is over every antichrist
43:45
spirit and the antichrist spirit means
43:47
they're against jesus
43:49
as god and so he introduces all these
43:52
false gods some countries have hundreds
43:54
of them and they they worship them they
43:56
bring food to them they make temples for
43:58
them and that is not helping their life
44:01
in any way whatsoever because they have
44:03
no power to save no power to heal
44:06
and that's god's point you want to bring
44:08
something in and here you are honoring
44:10
something that is an image that is
44:13
worshipped as a false god you know
44:16
not to keep them in your house my
44:18
grandparents were missionaries in china
44:20
my father was born in china i remember
44:23
used to see this massive ornate wooden
44:26
carved hand-carved chest and it was out
44:29
in the living room when we go to our
44:30
grandparents now they were devout
44:31
christian people
44:33
but a whole lot of evil got into my
44:35
family and now
44:36
years later i'm kind of they're all
44:38
going to be with the lord but
44:39
there was a lot of evil stuff that
44:41
entered in as you know i've adjusted to
44:43
with my about my father it makes me
44:45
wonder did them sitting here displaying
44:47
these ornate things with these
44:49
tibetan
44:51
gods or these idols and these things and
44:54
i would go to their house and they're
44:55
all these chinese
44:58
things hanging on the wall some of them
45:00
were probably
45:01
fine but others were these little ornate
45:03
gods and then one of and my
45:05
grandfather's brother gave us that gift
45:07
and i mentioned it before these ivory
45:08
little gods
45:10
from india because they're all the
45:11
missionaries went over there and got all
45:12
these goods so they could show people
45:14
isn't this beautiful it's crazy well we
45:17
could could talk ourselves into thinking
45:19
that's just pretty and that's nice
45:22
some of them you're right some of them
45:23
are harmless some of them are beautiful
45:26
uh people and some of these foreign
45:28
countries have such amazing gifts to
45:30
create
45:32
they don't know god for who he is
45:34
i'm sure if they did they would be
45:36
putting images and some who got born
45:38
again i do know have have done the same
45:41
type of thing but they put the image of
45:43
christ they put the angelic or whatever
45:45
of that on there but the thing is if you
45:47
don't have discernment if you're not a
45:50
seer and you can't see what's around it
45:52
i'd be very careful
45:54
about what you pick up i'm not saying i
45:56
don't like people thinking you have to
45:58
look at every single inch in your place
46:00
or every single thing you have but i
46:02
would say if you know it to be something
46:04
that you know is not a true god
46:07
why have that there instead of something
46:09
that represents heaven or god which is
46:10
one of the reasons by the way by god is
46:13
about to flood the marketplace with all
46:15
kinds of things that represent heaven
46:17
that represent them so people have a
46:19
choice because i understand right now in
46:21
our marketplace especially the one right
46:22
now there's not a whole lot of choice to
46:24
bring light or life or hope even hope
46:27
into people's lives but it does matter
46:30
what what you do portray it matters the
46:33
images you wear it matters the images
46:35
you have put on your skin
46:37
uh i'm just saying god marks people
46:40
himself sometimes but what image are you
46:42
betraying is it's for the kingdom of
46:44
darkness or not sometimes people need to
46:46
break off any connection with what
46:49
they've had put tattooed on them and say
46:51
i break any sever any connection with
46:52
that i know people who were affected by
46:55
that so
46:57
image people used to say image is
46:59
nothing but actually according to god
47:00
image is everything
47:01
it is everything okay well what you
47:03
represent or what you believe sometimes
47:05
or people will think that so we went a
47:08
long way on that whole thing yeah that
47:09
was good that'll give people some tools
47:11
to deal with now this is a i was talking
47:13
to my staff
47:14
beforehand this is a fascinating
47:16
question i would have not thought this
47:18
question would ever be asked but listen
47:21
i think it's really interesting she goes
47:22
i love to knit and crochet she was
47:25
excuse what is it going to be like in
47:27
heaven for a knitter or a crocheter i
47:30
believe that i will have a mansion for
47:32
my knitting
47:34
interesting what are your thoughts i
47:36
agree if that is a gift that she has and
47:38
she loves it and she's really excellent
47:40
at it i think she probably will have a
47:42
studio what what he does he gives
47:44
everybody gets a mansion but part of
47:46
that property or even part of that
47:49
mansion definitely would be you know i
47:52
know you've heard me say people have
47:53
restaurants in heaven they have studios
47:56
they have galleries
47:58
a lot probably number one what she would
48:00
be knitting would be alive the threads
48:02
she would knit together could make
48:04
different tunes and become a symphony
48:06
when she's done with what she makes
48:08
it could also portray something that
48:09
would represent images of things that
48:12
are already in heaven but i do know
48:14
paintings when you paint in heaven they
48:16
come alive i mean they're on your wall
48:18
but you can see movement you can see
48:19
life in them i am quite sure that what
48:22
she would make or knit would have a life
48:24
in itself
48:26
wow very very cool
48:28
um okay this is an interesting uh
48:30
question a viewer asked one of the nine
48:32
gifts of the spirit would the seer gift
48:35
fall under
48:39
i don't know if it has to fall under one
48:40
of those yeah i kind of thought you'd
48:43
say that but i didn't
48:44
god gives that gift god and only god and
48:48
people go well you know there's mediums
48:50
out there and other people who can see
48:53
those people were given a gift by god
48:55
but because the other person got
48:56
overtaken or used by
49:00
the darkness then that gift could be
49:02
used for that purpose
49:04
god makes seers and sinceres it's
49:06
important and you can see why all the
49:07
stuff that everyone has benefited from
49:09
that god has shown me or that i see and
49:11
understand it's important to have seers
49:14
but that gift is only given by the
49:17
father and he puts it in you before he
49:19
sends you
49:21
it's in you and there are different
49:23
levels of seeing sometimes you'll see
49:24
something every now and then sometimes
49:26
you'll see parts of things or not
49:28
sometimes you'll see the darkness
49:29
sometimes the
49:30
the uh or heaven stuff i see everything
49:33
all the time like the whole entire uh
49:36
unseen world that's why you're called a
49:38
seer a seer sees the unseen world
49:42
and um you see transportation you see
49:44
beings going back and forth you see how
49:46
they operate
49:47
which has always been powerful for me
49:49
growing up i was powerful
49:52
not powerful like i came against things
49:54
not that kind of power but the powerful
49:56
knowing who i am and i know the truth
49:59
already because i've seen the truth you
50:01
can't hide the truth from a seer
50:04
so being used on the other side in the
50:07
camp of the enemy and people think i'm
50:09
doing this beautiful stuff for him but
50:11
they they connect with spirit guides and
50:14
stuff like that god doesn't have spirit
50:15
guides people
50:17
he has the angelic and mess mattresses
50:19
for him he has holy spirit so even that
50:22
is
50:23
such a small
50:24
area in the life of almost most
50:26
christians don't know
50:28
um they think when you say the word
50:30
spirit you're being filled with the holy
50:31
spirit which are
50:33
very major to be filled with the holy
50:34
spirit or the holy spirit himself i'm
50:36
talking about the unseen realm when i
50:38
say the spirit and the seer sees it
50:42
you see it clearly some see maybe not so
50:46
clearly but someone who's been doing a
50:48
long time and understood that and then
50:49
trained by god
50:51
what to do with that stuff it's very
50:53
powerful
50:54
i don't think a seer has to come under
50:56
those any of those yeah
50:58
yeah there's i think there's a
51:00
fault the false isn't the right word
51:01
there's an incorrect
51:03
understanding that any gift must fall in
51:05
those nine that gives
51:07
thousands of gifts right yeah and things
51:09
that people can do in variations of the
51:11
things so
51:12
yeah because
51:15
people are sent as a gift themself you
51:17
know what they can do what he has given
51:20
them to do or make or
51:23
use for god's purposes
51:25
we are we are sent every good and
51:27
perfect gift comes down from the father
51:30
of lights those lights are you when you
51:32
lived in him and before he sends you to
51:35
this earth he puts a gift in you and
51:37
having you use that gift all over having
51:40
to do things so
51:41
those are uh i think you're talking
51:43
about
51:44
spiritual gifts i think there's nine
51:46
gifts in the spirit spiritual gifts
51:49
but we all in the natural age have a
51:51
gift also but those nine gifts of the
51:54
spirit are different than god making you
51:56
a certain way and this is what he made
51:59
you he made me a seer it's not i saw
52:02
before i mean you know i got saved four
52:05
years old but i still saw in the spirit
52:07
before that i was a seer because he sent
52:10
me that way so i was two and three i'd
52:12
see angels everywhere but at four i gave
52:14
myself to christ i saw him step inside
52:16
of me
52:17
and i knew he was in there and people
52:19
couldn't couldn't get me away from him
52:21
because i saw him step in me so
52:24
well you know the paul talks about
52:26
that's not one of the nine groups of
52:27
spirit that's just something god makes
52:29
you as a senior
52:31
paul talks about uh you know he prays
52:33
that god will give you a spirit of
52:34
wisdom and revelation that you may know
52:35
him better but this
52:37
when whoever gets the spirit of
52:38
revelation
52:39
there's about a zillion ways you can
52:41
revelate or receive you might have a
52:44
vision you might have dreams you might
52:45
suddenly know and you don't know why you
52:47
know right so two ten people with the
52:49
spirit of revelation
52:51
they may not look alike at all as far as
52:53
how they get it
52:54
that's right
52:57
right
52:58
yeah revelation is
53:00
revelation is god speaking all
53:03
revelation comes from the father it does
53:07
uh of course his son was filled with
53:10
revelation but revelation is the mind
53:12
and heart of god himself of the father
53:15
and when he shares it so you openly
53:17
understand the scriptures you understand
53:20
his plans his will his way uh that's
53:23
what revelation is so powerful
53:26
it's not head knowledge it's usually
53:28
something you didn't think of but it's
53:30
so great
53:31
and it's usually simple it it gives you
53:34
something greater um
53:36
to understand the word of god like i
53:38
said but revelation comes from god most
53:41
of the stuff i'm talking about there's
53:42
no way in my mind i could have thought
53:45
about it or even tried to figure it out
53:47
so revelation definitely comes from god
53:50
and there's many people who get
53:51
revelation yeah hey you know that that
53:54
causes a question that wasn't on my list
53:56
because it happened to me this morning i
53:57
woke up in the middle of the night in
53:59
the middle of the night there's a praise
54:01
song it's like i'm praising but it's an
54:03
old
54:04
old praise song i wouldn't have thought
54:06
about i wouldn't have known and all of a
54:09
sudden the words the music i'm hearing
54:10
it in my mind
54:12
and then this then i went back to sleep
54:14
because i started to praise him and i
54:15
fell back to sleep i wake up a totally
54:17
different praise song is going through
54:19
my mind also when i hadn't thought of
54:21
for months and months so what is that is
54:24
that god asking telling my
54:26
is that god causing praise to rise
54:28
through my spirit while i'm asleep or is
54:31
that god telling me i need to be
54:32
praising how would you discern that i
54:35
think that's
54:36
him filling your spirit with it while
54:38
you're sleeping
54:40
uh people who really seek god even while
54:42
you're sleeping he can impart things
54:44
into you
54:45
and if you happen to wake up in the
54:47
middle of some of that something like
54:49
what you just explained
54:51
some people would get up and just start
54:53
worshiping it's always it's always
54:55
important to worship you know i
54:58
i worship in many different ways with
55:00
god i don't have a voice that i could go
55:02
sing on a platform people would probably
55:03
laugh at me and i wouldn't do that to
55:05
you anyway but on my own of course i do
55:08
jen's laughing behind them
55:11
right now
55:14
just as a funny note just to be funny
55:16
when i was first speaking and i didn't
55:18
really have a clue you know how to do it
55:20
and do any of that the revelation was in
55:23
me but i didn't really know so we went
55:24
to somebody's we used to do a lot of
55:26
home meetings don't ask me to do
55:30
you couldn't get the people in your home
55:31
they'd be all over your yard but they
55:33
were hooking me up for a mic and it was
55:35
right before worship was supposed to
55:36
start
55:37
and jen looks at them and she goes she's
55:39
not leading worship right
55:42
now
55:43
yeah i'm not leading worship right now
55:45
no no no we wouldn't do that
55:53
so we're both like warning them no we
55:55
don't know no she doesn't do that you
55:57
couldn't you could have just made a
55:58
joyful sound you know but some people's
56:00
joyful sound is better than other
56:02
people's joyful sounds but sometimes
56:04
sometimes steve when you wake up first
56:06
thing i will just say this and this is
56:08
truth when you first wake up those first
56:11
few minutes are so key to you probably
56:13
hearing god very clearly i would wake up
56:16
and say do you have something to say to
56:18
me and i'd be talking to god this is
56:20
something you want to say to me
56:22
many times i wake up and the minute my
56:23
eyes open he starts speaking to me and i
56:26
have found it's true when you're between
56:28
that window of the natural
56:31
realm and the spiritual realm
56:34
sometimes he can actually show and tell
56:36
you things if you would wait a few
56:38
minutes and ask him he probably wouldn't
56:41
start to get
56:43
have like visions or have encounters so
56:46
i've never really told people that but
56:48
when i first wake up which is my few
56:51
hours
56:52
he's already even starting to speak to
56:54
me that's when he walks through the wall
56:56
of my home sometimes he'll just start
56:58
sharing things with me i haven't
57:00
connected fully with this natural in
57:03
other words i haven't left my room i
57:04
haven't gone out into civilization yet
57:07
it's really one of the best times to
57:10
begin to listen and see if he's saying
57:12
something and you're so open already
57:14
that when you when you wake steve you're
57:16
already hearing what's going on around
57:18
you that could even be some activity of
57:21
heaven around you happening and that's
57:23
why you're hearing
57:24
some of that music so it could also mean
57:26
that that's really good good good
57:28
teaching good to know because you know
57:30
all i could think of is god must want me
57:32
to worship and so i began but next thing
57:35
i know i'm about i'm asleep again but if
57:37
if i were more intentional and say don't
57:40
let yourself go to sleep
57:42
praise him on purpose and don't go to
57:43
sleep that probably would have been a
57:45
good deal or you could just say steve
57:48
do you want to share something with me
57:50
right in the middle of it say father is
57:52
that you wanting to share something with
57:54
me you might be surprised
57:56
that's good okay that's good good i'll
57:59
do that so
58:00
let me just see i'm cutting notes here
58:02
make sure all right
58:03
let's see
58:05
here's the interesting almost funny
58:06
question is there gravity in heaven
58:11
oh well um there is a form of type of
58:14
gravity i don't think they don't call it
58:15
gravity if you if you jump and you want
58:18
to go down your purposes go down you're
58:19
going to go down okay
58:21
uh you in people i have learned by this
58:24
time that a lot of people do fly all
58:25
over heaven you just can you know when i
58:27
first started going in the beginning
58:29
there's been so much more he's shown me
58:31
i'm so busy sharing what he showed me in
58:33
the beginning and things that people
58:35
really should know about i don't always
58:37
get to add stuff but many people most
58:40
people whenever they when they've been
58:42
there for a while they realize they can
58:44
just like fly around heaven and stuff
58:46
like that if you want to leap on high
58:48
things you also can do that there's
58:50
buildings floating in the air i know
58:51
i've said that you just leap from where
58:53
you're at and you leap maybe 20 30 feet
58:55
above the
58:58
streets or wherever and you can actually
58:59
go into the building that way and when
59:01
you come out you just jump it's not like
59:03
you're going to fault the speed of light
59:04
and smash yourself
59:06
but you will go down that's your purpose
59:08
to go down and you'll go down so it it's
59:10
it's a different life completely well
59:12
yeah you know when i picture heaven i'm
59:15
thinking this beautiful scene this
59:16
building this something but
59:20
in when you're in heaven are you seeing
59:21
activity in the air all the time are you
59:24
seeing it all the time
59:27
oh yeah you're seeing stuff going on all
59:29
the time in the in the i call it the um
59:33
i call it the celestial round would be
59:35
all the sky of heaven the celestial
59:36
realm wrapped around the world god
59:38
heaven
59:39
there's almost as much activity up there
59:41
there's buildings there's streets to go
59:43
on in in the sky there's shops to go
59:46
into oh there's all kinds of things to
59:48
do you can imagine you're not bound just
59:50
to be walking on the ground
59:53
uh you travel on light you travel on
59:55
sound you travel on music it's just
59:57
almost inconceivable try to take i can't
60:00
wait till we start making movies we are
60:02
going to make movies god's already
60:03
informed me of that and you will
60:05
actually see life in heaven lived in in
60:08
movies but they haven't liked this one
60:11
he said they exist to live they didn't
60:13
live until they got that
60:15
yeah
60:16
anything i'm not going to argue with
60:18
people i have to always say that you'll
60:20
know your body sleeps in the ground your
60:21
body does but you aren't your body your
60:24
body's wrapped around your spirit man
60:27
you were always a spiritual little being
60:29
a little one and then when you came to
60:31
earth and he gave you this body this
60:33
body adapted to the appearance kind of
60:35
of your spirit man you become like one
60:38
then of course when you die your spirit
60:40
goes to heaven your soul is in your
60:42
spirit your soul is not sleeping okay
60:46
that's not right your soul is never
60:47
going to sleep it never sleeps your
60:48
soul's awake even while you're sleeping
60:50
now that's why you should play awesome
60:52
music and feed your spirit or somebody
60:55
words of god speaking or something
60:57
or i'm just tell people feed your spirit
60:59
at night by listening to something
61:00
that's powerful or beautiful that would
61:03
that would um
61:04
open up you know more of your spirit to
61:07
hear but but no there's so much activity
61:10
in the sky of heaven i think half of
61:12
half of heaven is in the sky the other
61:14
half the beautiful ground of heaven so
61:18
yeah well yeah the stuff in the sky like
61:20
that it makes me think of movies where
61:22
they make
61:23
everything in the air but i know i don't
61:24
normally think of it that way but okay
61:26
this one caleb wants to know has cat
61:29
ever seen michelangelo
61:31
or any other famous painters and artists
61:34
like van gogh and chris you've seen a
61:36
lot of people but there's thousands you
61:38
haven't seen it's not like you've seen
61:39
them all
61:40
have you seen any famous artists like
61:42
that or old time
61:44
they there are there are of course
61:46
there's famous artists who went there
61:48
many of them knew god and were close to
61:50
god themselves
61:51
i can't at this moment i've seen work
61:54
done by some of them but but i can't say
61:56
i literally saw that person and you're
61:58
right there's actually millions of
62:00
people in heaven right now people
62:03
picture heaven with a handful of people
62:05
in health full of the masses but there's
62:07
there's a lot of people that live in
62:09
heaven and heaven is so huge it's bigger
62:12
than our own galaxy the world called
62:14
heaven is bigger than a galaxy
62:16
there's no way okay you've been bent but
62:18
the few places but significant places
62:21
like the throne room and other places
62:23
that are in heaven god wants people to
62:25
know
62:26
uh it's this earth is a shadow it's just
62:29
a shadow of what's there the beauty
62:31
splendor wonder the activity that your
62:33
loved ones are getting to do some of
62:35
them actually ask things to be prepared
62:37
to bless you when you get there there
62:39
are places you know he says i might we
62:42
go to prepare i go to prepare a place
62:44
for you
62:45
that place is not just one mansion i
62:49
will tell you that again on the ground
62:51
or property which could be miles if you
62:54
want miles around your property
62:57
and have beautiful things on that
62:58
property that you love to do or enjoy
63:00
doing there's doors all over the
63:03
property just floating about a foot
63:04
above the ground when you walk in that
63:07
door on your property it takes you to
63:09
another part of your place it could be
63:10
somewhere else in heaven wow wow so your
63:13
place can be
63:15
okay so i've always
63:17
thought well i'd like to have a place in
63:18
the mountain
63:19
in heaven a place on the valley and a
63:22
place
63:23
by the sea whatever because that's what
63:25
i would like here
63:26
but you're saying you don't go out
63:29
through that doorway that portal to go
63:31
to another place
63:33
it's all your place is that what you're
63:35
saying yes you're right it's all in your
63:37
place
63:38
it's in another part of heaven it would
63:40
be in another area of heaven but when
63:42
you go through that door what you're
63:44
seeing is yours
63:46
that's good yeah yeah
63:50
okay uh here's a woman joanie who says
63:53
cat i've been praying for the gift of
63:55
tongues and it hasn't happened yet what
63:57
can i do
63:59
what can you tell her
64:00
i would say you know of course when
64:04
when i was 18 um when i got filled with
64:06
the holy spirit of course by that time i
64:09
had seen i was raised up in um
64:13
a godly home not perfect home been in a
64:15
godly home where god was so real to me i
64:19
mean he was very real
64:21
activity activities of heaven they were
64:23
real
64:24
i knew about hell i mean my dad
64:26
explained all the stuff says he was very
64:28
very close to the father to jesus
64:31
and so it's his mother so we have
64:33
generations of
64:35
being connected to heaven even while
64:37
living on the urn
64:39
and so i i can just to tell people that
64:42
um i already forgot the question
64:45
about about how to get how to speak in
64:47
tongues she hasn't been able to speak in
64:49
tongues
64:50
yeah the holy spirit's greatest delight
64:53
is to indwell you
64:54
i can tell you that he waits with
64:56
anticipation once you're born again to
64:59
invite him i i would just say i actually
65:02
just invited him to indwell me and said
65:04
i invite you to indwell me holy spirit i
65:06
want to know you uh i want to i want to
65:09
feel your presence around me and and to
65:13
you know i don't think i spoke in
65:14
tongues at that very moment i think it
65:16
was probably later on in the day i was
65:18
just thinking about god thinking about
65:20
that i invited the holy spirit
65:22
and opened my mouth and out came just
65:24
two syllables
65:25
and and that was beside myself excited i
65:28
just kept saying those two syllables and
65:30
pretty soon more read and more were
65:31
added sometimes it happens different
65:34
ways some people are instantly filled
65:36
with the holy spirit and your that's
65:38
they call that also your they can call
65:40
that your prayer language it's another
65:42
word for speaking in tongues that the
65:44
devil is terrified of he doesn't want
65:46
anyone to have that power it's power it
65:49
gives you power
65:50
it gives you confidence in who you are
65:53
the holy spirit will help lead you guide
65:55
you he'll never leave you but there's a
65:57
difference and when you're born again he
65:59
comes alongside and it says that in the
66:01
bible when you're born again the holy
66:02
spirit is alongside you and he will help
66:05
you but when you invite him in when you
66:07
invited him to come in he came in
66:10
for whatever reason you didn't speak at
66:13
that time i would encourage you to keep
66:15
pressing in i wouldn't keep asking i
66:18
know back in the day i was taught you
66:20
ask until you get you ask for hours if
66:22
you have to i think it was the holy
66:24
spirit i don't know what i think about
66:25
that if you sincerely invited him to
66:28
come and indwell you uh it empowers you
66:31
uh you you feel different number one you
66:34
feel like the power of god in you life
66:36
god in you you feel increasing in
66:38
presence of him i have no one of my own
66:41
sisters had that experience and i think
66:43
it was
66:44
some sometime
66:46
i think she's had a few syllables here
66:47
and there in tongues but let me tell you
66:49
the power of god and the prophetic began
66:51
to operate in her after she invited him
66:53
to indwell her this this is the truth
66:56
and i know that we we it says the
66:58
evidence of speaking in tongues the
67:00
evidence that's that's the outward
67:02
evidence and sign to people around you
67:04
knowing that you received him
67:06
i don't think that stops you from having
67:08
him inside of you and you may not have
67:10
ever heard any pastor or preacher ever
67:12
say that before but you invite him to
67:15
indwell you he's going to come in if
67:18
you've got christ in your heart he's
67:19
going to come in
67:20
and then i would just say holy spirit
67:22
show yourself to me
67:24
demonstrate yourself to me open up my
67:27
mouth that i can speak you know speak in
67:30
tongues
67:31
and then i would just say just start
67:33
praising him i would just start telling
67:34
people say when i would help people get
67:36
tongues sometimes you lay your hand on
67:38
sometimes if people already have a lot
67:40
of that they can lay hands on you and
67:41
then then you just start speaking in
67:43
tongues so you can't say
67:46
don't say there's only one way to get it
67:48
the one way you have to get it is you
67:50
are born again you've repented of your
67:52
sins jesus christ is in you he's your
67:54
savior and from the moment you decide to
67:57
pursue i want to speak in tongues i want
67:59
that holy language
68:01
and i will say this also when you pray
68:03
in tongues the devil doesn't know what
68:04
you're saying the devil cannot
68:06
understand
68:08
tongues which is why he doesn't want
68:10
anyone to be filled with it it's like
68:12
the perfect prayer language that you
68:14
know when you're praying what god is and
68:16
putting in you to pray it's very
68:18
powerful but i would say if you've
68:21
already asked to start thanking him is a
68:23
better term to say thank you for the
68:25
evidence of speaking in tongues i've
68:27
already received you and you need to say
68:29
that the holy spirit if you've invited
68:31
holy spirit i choose my will to invite
68:33
you to indwell my person
68:35
to to come on the inside of myself that
68:38
i might understand clearly and and have
68:41
more understanding in the presence of
68:42
god and then you start saying to him
68:44
thank you for indwelling me and thank
68:47
you for giving me open and loosen my
68:49
tongue that i can speak in the heavenly
68:51
language i would really encourage you to
68:53
do that that's that's really really good
68:55
all right this is maybe this is the last
68:57
one um we get a number of questions that
69:00
relate to
69:01
night
69:02
or things so it says i know there's no
69:04
nighttime in heaven but is there a place
69:06
where it is dark where you can see neon
69:08
lights or city lights like it is not
69:11
like it is dark sorry like it is night
69:14
because sometimes it looks beautiful
69:15
looking at night lights
69:19
there's not darkness like we have the
69:20
dark of night here it's never that dark
69:24
there are times where i would have to
69:26
say
69:27
uh the light isn't probably as
69:29
terrifically bright but i will also say
69:31
this
69:32
the first time i was taking this
69:33
somewhere in heaven where i saw those
69:35
lights you wished you could see you saw
69:38
them in in daylight what you would call
69:40
a daylight they were so bright wow it
69:43
streamed out of this whole place you saw
69:45
these brilliant lights everywhere coming
69:48
out of this one place whoops where
69:50
people would go i'm always putting my
69:51
stuff back together
69:53
one day i will have an actual studio
69:56
people there you go uh but i saw these
69:58
brilliant lines i went what is that
70:01
place i mean i was i was unknown it was
70:03
so beautiful you saw beautiful images
70:06
coming through it but these rays of
70:07
light it wasn't just oh that's a pretty
70:09
light it was moving in and out of this
70:11
place
70:13
and uh so trust me even in light the
70:16
light around you
70:18
their lights if they're going to put a
70:19
light show on they can totally they do
70:21
fireworks in heaven not the way we do
70:23
but they have fireworks in heaven and
70:25
they see them clearly but there's like
70:26
paler colors that come through the
70:28
different parts of the sky and different
70:30
parts of heaven
70:31
so i'm sure and and if you want to see
70:33
outer space from heaven you have to step
70:35
through this big doorway that's called
70:37
the observatory you're out in space
70:40
you're not just looking at it
70:42
well and that didn't you say out in
70:44
space it's not dark like we see space
70:47
now but it's isn't a color to it
70:50
oh if you're if you're out in space
70:52
around heaven you see the light of every
70:54
star no matter how far away it is the
70:57
lights of the stars the nebulas the the
71:00
all the beauty of the art i call it a
71:02
space art that god made up there you're
71:04
so far uh right now they call it deep
71:06
space or when they they go up in the
71:08
spaceships uh if they're bi planets that
71:11
make light or if they're by moons like
71:13
circling them or something they have
71:15
more light it's different in in the
71:17
celestial realm around heaven you
71:19
literally are stepping out into part of
71:22
space and seeing it for yourself so you
71:25
can do that you don't have to have a
71:27
telescope to see
71:28
but you do step through this doorway
71:30
that's another whole part that you can
71:32
see beautiful stars and nebulas and
71:34
stuff like that is there a color is
71:36
there a color
71:38
there's color there's color everywhere
71:40
out in space really and they even sell
71:42
calendars you might want to go get some
71:44
that show that they have some out right
71:46
now uh in the stores for the 2022 now
71:49
i'm pushing someone else's product you
71:51
can actually probably order just called
71:53
the galaxies it could be called the
71:55
galaxies or something like that
71:56
and it's when the um when they said some
71:59
of the
72:01
sometimes i'm not good on head knowledge
72:02
when i'm talking about revolution
72:05
they send the ships out to seek out
72:07
places and get pictures of them without
72:09
light
72:10
things like that and they've got
72:12
beautiful uh beautiful close-up pictures
72:15
of a lot of they're called nebulas they
72:17
say they're made out of gas but i know
72:19
that you know particles of gas coming
72:21
together and make a perfect eye out in
72:23
space i'm sorry people that just doesn't
72:25
come on its own yeah
72:27
things like you would look in those
72:28
calendars you would see stuff like that
72:31
stepping through the observatory
72:33
it's called the observatory there's no
72:34
telescope you just walk through this
72:36
ancient looking amazing doorway and
72:39
you're out there in in space seeing all
72:41

74:28
teaching spirit force
74:30
is the number one revelation god has
74:32
given me to train the body of christ how
74:35
to be a member of the army of god that
74:38
it talks about in the bible i'm not
74:39
talking about heaven's army you as a
74:41
member of the army of god on the earth
74:44
will learn how to use all of the weapons
74:46
he gave you spiritual weapons
74:48
and our his plan is for us to crush
74:51
darkness that's the enemy the spiritual
74:53
darkness and push it back
74:55
and you have the right to do that as a
74:57
member of the body there's a lot of
74:58
scripture in all this but the training
75:00
is the most important part and you will
75:03
everybody know we've been getting phone
75:05
calls from everywhere people want to
75:06
sign up for it and we'll have more
75:08
information on spirit force but it'll be
75:10
the number one thing i do next year all

01:34
hey welcome to the broadcast and happy
01:37
wednesday
01:38
january 19 2022
01:42
it's nice to be back sorry i've been
01:44
gone since i think the last time you saw
01:46
me was a week ago today when i did
01:50
the broadcast with kat i we had quite a
01:53
lot of stuff happening i was i was
01:55
supposed to be heading out to the clay
01:57
clark event and uh
02:00
i got taken out by one mega back injury
02:04
and so i didn't wasn't able to go and
02:06
then no sooner did we return home
02:08
from the airport with you know we were
02:11
headed toward the airport we had to turn
02:13
around and come back then drain got sick
02:15
with what we think is probably the
02:17
latest variant
02:19
uh that's going around in about two days
02:22
after that i got it so right now even as
02:24
we speak both three and i got up this
02:27
morning and even though we're doing a
02:28
lot better
02:30
we're still feeling that nausea that in
02:32
fact for me it's the first time it just
02:33
showed up same thing that happened to
02:35
her so
02:36
ah this thing holds on but anyways uh
02:39
thank you all for
02:40
honoring kelsey o'malley
02:44
she did a great great job and i'm very
02:46
much appreciated appreciative of her for
02:49
to stepping in for me but
02:51
it's nice to be back it's nice totally
02:54
nice to be back because you know i like
02:56
to be involved and i don't like to just
02:58
sit around but man
03:00
you want to sleep you want to just ah
03:02
anyway appreciate the prayers thank you
03:05
so much um
03:06
for all of you who did pray for me you
03:08
know even on the back injury that i had
03:11
i don't think we publicized this because
03:14
sometimes it's better not to you know i
03:16
had a mentor you all know who bobby
03:19
connor is and he used to teach never let
03:21
the enemies see you sweat
03:23
um and basically
03:26
the whole thing was don't make a big
03:28
deal to the enemy
03:29
how injured you are because then he
03:31
knows he's one so
03:33
so you try not to complain and you don't
03:36
say oh poor me you know
03:38
and uh so
03:40
that kind of translates well this way
03:42
too because if he told if we told
03:43
everybody oh i'm i'm laying flat on my
03:46
back with this big old injury then
03:48
everyone's worried about you so it's
03:50
almost better to just find out we have a
03:52
prayer team that are always keeping us
03:54
covered so we do cover those things in
03:56
prayer very very seriously when they
03:58
happen but we don't always make it a
04:00
general announcement so
04:02
all right well thank you for being
04:06
our loyal viewers and being coming back
04:08
so let's see what do we want to do i
04:10

so
05:05
i think that's about it
05:08
so
05:08
without further ado let's bring cat
05:10
curry here it's about time we got back
05:13
together kat
05:15
yes i i you know what i missed being
05:18
with you miss talking with you but
05:21
your team does a great job just so you
05:23
know that it was really great it was
05:24
really powerful but
05:26
i was praying i didn't know exactly what
05:28
it was but i was definitely declaring
05:30
over you and praying over you which i
05:32
actually do every day you and doreen wow
05:35
thank you something if i feel impressed
05:37
to pray something stronger than i do
05:40
and um
05:41
just because i'd like to take advantage
05:43
of any chance to train people
05:46
when you begin to have any kind of
05:48
strains whether it's your back your leg
05:51
or severe cramps you can you can learn
05:55
or train yourself to release the peace
05:57
of god into that situation and it
05:59
literally will stop that it will stop it
06:03
god told me one time i had actually
06:05
pulled a muscle or something and i kept
06:07
asking him do something he said i'm not
06:08
going to do he said you're going to do
06:10
it and he said you need to learn to
06:12
release what you already carry which is
06:14
the anointing which we all carry
06:15
according to first john 2 27 go look it
06:18
up
06:18
and the anointing brings like a peace
06:21
with it and literally you would lay on
06:23
your hand on yourself like i release i
06:25
impart the peace of god
06:27
and uh and it might work not work the
06:29
first few times but eventually you will
06:31
do that and the cramp or the pain will
06:33
go wow it has to do with muscles and
06:36
tendons or even your bones and i i have
06:39
to do that all the time if i overdo it
06:41
or for whatever reason you know i what
06:44
if for whatever reason if i have any
06:46
pinched anything or strained anything
06:48
that is the number one way i get rid of
06:50
it with the anointing
06:52
wow and you know what kat you told us
06:55
all a couple months ago you talked about
06:57
people that weren't sleeping well which
06:59
has happened to me a lot in my life in
07:01
the last few years
07:02
and you talked about i command the rest
07:04
of god i think is the way i understand
07:06
it and during i've been practicing that
07:09
the first time i thought it didn't
07:10
really get where i wanted it to go but
07:12
when i remember to do it which i usually
07:14
do if i'm having trouble
07:16
yeah and there'll be a little bit of a
07:18
delay the next thing i know i wake up in
07:20
the morning i mean it's like
07:22
it was really really powerful so if you
07:25
have insomnia anyone watching this and
07:28
what you what i would say
07:31
i had to do is i had to engage my faith
07:35
which means i had to believe that what i
07:36
was saying was gonna work or it was just
07:39
words right yeah kind of have to put
07:41
some faith in it
07:42
so it wasn't just words and then i when
07:44
i when i believe that what i say is
07:47
gonna happen i command the rest of god i
07:49
have a great night's sleep cat that was
07:52
that's a phenomenal teaching
07:54
it is and actually
07:56
it's um it's he showed me one time i was
08:00
in the mountains of north carolina he
08:02
showed me one time
08:03
how we create now i'm not talking about
08:05
when i say create people automatically
08:07
think well you know create like people
08:10
and things like that no you know you
08:12
create stuff like you come up with ideas
08:14
to create things whether it's a cake i'm
08:15
always going to say use cake for you
08:17
know don't forget to celebrate and eat
08:18
cake i'm still doing it but smaller
08:20
pieces by the way
08:22
but when you begin to create even in
08:23
heaven you learn to do this so you can
08:26
get a jump start down here on the earth
08:28
and god says the earth and your time on
08:30
earth is actually boot camp for eternity
08:33
and the greater your faith gets the more
08:36
you can get things done but when i said
08:38
your faith and god said you mean your
08:40
soul
08:41
your soul has to be engaged with
08:43
everything you believe or you speak
08:45
about which is why sometimes you don't
08:47
get good things if you're saying nothing
08:49
but negative about yourself guess what
08:50
you're going to think you're going to
08:51
think negative and it will be hard to
08:54
push through that so number one stop
08:56
saying you can't
08:58
or you won't or you don't have you have
09:01
to stop saying those words because of
09:02
course god created with words
09:05
but he taught me he said what you say
09:07
from your mouth has to line up with what
09:10
is in your soul when your soul engages
09:12
with what you're saying and you know
09:14
that is still it is still of course your
09:17
faith your faith comes from there your
09:19
your soul is your mind what you think on
09:21
your will what you decide to do in your
09:23
emotions is what you say or how you say
09:26
it so he said in order to create things
09:29
like
09:30
wholeness in your body still using the
09:32
blood of jesus of course we wouldn't
09:33
have any of this and i want to go back
09:35
to the beginning of him on the cross we
09:38
would have nothing if we didn't have him
09:41
when we create when we command it's
09:43
because of what he did for us because of
09:45
what he gave us the ability and the
09:46
right to do but even in doing this like
09:49
the believing trusting and then you step
09:52
into faith but it's all created in your
09:55
soul which is why it's important god
09:56
said he said to to guard it to guard
09:59
what that is
10:01
don't let the world let man's opinions
10:03
or thoughts of you come in at you
10:06
you say what you say is what you will
10:08
become and we know the word says that so
10:10
when you begin to engage with like i'm
10:12
having creams in my leg and i want this
10:15
to stop and i have the right to tell it
10:17
to stop i do because we were made uh
10:20
perfect in every way we're new creations
10:22
through jesus christ we speak to things
10:25
and they happen that was his whole point
10:27
of doing it when he was on the earth but
10:29
your soul engages in this whole faith
10:31
thing
10:32
if you think on it and you meditate on
10:35
it that's still your mind that's still
10:36
coming from your soul we were always
10:39
taught the soul was not a good thing but
10:40
that was wrong
10:42
a dark soul maybe but not one filled
10:44
with the light of god and the love of
10:45
god
10:46
so when you begin like the rest of the
10:48
lord will use that uh when you begin it
10:50
is still a process like you're being
10:52
trained for anything whether it's to be
10:54
an athletic or trained for business or
10:56
trained even as a baker it's a process
10:59
and the more you do it the better you
11:01
get it the better results you have it is
11:03
the same thing when you're declaring and
11:05
believing for something when you finally
11:07
believe one day and you say i command
11:10
and that's the proper word i command the
11:12
rest of the lord you're not telling god
11:13
what to do you're doing what he said he
11:15
said command you me he was saying you
11:17
say what you want done
11:19
so this all ties back to the word of god
11:21
this is outside the word this is living
11:24
the word of god and you say i command
11:26
the rest of the lord to come upon me and
11:28
you've been believing for sleep praying
11:30
for sleep
11:31
you begin to say i want the rest of the
11:33
lord i need the rest of the lord the
11:34
rest of the lord you come one day you
11:36
say that and you'll be knocked out by
11:38
god
11:40
i mean you will sleep so good all night
11:42
long and every night after that you will
11:46
be able to do that
11:48
you know and then i just said
11:50
son
11:51
i'm just telling you the people that
11:52
that's a real thing and you know it's
11:54
one thing if you hear this teacher or
11:56
that teacher
11:57
say that you know we we have lots and
12:00
lots of teachers and sometimes it's easy
12:02
to you know i don't know if they know
12:04
for sure i don't know if this is just a
12:06
theory of theirs but when kat who's been
12:09
with the father thousands of times yes
12:12
if she says this is what you're supposed
12:14
to do i take it a little more seriously
12:17
maybe i should maybe i should have taken
12:19
well not that i've heard this particular
12:21
teaching before
12:22
but you know cat it works and you know
12:26
i've spent when i i laid bedridden
12:29
people don't know this a lot of people
12:30
don't know this but from about
12:33
oh
12:34
let's see from 12 especially from about
12:37
2010 to 2012 29 i was bedridden and i
12:41
couldn't sleep i laid there night after
12:43
night i was so deprived of sleep if i
12:46
had known this yeah it would have been
12:48
different oh man that would have been so
12:51
great but you know god
12:53
this is why in this time people go well
12:55
why not before this is a special time i
12:58
don't look at the things going on around
13:00
me i don't ignore them i'm innocent of
13:02
evil i'm innocent of darkness you know
13:03
i'm filled with the light of god and
13:05
hope and power i mean hope was wonderful
13:08
but power and operating in is where god
13:10
wants us to be that's we're supposed to
13:12
be dangerous against hell you're
13:14
supposed to be filled with the light and
13:15
love of god always have an answer
13:18
for people
13:19
of truth yes but of the power of god and
13:22
living in the life of god that's what a
13:24
manifested son and daughter is it's not
13:27
some special people who'll send down to
13:29
heaven all of a sudden they'll be here
13:30
on the earth it's us
13:31
it's us it's the body of christ learning
13:33
to operate in the fullness of what he
13:36
always intended and that's why the
13:37
father normally teaches me himself this
13:40
is what you do and say and hello people
13:42
if anybody knows that would be a father
13:45
son or holy spirit and i've been trained
13:47
by all three of them why so you can be
13:50
trained and be empowered
13:52
it's it's excited to be you know you're
13:55
inspired inspiring is nice empowering is
13:58
better okay
14:00
you live above and never beneath
14:03
how can we rule if jesus said you will
14:06
rule with me in this life and in the
14:08
life to come uh your ruling is totally
14:11
different than you know i'm begging and
14:13
it's okay to ask when you don't know but
14:16
but when you begin to declare and decree
14:18
and you begin to say i'm not tolerating
14:21
sickness i'm not having sickness and the
14:23
word actually says when you bless your
14:25
food you mean you must say take sickness
14:28
far from me
14:29
and did you even know that was worse so
14:31
every time you said your blessing thank
14:32
you for the food but then add and take
14:34
sickness far from me wow wow it won't
14:37
have a chance to even come to you but
14:39
again it's a process it's something i
14:42
add all the time in my prayer when i a
14:46
blessing for your food you can add so
14:48
many things in that uh i thank you for
14:50
this food blessed to my body and i ask
14:52
for and receive your wisdom your
14:55
revelation your understanding you keep
14:58
adding because whatsoever you say is
15:00
what you will have
15:02
right whatever within you or you allow
15:04
in you is what you will become that is
15:07
up to you
15:08
okay jesus christ did his part by dying
15:11
but this was a walk in his footsteps he
15:13
was never afraid okay he was never
15:15
afraid of anything he wasn't killed
15:17
honestly he laid down his life he rose
15:20
from the dead he's the king of
15:22
everything everywhere and he wants you
15:24
to be like him so the enemies the world
15:27
the darkness is crushed and pushed back
15:29
that's how things will really begin to
15:32
change
15:33
and that's why he's having me teach
15:35
spirit force which i know that's where
15:36
this button is this is
15:39
and i'll be very soon um next month
15:42
month of march i'll actually start
15:44
teaching that uh in mass to people
15:47
really really good now i want to ask you
15:49
you mentioned something i want to drill
15:50
down on this for a second
15:52
uh when we've been hearing teaching
15:55
through the years and the decades we've
15:57
talked about someday the manifested sons
15:59
of daughters of god
16:01
and and we'd hear this or that statement
16:04
but you said something a minute ago and
16:06
i'm just gonna run this by you
16:08
have you repeat or clarify
16:10
is it possible that
16:12
two believers
16:15
uh
16:16
side by side
16:18
are walking out their life
16:21
and one of them is
16:24
just like a carnal christian and the
16:26
other person's manifested sons and
16:28
daughters of god because they're because
16:31
they're walking it out can can two
16:33
believers
16:35
one being manifested one not
16:39
yes because manifesting well that
16:41
doesn't mean you're not a believer
16:44
right you get born again this is the
16:46
beginning of everything you choose you
16:50
choose how much of god you want your
16:52
life how much time you give him and if
16:55
you are applying
16:56
just the written word of god but it says
16:59
man shall not live by bread alone but by
17:02
every word spoken from the mouth of god
17:05
and of course everything he says is
17:07
based on his word his written word and i
17:11
tell you right now i don't like it when
17:12
people leave parts of the bible out when
17:14
they decide they're going to translate
17:15
it some other way or something you can't
17:17
delete parts of the bible and i don't
17:20
like it when some people decide well i
17:22
don't think i understand that i'm going
17:23
to change this i would be very careful
17:26
if you if you get a bible that leaves
17:27
whole things out that god said would
17:29
happen i don't know that was free free
17:31
commercial from the holy spirit right
17:33
here
17:33
but i can tell you yes uh even in the
17:36
husband and wife or whatever sister
17:38
brother whatever you choose how much of
17:41
god you're gonna run after and let me
17:43
tell you what a manifested son or
17:46
daughter of god this is how the father
17:48
says it
17:49
to manifest
17:51
means to show and prove who and what you
17:55
believe by what you say the choices you
17:57
make and the power of god you operate in
18:00
wow so i
18:03
let me say this even one other way i
18:05
could be having a conversation
18:08
um making this up of course with my
18:10
let's say with my wife and i'm gonna say
18:12
you know i was at the park and i got i
18:14
got into a conversation with this nice
18:16
family member and you know what the wife
18:20
it's like she's one of the manifested
18:22
sons of god
18:24
and i could say that
18:26
and people go what what are you talking
18:28
about and and and the answer would be
18:31
because
18:32
she is manifesting everything that we've
18:35
ever been taught about what a manifested
18:38
sense of the
18:39
god
18:40
sons of god
18:42
yeah using the word sons yeah sons and
18:45
daughters of god
18:46
so that's am i saying that right someone
18:49
can just be
18:50
a manifested and someone next to them
18:52
might not be
18:54
that is true because that person was
18:56
running after god listening to us you're
18:59
applying
19:00
what you're hearing
19:02
when you go to church and sit in a pew
19:04
you know you're not just there to hear
19:06
something you're here to learn something
19:08
you're being trained okay i told you
19:10
this is all boot camp and you become uh
19:14
you the more of god you let in you
19:17
and you hunger after the more like him
19:19
you will begin to operate uh in the word
19:22
of god when god said let us make man in
19:24
our image that's father son and holy
19:26
spirit and after our likeness that's how
19:28
they operate
19:30
so literally he made us not to be him
19:34
he's not saying to him but he wants us
19:36
to operate in authority and dominion
19:38
over the darkness over the evil and if
19:40
you're over here playing around or
19:42
complaining like you know all you have
19:44
is a bad report and i'm not talking
19:46
about what you just said steve but you
19:47
know there are some people that have not
19:49
got one positive thing in their mouth to
19:51
say and if you you're very positive and
19:54
powerful and you help people
19:56
become great in god by believing he
19:58
really is hearing testimonies of
20:01
overcoming in the power of god they
20:03
begin to think differently but if you're
20:05
always only around people who speak doom
20:08
and gloom negative
20:10
you know and they say things like well
20:11
this is never going to change i can't
20:12
stand this there's so much evil
20:14
everywhere well what are you talking
20:16
about are you talking more about the
20:17
evil or more about the power of god to
20:20
demonstrate and manifest is to let
20:22
people know he is alive you walk in that
20:25
authority yourself people know you have
20:27
authority by the way you're talking
20:30
and you demonstrate that by believing it
20:32
and saying it then you even show people
20:35
how to operate like that i would
20:37
definitely say that would be an operated
20:39
son or daughter of god and it says the
20:42
earth is crying out in the word for the
20:45
manifested sons and daughters of god to
20:46
stand up okay the earth itself knows
20:50
that things aren't going right they know
20:51
the evil is trying to invade they want
20:54
us
20:54
we are his sons and daughters that's
20:57
what god calls us right he is our father
20:59
we're sons and daughters but that
21:01
doesn't mean every son or daughter
21:03
manifest and demonstrate who he is by
21:07
the way you live your life it is a
21:09
lifestyle
21:11
what i live is not just something i say
21:13
here it is my life it's how i live and i
21:16
don't change any day and you can tell
21:19
i had someone call last night and say
21:21
you know that their child
21:23
their child was like screaming
21:25
uh that their brain was hurting and to
21:28
pray for them and i know this person
21:30
said he called me that and this is the
21:32
first thing i can tell you this might as
21:33
well teach you right now
21:36
is trying to attack you as a believer
21:38
they have no right but i'm telling you
21:41
if you've learned about the devil he
21:42
does whatever and get away with and i
21:44
was taught this by another prophet um
21:47
uh
21:48
this couple they they did a lot of
21:50
discernment and deliverance and stuff uh
21:53
and they taught me that if you start
21:55
getting sharp pains in your head that is
21:57
a sign that witchcraft is trying to
21:59
affect you
22:01
and i told them after several things i
22:03
went you need to take your hand over
22:05
your child's head and say i sever all
22:08
witchcraft trying to attack my daughter
22:12
and when they did that because they had
22:14
they did have a fever it wasn't ohio and
22:16
instantly
22:17
there was a change
22:19
wow and see they don't think you know
22:22
how to do that this is one of the things
22:23
you're going to learn in um spirit um
22:25
spirit spirit force by the way is the
22:28
way you live and operate that the enemy
22:31
will run from you and actually says
22:33
satan will flee from you if you put
22:34
yourself under the hand of god and
22:36
resist him resist him isn't just saying
22:39
oh don't call me here it's like i'm
22:40
coming after you
22:42
i'm living the way god said i know who i
22:45
am who he is and i'm not tolerating you
22:47
attacking me
22:49
your life will begin to change
22:51
but like witchcraft will try to sneak in
22:53
it tries to control whatever it can get
22:55
away with but i have learned that and
22:58
every now and then i feel like there's a
22:59
spear poking me in my head but i know
23:01
what that is and i'll just say several
23:03
witchcraft right now in jesus name and
23:05
it leaves
23:06
instantly when they did that
23:09
they were shocked
23:11
that instantly there began to be a
23:13
change in their child
23:15
and when they woke up this morning all
23:17
the pain was gone it was all
23:19
that's so good so it's what we know see
23:22
that's why he doesn't want us to be
23:23
clueless
23:25
his word is is a basic foundation for us
23:28
to operate from but when you begin to
23:30
hear directly through holy spirit he
23:32
will train you how to be powerful the
23:34
father it'll never go against what he
23:36
said in his word that you can't live in
23:38
darkness and play in the enemy's camp
23:40
and think you'll have authority
23:42
how can you have authority over somebody
23:44
you're partnering partnering with right
23:46
you can't you can't run out here and
23:47
willingly sin all the time and think you
23:49
can tell them they're not coming near
23:52
you or attacking you it's a lie from
23:54
hell you either live for god
23:57
or you don't live for him and god said
24:00
i'd rather have you hot or cold and if
24:02
you lukewarm i can't do much of anything
24:04
with you that's what that scripture says
24:06
that the scriptures i'll i'll spill you
24:08
out of my mouth that does not mean he
24:10
won't love you you won't get heaven that
24:12
means he can't give you authority to do
24:14
things if you're going to play in the
24:16
middle okay you can't play in the gray
24:17
area you're in the light or the dark and
24:19
i want to add this because i always like
24:21
to give you the more the reason why god
24:23
wants you hot or cold cold you're just
24:26
not doing nothing for living over here
24:27
in the world he said all i have to do is
24:29
get that person saved and they're hot
24:32
they're already actively working in the
24:34
darkness but if you're already on fire
24:36
for god and you're operating powerfully
24:38
you right where he wants you but if
24:40
you're cold you know really still cold
24:42
doing nothing don't even know him he
24:44
said that person who already is doing
24:46
something even though it's not right
24:48
when i get them saved they will be hot
24:51
but the lukewarm they don't want to make
24:53
commitments they don't want to try to
24:55
find out more they're not hungry for him
24:57
they're just hanging on till they die
24:58
and go to heaven one day
25:00
and i i can tell you you will be so
25:02
grateful that you operated and
25:04
manifested the power of the living god
25:07
and what we're about to see in this
25:08
earth will shock people coming from
25:11
believers who run after god not step
25:14
back not jumped off the path especially
25:16
in this time you will be accelerated and
25:19
you will be operating powerfully for him
25:22
with him and because of him
25:24
jesus christ in this world
25:26
that's good well kel we have a lot of
25:28
questions before we get into them
25:30
questions about heaven and related is
25:31
there anything else you want to add are
25:33
you ready for the questions oh i'm ready
25:35
for the question all right so here's the
25:37
first question and i guess i missed this
25:39
a couple times illumination said i
25:41
missed this so here we go
25:43
uh merrill lynn
25:44
interesting spelling
25:47
m-a-r-o-l-y-n-n-e what an what a neat
25:50
way to spell maryland marilyn asked i
25:53
was born with as an idiot
25:56
twin
25:58
uh but yet we look nothing alike as many
26:00
do look like
26:02
god doesn't have even two snowflakes the
26:04
same will twins look alike in heaven
26:06
there's two questions well twins look
26:08
alike in heaven
26:10
and the second question is is there any
26:12
reason why god would give
26:14
uh two births at the same time i guess i
26:16
guess they're asking why are there twins
26:18
why did he do twins okay so first one is
26:22
what is uh will they look alike in
26:24
heaven
26:26
i'm sure it says in the bible we'll go
26:28
back to the bible it says you will be
26:29
known as you were known that means
26:31
people will recognize you like they
26:33
recognize you on the earth you'll look a
26:35
whole lot better i mean the light of
26:36
god's coming out of you you've got joy
26:38
on you you're excited all the time um so
26:41
there could be twins and maybe one was
26:43
happy one wasn't maybe it was gonna be
26:45
maybe it was whatever but he made you
26:47
for a purpose and yes he did make twins
26:50
for a purpose many times twins have a
26:53
very strong connection
26:55
and if you learn how to operate with god
26:57
with that strong connection it's it's
27:00
really it's almost like a two-fold chord
27:03
uh when you when you come together as a
27:05
twin and you have this connection that's
27:08
really different from other siblings
27:10
um it's because god made you that way on
27:13
purpose and yes you will still look like
27:14
you in heaven i see people who look
27:17
alike in heaven that they were twins on
27:19
the earth uh you don't lose that
27:21
and so but you say you have different
27:23
personalities or different likes like i
27:25
like chocolate i like vanilla whatever
27:27
stuff like that or i want to go to the
27:28
valley of the falls and you know i want
27:30
to go to passionate paradise or or i
27:32
want to go to the surf park and
27:34
everybody has their things they like but
27:36
twins and a lot of times do a lot of
27:39
things together and they have especially
27:41
a special bond and god did send people
27:44
as twins on purpose to the earth to have
27:46
that special bonding connection because
27:49
when he gets involved it's very powerful
27:52
well when they pray when they declare uh
27:54
together as twins and lots of times
27:56
they'll know what's going on with the
27:58
other even if they're not together at
27:59
all so
28:00
yeah
28:02
and if they're triplets it's even more
28:04
powerful
28:05
wow yeah wow okay that's interesting all
28:07
right simone asks
28:09
uh when we're singing and worshiping or
28:12
praying do our angels
28:14
do that with us do they or do they
28:16
worship uh with us is the actual
28:19
question do our angels worship with us
28:21
when we're worshiping
28:23
i think most of the time they're
28:25
watching up for your back
28:27
they know you're worshiping and they get
28:28
really excited i can tell you that your
28:30
angels get so excited when you anytime
28:33
you worship god if you're helping
28:35
another person they get really joyous
28:37
they get really joyous when you're
28:39
reading the word of god anytime
28:41
something you're doing that that
28:42
connects you to god but worship is very
28:45
powerful in heaven if you could see
28:47
worship in the spirit realm it's like it
28:49
does many things at one time when you
28:51
worship god from your heart you're so
28:54
dangerous against how missiles like
28:56
missiles come from you and shoot up into
28:58
the second heaven and they bust things
29:00
up in the second heaven because all
29:02
worship goes to god from this earth to
29:04
him that's where it goes actually goes
29:07
to these golden bowls before the altar
29:09
sometimes they come directly into him
29:11
and then he'll take it and he'll himself
29:13
put it in the gold i'm talking about the
29:14
father he'll put your praises like
29:17
incense and they'll put in these golden
29:18
bowls and when they're full he tips them
29:20
and the move of god comes to the earth
29:22
but you're also crushing plans of the
29:25
enemy when you worship
29:27
it is very powerful and it makes jesus
29:31
really really happy because you're
29:33
connecting saying you're hungry for him
29:36
any songs that adore him are the most
29:39
popular ones in heaven if it adores him
29:41
and who christ is and speaks about his
29:44
divinity or or what he has done for us
29:47
here on the earth they love it your
29:49
angels love it when you sing or worship
29:51
him so it's very powerful i see them in
29:54
the meetings worship i'll see them
29:56
worshiping their worship a lot more wild
29:58
than we do though many times they're
30:00
dancing they're spinning
30:02
um they'll walk in and out of you all
30:04
the time that you're worshiping your own
30:06
angels well the whole ceiling fills in
30:09
the sanctuary or wherever you're having
30:12
these meetings if it's outside if you
30:14
could see the seer the whole sky would
30:16
light up with the glory of god from the
30:18
worship coming from you
30:20
sends light into the darkness yeah did
30:22
you just say
30:24
your angels walk in and out of you did
30:26
did i hear you right okay you explained
30:29
that what do you mean because that's and
30:31
and do they they do that now not just in
30:34
heaven but they do that now they walk
30:37
what's what's going on when they do that
30:39
what happened
30:41
they're a spiritual being that's why
30:43
they can walk through the walls this
30:45
physical world is the second realm
30:48
the original realm was a spiritual realm
30:51
where all of things of god that's where
30:53
they live before he made a canvas and
30:55
put all the stars and the planets on it
30:58
it was only a spiritual world but it was
31:00
a literal world well because they're
31:03
protecting and guarding us oh they step
31:05
in and out sometimes i see you sit
31:07
actually
31:08
inside your angels sometimes or you
31:11
stand inside your angels they're always
31:13
right there by you uh uh and around you
31:16
no matter where you go sometimes you
31:18
walk through them and you don't even
31:19
know you're doing that because it's
31:21
they're they're spiritual beings
31:24
is it a protection thing uh because i've
31:27
never really explored this with you when
31:28
they walk in
31:30
you i get that they're spirit beings and
31:33
they can walk through walls and see men
31:35
in anything but when they're walking
31:37
through you what's being is something
31:39
must be being accomplished or they
31:40
wouldn't bother right so
31:43
they're making deposits god will send to
31:45
bother that you know it says your angel
31:47
memory he says in the bible that your
31:50
your angel's face is always before the
31:52
father remember that it says in the
31:53
bible oh yeah you always have more than
31:55
one you always have more than one
31:58
because one is always always with you
32:00
and so they'll take turns going before
32:02
the father sometimes they're saying
32:04
things or whatever he's calling them up
32:06
there and i've seen them
32:09
doing many things especially during a
32:11
meeting where they have mass miracles
32:13
they bring they're the ones who bring
32:14
the body parts down from heaven
32:16
your angel usually will get your body
32:19
part if you're lacking or need something
32:21
replaced or
32:23
if you've asked for uh like
32:25
help me with kindness i want more
32:26
kindness they'll the father will send a
32:29
deposit of kindness and they'll walk
32:30
through you and then part it into you
32:32
they'll literally hold it and walk
32:33
through you and put it inside of you in
32:35
your spirit
32:36
the uh i'm thinking of a specific
32:38
relative of mine i won't name it um
32:41
and they're walking away from the lord
32:43
and there's a whole bunch of new age
32:45
stuff going on and there's pictures on
32:47
the wall where they're doing this and
32:49
they're doing all these and they're
32:51
walking that's what they're doing
32:53
so what are their
32:54
angels have their do their angels leave
32:57
them because they're in this state do
32:59
their angels double up because they need
33:01
more help what what goes on
33:04
it depends on who's praying for those
33:06
people usually now if god has assigned
33:09
them to you your your guardian angel
33:11
comes while you're in the womb
33:13
it's waiting for you to be born
33:15
so they're with you before you get
33:17
involved in anything you have any
33:19
understanding of anything they're with
33:20
you from the time you're little and if
33:22
you see babies smile which i was holding
33:25
one the other night um they were looking
33:27
at my angel they couldn't take their
33:29
eyes off of my angel because i could see
33:31
my angel and my angels behind me or it
33:33
comes around me and they would look at
33:35
the angel continually i could see their
33:37
angels all the time they were right
33:38
there with that around that baby they
33:41
were somewhere in the room they had like
33:42
five different angels with them so
33:44
they're a prophet
33:46
they will be a prophet they're not gonna
33:48
become one they are one and so they have
33:50
more
33:51
depending on the assignment that god
33:53
gives you you have more angels if in a
33:56
different season in your life maybe you
33:57
normally have three he could send five
33:59
or ten more depending on where you're
34:01
going to be going for him or doing for
34:03
him so that changes but you always have
34:06
the ones he originally sent
34:08
waiting outside i see pregnant women all
34:10
the time with angels following them
34:12
around that is that babies angels so
34:15
they're with you from that time and a
34:17
lot of babies begin to smile they go
34:19
with looking at nothing and smiling no
34:20
they're looking at their own angels
34:22
and so uh the the angelic have a very
34:25
powerful assignment from god and it does
34:28
say he sends them to keep you and
34:29
protect you in all your ways
34:32
so most of the time it is sort of like a
34:35
protection thing
34:37
that they're assigned to you and
34:38
sometimes they've said whisper things in
34:40
your ear like make sure you stop don't
34:43
go if the lights change don't go yet
34:45
many times at your own angel saying that
34:48
to you
34:49
and of course the more of god you have
34:51
in you and uh people go i don't even
34:53
know what that means well do you
34:54
meditate about him do you talk to him
34:57
like he's actually there
34:58
people how do i build a relationship you
35:00
act like he's really there
35:02
and you talk to him just like as if you
35:04
could see him just tell him you know i
35:06
love you i'm so grateful to you for what
35:07
you've done i'm so excited about the
35:09
things that are about to take place in
35:11
the earth no matter what the news or
35:12
anyone else is saying you're believing
35:14
what god's timing is and the more you do
35:17
that the clearer you hear holy spirit
35:20
father of jesus christ
35:22
and i do know this the more that you
35:24
step out begin to believe what his word
35:27
says and then you live like you believe
35:29
it your spiritual ears will begin to be
35:33
open so my question on on this cat is
35:37
there are so you and i know
35:39
tons of people or stories about the same
35:43
that people who are called a high
35:45
calling in their life and something
35:47
happened and they began to just walk
35:49
away
35:50
and they began to experiment and they'll
35:53
one day they'll tell their story they
35:55
say i just was running away from god as
35:58
fast as i could go they'll say that so
36:00
when they're running away
36:03
and then in fact when they're what they
36:05
usually mean is i did this and i'm doing
36:07
this and i started doing that
36:09
what what are their angels
36:13
oh they don't leave
36:15
okay
36:16
they do not leave they're right there
36:18
beside you the whole time
36:20
and sometimes the choices you make
36:22
yourself as a person may get yourself in
36:25
a lot of trouble or maybe you begin to
36:28
reject the words of god i'm not saying
36:31
you abandon necessarily being a
36:33
christian it's like you're going more to
36:36
another another way like leaning on your
36:38
own understanding not what you learn
36:40
from the word and maybe you make
36:42
decisions where you yourself can get
36:44
hurt or whatever they double up what
36:46
they're doing for you i mean they don't
36:48
leave you they still try to influence
36:50
you
36:51
a lot of times they're shaking their
36:53
head i mean uh even they don't
36:56
sometimes they really do i see them roll
36:58
their eyes sometimes i think they're
37:00
saying the angels they have they have
37:02
personalities they're not robots
37:05
some will just begin to pray really hard
37:07
for you the other ones are like rolling
37:09
their eyes at you like come on
37:13
come on you need to you need to
37:14
understand you shouldn't be doing that
37:15
you shouldn't be going into that place
37:18
they will try to influence you if you go
37:20
into places that are really not good
37:21
they'll actually cover their eyes
37:24
wow and
37:26
they'll cover their eyes but they won't
37:27
leave you when
37:29
did you say
37:31
because we're talk about that our angels
37:33
do this they protect here
37:35
they stand and you know they block this
37:37
but did you say your angels pray for you
37:41
do angels pray so our angels pray like
37:44
we pray
37:46
they've got a prayer life as well is
37:48
that what you're saying life it's a
37:49
little bit different from ours
37:52
because they know the things the father
37:55
can do they know the things jesus christ
37:57
died for they'll begin to repeat what
37:59
the word has said and they will be
38:01
declaring the word over those people
38:03
that they have been assigned to they
38:05
don't just do it for anybody but the
38:07
ones that they were assigned to from the
38:08
time you know before they were born they
38:10
were sent to take them
38:12
when you die your guardian angel is the
38:14
one who escorts you to heaven whether
38:17
you're picked up in a chariot or where
38:19
you're picked up but some other way
38:20
there's many ways you can be transported
38:22
to heaven your own guardian angel when
38:24
you step out of this physical body and
38:26
your spirit man steps out the first
38:28
thing you'll see will be your own angel
38:31
good well well all right well um
38:34
this is a good question um this is
38:37
renee's asking i i he says i see or he i
38:40
can't tell i take care of my 98 year old
38:44
mother
38:45
who has dementia
38:46
who has dementia how can i lead her to
38:48
the lord i've tried to be simple but she
38:51
says quote what are you talking about
38:54
close quote
38:56
yeah when some people not everybody
38:59
i'd say that very carefully my mom is 90
39:02
she's sharp as attack people
39:04
and so um
39:05
it's just some people aren't some aren't
39:07
um what you do in that situation or i
39:10
can add something even more to that if
39:12
they're in the hospital and they're not
39:13
responding
39:14
you can speak to their spirit man
39:17
and i tell people there actually have
39:19
been people came back and get tested and
39:21
said even though i wasn't responding my
39:23
body wasn't responding i heard every
39:25
word you said their spirit may inherit
39:28
it i tell people don't ever stop
39:30
believing for their salvation don't ever
39:32
stop doing that and you can just say
39:34
very politely make sure you know jesus
39:36
christ
39:37
can can i help you pray to him
39:41
if they were born again and got born
39:42
again at a young age it's like god keeps
39:45
this
39:46
i don't want to say he has a hook in you
39:48
but it makes him you have a tie to him
39:51
you know it says that jesus is married
39:53
to the backslider right doesn't it say
39:55
that so even though you get off an area
39:57
you shouldn't be he doesn't leave you he
39:59
always has hope that you will recognize
40:02
him and go back to what you believed in
40:04
the beginning and so that's why your
40:06
angels will still pray and declare you
40:09
know to these people but as far as a
40:11
senior uh sometimes the closer they get
40:14
to 100 somewhere over 100 is still sharp
40:17
it depends on every single person is
40:19
different their soul processes things
40:21
differently some days are clearer than
40:24
other days so don't give up you know
40:27
speaking of being very gentle when you
40:28
speak to them whether and they're
40:30
already of the age while they're
40:31
sleeping is a good time to speak to them
40:34
that's good
40:35
does not ever sleep
40:37
and i i tell people still speak to them
40:39
still leave them in a prayer of
40:41
salvation if they're really
40:43
while they're asleep
40:44
please do that wow
40:47
you're serious you can lead a person
40:55
yes
40:56
and their spirit man can respond it will
41:00
totally respond and we ourselves have
41:03
heard i've lived in church my entire
41:04
life okay we were almost born on a pew i
41:06
tell people that's where we were every
41:09
service it was a six week six week
41:11
revival we were there every single
41:12
meeting uh that's where we lived it was
41:15
like our second home and so we heard a
41:17
lot of testimonies sometimes people miss
41:20
but we heard testimonies of people who
41:22
were in comas in the hospital and
41:24
they're and they weren't born again and
41:25
they their loved one would visit them
41:27
all the time they would put their hand
41:28
on them they would pray over them they
41:30
themselves would say now i believe that
41:32
you can hear me even though your flesh
41:34
can't respond i'm going to lead you in
41:36
this prayer and they would lead them in
41:38
the sinner's prayer like at least once
41:40
when they were coming to visit them and
41:42
now they they didn't die and go to
41:44
heaven these people lived they came back
41:46
and they said i heard you every time
41:50
you led me in that prayer i had to say
41:52
it now this was their spirit man even
41:54
though their flesh was then speaking
41:56
this was the actual person who came back
41:59
woke up out of the coma and said i heard
42:01
you say that every time he spoke to me
42:03
and they said thank you for not giving
42:04
up giving up on me but while i was out
42:08
my spirit man heard you and i received
42:10
christ
42:11
wow
42:12
you know there's no teaching about this
42:14
i mean this is wonderful news because i
42:17
didn't know you could lead someone to
42:18
the lord when they're in a coma or when
42:20
they're
42:21
when they're asleep that's phenomenal
42:23
cat i mean
42:25
your soul
42:26
you know your three parts right body
42:28
soul and spirit your soul never sleeps
42:32
your soul doesn't need to sleep it's a
42:34
spiritual thing your spirit man never
42:36
sleeps it's always awake and i encourage
42:40
people play some really powerful amazing
42:42
music in the room especially if people
42:44
are not feeling well the best thing you
42:46
can do
42:48
unless you if you're given a medicine
42:49
they've told you to give them medicine
42:51
this is before the whole virus thing i'm
42:53
not talking about that at all i'm not in
42:55
my opinions of that right now but
42:57
normally just not feeling well or maybe
42:59
the under doctor's care the best thing
43:01
you can do for that person is to play
43:04
the word of god or being spoken or to
43:07
play music that brings the presence of
43:10
god your spirit man and your soul will
43:12
get very strong because of that
43:15
but i always have encouraged people
43:17
since being young
43:19
don't give up on your family member and
43:21
please if you if you're standing for
43:22
their salvation
43:24
you'll find out later in heaven when you
43:26
see them there what your words spoke and
43:28
made a difference in their life so it's
43:30
important but again you can't you can't
43:33
sell the bad wicked evil things you're
43:35
saying if you're over here standing
43:36
right you're being double minded
43:39
yeah
43:40
you're staying in that gap you stay
43:42
there you declare over them i'm not
43:44
saying you have to pray pray
43:46
24 hours a day
43:47
back in the day you know i'm coming from
43:49
like born in the 50s people so i've seen
43:52
just about every move of god since the
43:53
50s there has been
43:55
and was a part of a lot of them and i'm
43:58
like i was surprised at what people
44:00
didn't understand god could do and and
44:03
would he actually do it and i'm like do
44:05
you not believe there is a god i mean i
44:07
think number one you really have to
44:09
believe when you receive christ it's he
44:12
steps inside of you he's there he's
44:15
actually with you all the time not just
44:17
your angels
44:19
and so i encourage people he's there
44:21
he's never going to leave yet says so
44:22
why not talk to him like i'm talking to
44:25
you like i can't see you but i feel like
44:27
i'm talking to thousands of people right
44:29
now when i speak and i'm serious like
44:32
steve said i'm serious everything god
44:34
taught me i had to live it that's how i
44:37
know these things work
44:39
but when when a mass of the body begins
44:42
to believe and live like he really is
44:45
and declare it and begin to speak to
44:47
things around you you'll be shocked how
44:50
different your life is you'll come home
44:52
walk into the presence of god because
44:54
you've invited a habitation of heaven by
44:57
what you're saying in your home where no
44:59
one's watching or looking what are you
45:02
watching what are you letting in your
45:03
home what are you letting come in from
45:05
the tv from the computer um it says in
45:08
the bible we'll be we will be held
45:10
account for every word
45:12
you know that we speak i'm not saying if
45:13
you're a believer you won't go to heaven
45:15
but
45:16
don't use wasteful things i don't spend
45:19
your time repeating what they're
45:21
advertising about hell going on in the
45:23
earth right now
45:24
are you talking more about god and his
45:27
plans and his power are you talking more
45:29
about the power of the enemy and that's
45:31
how fear gets into people if all you're
45:33
talking about is how afraid you are and
45:35
how wicked and bad and evil everything
45:37
is out there people don't even think
45:38
about god if i talk about the life of
45:40
god and his power and his plans that he
45:43
has for this earth he made it he held it
45:46
in his hands and made this earth he's
45:49
not ignoring anything he knows what's
45:51
going on in justice i just have to say
45:53
holy spirit saying yes
45:54
justice has already been released from
45:56
heaven
45:57
it's waiting to act
45:59
so why not tell your children ask your
46:02
children what is god saying to you can
46:04
you hear his voice he wants to speak to
46:06
you do you know god wants you to be
46:08
great for him that the invention
46:10
creativity that will happen in your
46:11
lifetime will be phenomenal
46:13
this little baby i was holding all i
46:15
said was powerful exciting things a
46:18
little baby like a month old
46:20
and that baby began to grin and almost
46:22
laugh at the words i was giving was life
46:25
to them
46:26
okay it was life to this little tiny
46:29
baby who who didn't really know anything
46:32
except that was somebody speaking light
46:34
and life to him and he didn't really
46:36
know me but it didn't matter i was
46:38
giving him what god was saying about him
46:40
and it was changing the way he responded
46:43
in seconds
46:45
so
46:47
what are you feeding your family with
46:49
your words
46:50
are you giving them life
46:52
are you empowering them inspiring them
46:55
to be something great for god regardless
46:57
of what's going on in this world this
46:59
world does not own you
47:01
okay you're in the hand of god if you
47:02
belong to him expect him expectancy with
47:06
god is just as powerful as reading the
47:08
word and praying expectancy
47:10
i say i ask for and receive expectancy
47:13
the expectancy and the excitement god
47:15
that you carry i ask for that and i bind
47:17
that to my soul and it's one of the
47:19
reasons why i say excited but if all
47:22
you're saying is did you hear what they
47:23
said here did you hear that now this is
47:25
what happened and don't say no this is
47:27
going to happen say i'm i'm not
47:28
tolerating any of this stuff being
47:30
forced i decide what god wants for me
47:33
i'm living in my life's going in in that
47:36
direction the only new normal for me
47:37
will be god invading my place that's
47:40
good that's good
47:42
to wrap up then let me i want to really
47:44
clarify this 98 year old mother who has
47:47
dementia which means
47:49
she just she's not there she may or may
47:51
not be there at all
47:53
she's yeah or if she remembers something
47:55
it's for 30 seconds i know my mom's
47:57
headed that way so if whether it's a 98
48:00
year old mother who has dementia like
48:02
this question
48:04
or a 10 year old or 20 year old
48:07
who has me who is so mentally challenged
48:10
that they they do not relate to language
48:13
as you and i know it
48:15
okay so they so as far as we know their
48:18
brain doesn't work
48:20
even in that case you while they're
48:23
asleep you can lead them to the lord
48:25
right
48:26
i will say this because i have to add
48:28
anyone who is um of an older age or even
48:32
like you said 20 if they're mentally
48:34
challenged
48:36
if their physical brain doesn't operate
48:38
like ours god treats them like a little
48:41
child
48:43
and and let me tell you even at the time
48:45
of their death he will present himself
48:47
to them
48:48
he will lead them to him himself
48:52
he is not an unjust god and if that was
48:55
if that's how they were born or
48:56
something happened to them and mentally
48:59
they can't process or they can't think
49:01
he does not hold that against them but
49:03
they are treated by god as a child as a
49:07
young child and he's not going to send
49:09
them to hell he will make sure they have
49:11
an opportunity to know him in the bible
49:14
it says i make myself known to every man
49:17
that means every human being
49:20
so that part i can tell you the mentally
49:22
challenged like that god knows that
49:25
they're like a child but i would totally
49:27
still speak to them and say jesus loves
49:30
you
49:31
if that's all you can get into them it's
49:33
going to go in their spirit it will
49:35
begin to actually affect them if you put
49:38
words of life in them god loves you he
49:40
sent you here uh to be with us you know
49:42
we love you god uh has plans for you one
49:46
day you'll get to see him in person
49:48
those are words of hope
49:50
well anytime hope uh
49:53
the hope brings glory to god which is in
49:56
the word of god christ in you is the
50:00
hope of glory that you saying words of
50:03
hope to people that draws the glory of
50:06
god and that can even bring healing it
50:08
can begin to change physically the way
50:10
their brain operates
50:12
and and they've even tested that on
50:14
plants just relating a plant who has no
50:17
real life a plant you speak kind words
50:20
to and encourage this plant i love that
50:22
you're growing how beautiful you are wow
50:25
really
50:26
they have proved scientifically
50:29
some plants that they're bashed and
50:31
falsely accused they did this is a real
50:34
i had many trials done in science labs
50:37
that plant died
50:39
but the one that had words of hope and
50:42
power and those released that plant
50:44
flourished these are living things not
50:47
with the soul but the living in their
50:50
words affected the plants how do you
50:53
think they're going to be in to affect
50:54
the soul of a person no matter what kind
50:57
of situation their physical man is in
51:00
their spirit man is made perfect their
51:02
spirit man is made perfect and your
51:05
spirit sometimes leaps for joy even if
51:08
your physical man doesn't understand it
51:10
so i have to say
51:12
these people who say you know it's
51:13
important what you say be kind to people
51:16
even some of them if they don't have an
51:17
understanding of god they have learned
51:19
their self
51:20
kindness and hope begin to change people
51:24
even people who aren't nice even people
51:27
with all their mental faculties it
51:29
matters what you say to people
51:31
and and i always try to find someone
51:34
some every day to be kind to or to help
51:36
or to give them hope and i don't know
51:39
these people and they don't even know
51:41
who i am but when you release words of
51:44
hope it like pierces the darkness
51:47
in a person and light begins to come
51:50
from the words you speak words look like
51:52
little missiles of light going into a
51:55
person's spirit
51:57
and will begin to affect their natural
51:59
man
52:01
that's good that's good now you we had
52:03
talked to they someone wrote here that
52:06
was episode 57 where you said there will
52:08
become
52:09
cities of light that will start to
52:11
happen
52:12
and the person's asking in reference to
52:14
that
52:15
is this something that we can look
52:17
forward to in our live lifetime and how
52:20
soon
52:21
if there's any concept you have as far
52:23
as when will this happen or how soon can
52:25
we look forward to cities of light
52:28
i absolutely expect that to happen
52:30
probably in most people's lifetime
52:33
um because i have to say god has talked
52:36
about a divine decade a double decade
52:39
which would be like 2000 i think that
52:41
was like 2000 2010 2000 2010 2020 2020
52:46
like to 2040
52:48
so many major changes are going to come
52:50
and i have been telling people watch for
52:53
the first three months of this year for
52:56
things to be seen and heard you haven't
52:58
seen or heard wow i'm i'm not saying the
53:01
whole the whole flip they call it flip
53:03
whatever you can call it it's actually a
53:05
turning more than is like a flip thing
53:08
but when you begin to see that the hand
53:10
god turning his hand
53:13
literally what you will begin to see in
53:15
these next few months is so much
53:18
darkness will come to light there's a
53:20
lot of darkness out there a lot of it's
53:22
still hidden people are getting away
53:24
with things but in these first three
53:25
months you will see
53:27
major people exposed and never thought
53:30
they would be exposed and and that is
53:32
very key to what he is doing in the
53:35
earth now but i fully expect regions of
53:39
regions of light to exist on the earth
53:41
because i was taken into the regions of
53:43
light and i do happen to know this city
53:45
i live in will become a region of light
53:48
he showed me at one point demons leaving
53:51
the city like dust they were leaving
53:54
like dust because the glory of god was
53:56
beginning to be embedded here and coming
53:58
from the people who live here
54:01
begin to operate and what he has called
54:03
them to operate in and i know there's a
54:06
lot of people coming to florida what
54:07
they don't understand and i'm laughing
54:10
at certain people who just bought
54:11
property here from the left
54:14
they're stepping into the greatest
54:15
battle station on earth god said florida
54:17
was the battle station of the host on
54:19
earth so they're stepping into a very
54:22
dangerous place
54:24
yeah yeah there's some people that'll
54:27
probably lose that property that they're
54:29
and other people
54:31
other people that will that will join
54:34
join the kingdom you know so let's see
54:36
um this is just let me add one more
54:39
thing go ahead yes please when he showed
54:41
me this about this city um we were sent
54:44
here back in 61 though we have no
54:46
intention of leaving by the way there's
54:48
150 of us people um
54:50
and some of them are rednecks i don't
54:52
think i'm a redneck but i tell you what
54:54
i am a manifested daughter of god and i
54:55
already know that if you don't like it
54:57
why don't you start living it okay i'm
54:59
not against you being that it's what you
55:02
choose but he caught me up into space
55:06
over the earth by the way it was round
55:09
there you go again the holy spirit
55:11
always does that i love it there's no
55:13
flat earth he never made a flat earth
55:15
heaven is not flat earth is a shadow of
55:18
heaven god's home is a world a whole
55:20
world bigger than our probably of
55:22
everything that you can see out there
55:23
but he caught me up and he had put a
55:25
grid around the earth like a grid you
55:27
know people know what a great is up
55:29
above the earth and there were states
55:32
were lighting up he began to light up
55:34
these states
55:35
that i saw and he said these will all be
55:37
regions of light and there were more
55:39
regions of light than of darkness really
55:43
oh yeah more regions of light because
55:45
the body will begin to get and
55:46
understand who they are begin to operate
55:48
in the fullness of what christ gave them
55:51
and the more they see it happen the more
55:52
they'll get so inspired and excited and
55:55
then they become empowered because of
55:58
running after jesus christ i think there
56:00
also will be
56:01
many sightings of christ now in saying
56:04
all that the enemy will be out there
56:06
trying to demonstrate he is somebody and
56:08
he has something which at one point a
56:10
lot of people will laugh at because
56:12
there's so much of god around that's how
56:15
different it's going to be i saw regions
56:17
of light i told people already las vegas
56:19
will be a region of las vegas and reno
56:21
will both be a region of light i saw
56:23
california as a region of light people
56:25
so no matter what's going on there now
56:28
they better change or they won't want to
56:30
stay because you know what the devil
56:31
doesn't want to stay where a lot of god
56:33
is he just doesn't want to and it what
56:36
will happen is so many people will begin
56:37
to run to god and demonstrate and the
56:40
miraculous that will be happening the
56:42
new inventions and stuff this is what's
56:44
coming this is going to be your new norm
56:47
so why not prepare your children that
56:49
greatness is coming they're going to be
56:50
a part of this don't don't ever let fear
56:52
be put in your children by lies that are
56:54
being told everywhere you will see some
56:57
of the best the greatest justice you've
56:59
ever seen on the earth but on the other
57:00
side of that the greatest celebration
57:03
the greatest invention and uh people
57:05
being inspired people caring about each
57:08
other some churches will not make a
57:10
denomination anymore they're just going
57:12
to belong to jesus christ not that there
57:14
won't be some organizations out there uh
57:16
i'm just saying life will be so
57:19
different
57:20
that people will want to know christians
57:23
that is how different it will be from
57:25
now they won't be listening to the left
57:28
it will start to slipped it out they
57:30
won't be listening to things that are
57:31
the darkness or doom and gloom or the
57:33
takeover theory that isn't what's going
57:35
to happen okay the only theory that's
57:37
going to happen is jesus christ the
57:39
plans of jesus christ the timeline of
57:42
god and that's why he shows me things so
57:44
i can empower you by these words and if
57:47
you're from the other side you don't
57:48
like me it's too late people you're
57:50
filled with the anointing you can't get
57:52
rid of it
57:55
that's really good by the way that's a
57:56
really good word about california
57:58
because i was raised in california and
58:00
i've been thinking man maybe i need to
58:02
because i just thought one day when i
58:04
buy my uh vacation home okay that's not
58:08
now but one day
58:10
um
58:11
i'd like it to be in california but i
58:13
thought maybe i better change that maybe
58:15
that needs to be in florida where
58:16
there's actual freedom but you're saying
58:19
kevin he never played both places steve
58:21
it's okay okay that sounds good you know
58:24
what i need is one of those portal doors
58:27
that i can walk through
58:29
so hey by the way speaking of portal
58:32
doors you said in heaven there's doors
58:35
that you walk through and then suddenly
58:36
you're in another place
58:38
cat is there a time in the future where
58:42
where there's a reality on earth or are
58:45
there seers that kind of do that now on
58:48
earth where they walk through a place
58:50
and suddenly they're in singapore or
58:52
suddenly they're in you know whatever
58:55
timbuktu have you heard about that kind
58:57
of thing
58:58
i have heard about it actually it's been
59:00
several years since i heard the people
59:02
now
59:03
and there's a lot into saying that whole
59:05
thing and i always take time to explain
59:08
i'm not saying every single person would
59:10
be able to do that that's not what i'm
59:12
saying and and i'm saying some of them
59:14
didn't even know how it happened i know
59:17
how that happens in the spirit but i'm
59:19
not saying every person who god just
59:21
inspires you and he'll say step in there
59:23
and they'll open the door and step in
59:24
and they won't be in that same room
59:26
they'll be somewhere else sometimes
59:27
it'll be just that simple
59:29
i do know there are people that
59:30
understand about going in and out of the
59:33
spirit realm but you have to be very
59:35
careful i'm not saying that out of fear
59:37
i'm saying that out of wisdom and let
59:39
the holy spirit guide you and all that
59:41
there's some people who think well we
59:42
can all do this and then they get they
59:44
forget who jesus christ is they forget
59:46
he's a part of this and now they have to
59:49
say it will happen more and more but yes
59:52
it does that's how people travel in
59:53
heaven a lot of them will step into a
59:56
door or into beams of light and they
59:58
will take them to a whole different
59:59
place in heaven there absolutely is
60:01
going to be new ways to travel like
60:03
trains will run on beams of light not on
60:06
rails on the ground that is absolutely
60:08
going to happen on this that's here on
60:09
earth and you're saying that's here
60:11
here on earth that will happen here
60:13
they'll have ways to like hold highways
60:15
that will be from um
60:18
i don't understand because you know i
60:20
had a 12th grade education decided to
60:21
disappoint you people uh i've i've
60:24
graduated from the college in heaven but
60:26
but not on the earth okay and it's okay
60:29
to pursue a higher education just don't
60:30
let that place tell you there is no god
60:33
just very where you go but i can tell
60:36
you yes i was shown things that would
60:38
literally be created on the earth and i
60:41
do know this and will still say five
60:43
major diseases including cancer will no
60:45
longer exist on this earth and that will
60:48
not be very far down the road it may not
60:51
i'm not saying it'd be 10 20 years down
60:52
the road at all i think those are going
60:54
to happen probably within the next
60:57
several years maybe between five and ten
60:59
years these five major diseases won't be
61:01
on the earth that alone will change
61:03
people's lives new ways to transport
61:06
that won't cost a lot of money energy
61:08
comes down from up in space
61:10
captured and brought to this earth will
61:12
not be very far down the road that that
61:14
happens and it may not be in somebody's
61:16
lifetime but i was shown i saw a lot of
61:20
buildings and things that remained the
61:21
same i saw a lot of things that were
61:23
different i've been taking you know five
61:25
years in the future 15
61:27
30 50 100
61:30
almost 150 years and guess what the
61:32
tribulation hadn't happened people
61:34
stopped trying to ride out on the
61:35
rapture rug the loading state the
61:38
greater things you will see happen on
61:40
the earth if i was somebody well i am
61:42
somebody
61:43
i want to be here as long as he has me
61:46
here
61:47
because i can make a difference in the
61:50
lives of people and i already know
61:52
what's coming
61:53
and the medical field will change
61:55
educational field will change the
61:56
business world will majorly change uh
61:59
and even the christian world itself
62:02
would begin to actually act like there
62:04
is a god people other nations and high
62:07
level people will seek people out to
62:09
find out where they got revelation from
62:11
and and and actually take it and act on
62:14
it so there's things hidden in the
62:16
ground like well not just the glory but
62:18
i'm talking about natural things hidden
62:20
that we will discover that will help
62:22
improve our life in this world and this
62:25
is god's plan for these days he chose
62:28
you in a powerful time on the earth all
62:30
the stuff going on around you
62:33
is about exposing evil
62:35
it is not about evil taking over you
62:38
know and cat uh you know who kathy
62:41
walters is and she was a friend of
62:43
arthur burt who's gone home to be at the
62:45
lord bert with a teeth there's a burke
62:47
with a k we're not talking about that
62:49
one is arthur burt with the t he's one
62:51
of them that said 2012
62:53
uh was the beginning of
62:56
the kingdom age he's one of those
62:59
but before he went and he he tells the
63:01
story about he was in an airport
63:03
and and he wanted to use the restroom
63:05
and god said take your bags with you to
63:08
the air to the bathroom he goes lord i
63:10
don't need take your bags with you to
63:13
the bathroom so he goes into the
63:15
bathroom with his bags he comes out and
63:17
he's in another country
63:19
airplane you know so that that's not
63:22
technology that per se that's that's an
63:25
encounter that's a supervision
63:28
you know josh uh i can't think of he
63:30
plays the keyboard
63:32
josh joshua people know who i'm talking
63:34
about um he's a he's a young youngish
63:37
man i mean he's probably 40s or
63:39
something but he's been transported
63:42
philip the philip the deacon all he was
63:44
was a deacon and he was transported so
63:47
that is going to happen more and more
63:49
isn't it yes it will absolutely happen
63:52
more and more yes it will
63:54
and we've heard you and i have heard and
63:56
as we wrap up here you know i've heard i
63:58
think man well
64:00
johnson who said that you know god took
64:03
him
64:04
forward in time
64:06
this is a few years ago to 2022
64:09
and and no one was wearing masks you
64:11
remember that story he said no one was
64:13
wearing this and he said
64:15
and he asked someone what and he
64:17
realized he was
64:18
he said what year is this and the person
64:20
said it's 20 22 and he said who's the
64:23
president
64:24
and they said donald trump so you know
64:27
i've been looking forward to that
64:28
because god took him there
64:30
you know and
64:31
kat let me ask you a question about
64:34
that
64:35
make this kind of the final one you've
64:37
said
64:38
god has taken you
64:41
and shown you the future when he shows
64:44
you that there's these different kinds
64:46
of encounters one is you're with him and
64:48
then he just shows you the future he
64:50
takes you there another one is he
64:52
transports you
64:55
as he literally transports you which
64:58
which is it when he when god takes you
65:00
to show you the future
65:03
um
65:04
well most of the time if he starts
65:05
talking about the future he literally
65:07
takes me there okay like i'm there like
65:10
i'm walking on the ground i see all the
65:12
stuff around me i hear the sights and
65:14
the aromas i see the activity
65:16
and
65:17
when that's happened to you you should
65:19
never forget that you should never
65:21
forget that
65:22
but um he's also taken to me to other
65:25
places he's taken me backward in time
65:27
like literally transported me i felt
65:30
myself moving one time and i was taken
65:33
back to the tomb of christ after the
65:35
stone had been rolled away i actually
65:38
did that and was in the garden that was
65:40
before i was with you all and elijah
65:42
listen we visited that same place i saw
65:45
the same two angels there
65:48
that were there when i was taken back
65:50
wow those angels were still there and
65:53
you know they were because when they
65:54
came to look and they said why are you
65:56
looking for the living
65:57
among the dad remember those angels have
65:59
said that those are the same angels who
66:00
were still posted there i saw them there
66:03
when we went to israel uh just a couple
66:05
years ago
66:06
that's amazing by the way i just
66:08
remembered it's joshua mills is the is
66:10
the name i was trying to remember uh
66:12
joshua mills he's a great great person
66:14
and he sought the
66:16
encounters
66:18
he'll describe how he sought the
66:20
encounters other people like yourself
66:23
you've said i've never sought the
66:24
encounters if i remember right but
66:27
joshua is one of those the reason i kind
66:29
of appreciate that side is because
66:33
um well first of all because i've never
66:35
been
66:35
transported in time so i'm thinking if i
66:38
get permission to at least see the
66:40
encounter maybe i'll do it but anyway
66:44
he tells a story about walking through
66:46
walls and starting to walk through walls
66:48
and it freaked him out
66:50
he pulled back but yeah we have amazing
66:52
times ahead of us amazing feelings well
66:56
i guess that's our time tell uh
66:58
tell folks how they can get a hold of
67:00
your website we've got
67:01
revealingheaven.com on the screen what
67:03

03:54
for a long time i'm i'm pinching myself
03:56
that i'm even that god's put me here to
03:59
even be doing this i mean it's it's like
04:01
is this real god
04:03
but um in 2017 jeff if you want to pull
04:06
up that picture i went to her first
04:08
warrior women's conference in florida
04:12
and uh there's my mom with the dark hair
04:15
there's me there's cat and my sister and
04:18
we all went to see you cat and i
04:20
remember during this conference
04:23
you said to us something incredible you
04:25
said every woman that's here there's a
04:28
hallway in heaven where you're there's a
04:30
photo of you and your name that you were
04:33
part of the first warrior women's
04:35
conference i'll never forget that you
04:37
said that because
04:38
when i first started um
04:40
following you i was i was really hungry
04:42
for more and more of jesus more and more
04:44
of truth more and more of the reality of
04:46
who jesus is and cat you've taught me so
04:49
much about cleansing my soul and so much
04:52
about the lord and just really helped
04:53
deepen my connection with him so thank
04:55
you
04:56
um it's just it's so exciting to have
04:58
you on here so let's bring on kat kerr
05:01
for today's show
05:03
did you did you get a little laugh out
05:05
of that picture
05:07
no um there are many many many pictures
05:10
we all had taken together during the
05:13
event but
05:14
um
05:15
i i love the faculty women so powerful
05:20
and the holy spirit always gives me
05:22
little tips throughout the day without
05:24
even asking for them and he said
05:28
uh by the way i need to add something
05:30
else besides that well i think jen's at
05:32
one point is going to be speaking
05:34
somewhere and she decided she's going to
05:35
speak um
05:37
uh like something about the difference
05:40
between men and women even though she's
05:41
not married you know she's lived in like
05:43
a tribe forever she's got seven brothers
05:46
and uh a lot of it's hilarious and this
05:49
is about the difference in men and women
05:50
this whole thing i'm gonna say
05:52
uh that um
05:54
that she knows all the inside stuff okay
05:57
she knows a lot about guys and how they
05:59
think
06:00
maybe they should think a lot harder
06:02
before they do things that type of thing
06:07
so but god does have a powerful things
06:09
he does with women and we are different
06:12
okay we're steadfast you're not going to
06:14
pull us away from something we're going
06:15
to be like you know like a lion going
06:18
after something and uh especially don't
06:20
touch anybody we know or we love you're
06:23
in trouble and the holy spirit and i
06:25
were talking about her discussing those
06:27
things with people one day and the holy
06:29
spirit said you know
06:31
uh
06:32
the lord had more women following him
06:34
than men
06:36
oh yes you know why he'd never get lost
06:40
he knew where everything was he'd always
06:41
have food to eat and he'd have people on
06:44
your side how about that
06:49
it is true women went with them
06:51
everywhere they went
06:52
and uh and that was known so when jesus
06:55
traveled by foot people
06:58
he could have gone on the spirit realm
06:59
but then what was the point nobody would
07:00
see him right he'd be right there with
07:02
him but nobody would see him but he when
07:04
he traveled they would put up camp
07:06
sometimes if they couldn't find lodging
07:09
and jesus paid for the lodging no matter
07:11
where they went because guess what he
07:12
was not poor that's just for free
07:15
he became poor that we might be rich he
07:17
became poor because he left heaven okay
07:20
he didn't live poor on the earth but by
07:22
heaven's standards he was but he had had
07:25
a lot more women with them guess what
07:27
they never argued they never second
07:29
guessed i never doubted
07:32
you know doubting thomas i just had that
07:34
for free and for whatever but the women
07:37
the captain is going for him they made
07:40
the plans when he was going into the
07:41
next place they made preparations
07:44
because you remember when when adam was
07:46
created god well maybe i'll think about
07:49
this okay now
07:51
i better send help i better send big
07:54
help i'll name her woman like wow look
07:57
at this man it's better than the table
08:02
this was all from the holy spirit while
08:03
i was just in the kitchen i was trying
08:06
so hard not to laugh at him that's why
08:07
they call him the drama king but it is
08:09
absolutely true he had his 12 disciples
08:12
but they had they had a lot of women
08:14
that traveled with him to make sure they
08:15
all got fed took care of the
08:17
preparations and stuff and
08:19
jesus um
08:21
said jesus loved having them with him
08:23
because he always had so many on his
08:25
side how about that
08:28
amen so women are powerful tools in
08:31
god's hands because they were press in
08:33
you know i think they don't have a
08:35
problem being intimate or personal
08:38
with the father with the son of the holy
08:39
spirit men need you need to break that
08:41
wall down and you just get in that place
08:43
too
08:44
uh that you hear very clearly and in
08:46
these days things that never been done
08:49
before we're about to step into them and
08:52
i need to add this for free the holy
08:54
spirit said in the bible when it says uh
08:57
that there is no difference in male and
08:59
female let's talk about in the spirit
09:01
realm in dominion in authority in the
09:04
spirit there is no difference between a
09:07
male or female that means they all can
09:10
rule equally in great authority and
09:12
power no matter whether you're a man or
09:15
a woman you still have the same level of
09:17
authority can run after all of it
09:19
we can all be kings priests and lords
09:23
in the kingdom which jesus talked about
09:25
all the time so there you go there's a
09:26
plug for women
09:28
i love you
09:32
so all the warrior women yeah
09:35
i know there's many people watching that
09:36
was probably at those uh that conference
09:38
too screaming i think it's wonder woman
09:41
but we were on behalf of the lord
09:44
we were watching we wore we warned in
09:47
those things i mean we've bored and
09:48
every one of them was so powerful i
09:50
think one time uh women were there from
09:53
40 countries in one of the events it's
09:55
like like the second or third one and we
09:57
all declared over every single country
10:00
and i know that even in the time right
10:02
now god won't forget us declaring over
10:04
those countries
10:06
so anyway i'm so happy you were there
10:09
and uh i don't know if you were there at
10:11
the time that we actually had the photo
10:12
machine
10:14
that was set up and uh we took pictures
10:17
with like everything it was like 700
10:19
women that took hours but it was so much
10:21
fun
10:22
well that's one thing i i loved about
10:24
going because you just we could come up
10:26
and talk to you after and you would take
10:28
pictures with us and you're just so down
10:30
to earth i mean you are like you are on
10:32
here you're just down to earth
10:34
very genuine loving person such a gentle
10:37
humble spirit um you're very strong and
10:40
powerful in the lord while you're
10:41
ministering but when i come up to meet
10:44
you you're you've extremely humble and
10:46
gentle and that really marked me um when
10:49
i first met you so thank you for saying
10:51
yes to jesus and thank you for all you
10:53
give to the body of christ do you have
10:56
do you have any updates that you want to
10:58
share with us um oh wow are there
11:01
updates people
11:04
yay
11:09
i i told people
11:11
at the end of us here to start watching
11:13
the first three months of this year the
11:16
first three months there will be so much
11:19
exposure
11:20
uh just in the news i mean it's going to
11:23
be the reality that it's happening and
11:26
there's some places some news uh feeds
11:28
aren't even hiding what's going on
11:31
but several countries okay
11:34
not talking about america at this moment
11:36
but several countries have dumped
11:38
including england uh and mostly around
11:41
the uk the other ones will follow but
11:44
england has totally dumped all mandates
11:48
they're not doing the vaccines they're
11:49
not doing the mass thing the social
11:51
distancing they have decided to have
11:54
their country back and that's what they
11:55
said
11:56
we're getting back to real life they
11:58
found out in their test
12:00
that the people who recovered faster by
12:03
the way
12:04
from when they did get that virus were
12:06
the ones who hadn't had the vaccine
12:09
this is big news everywhere not not
12:12
not with a bunch of us knew it
12:14
that you were better off uh just with
12:17
your natural immunities you know facing
12:20
that thing and some maybe some other um
12:22
homeopathic things which means natural
12:24
things but they when they found out when
12:27
that report was given to the top person
12:29
in in london in in europe
12:33
they said forget it we're ditching it
12:35
all and this should be in the major news
12:37
lines already they're ditching it all
12:39
they're not taking anybody's universe
12:42
universal mandates forget that happening
12:45
they said people were better off they're
12:46
happier they think that kids should be
12:48
able to smile at each other uh see their
12:51
families and hug each other
12:53
and and just let whatever takes its
12:55
course you know people who don't know
12:57
this um the flu at one point uh back
13:01
before this thing came up i think they
13:02
were calling everything the virus i just
13:05
have to say that and that is absolute
13:07
truth i know people went to the doctors
13:09
and they saw that it was on the records
13:11
and make them erase it because they had
13:13
just had the flu they had a head cold
13:16
anything that they were told in the
13:18
medical community they had to put it
13:20
down as that as proof that it was still
13:22
around
13:23
i'm not saying it's not there but i'm
13:25
saying people virus
13:27
not disease not a plague
13:30
and that is the truth that's how you
13:32
have to say it stop calling it a disease
13:34
or a plague it's not
13:36
okay the flu is a virus there's
13:38
different viruses that come around
13:40
seasonally
13:41
and i'm not making fun of it because i
13:43
know there's people who lost their lives
13:45
mainly probably from the vaccine or how
13:48
they were handled during that time but
13:50
i'm telling you the uk
13:52
especially london is not having anything
13:55
to do with it literally i think as of
13:58
today
13:59
they're ditching it all and the masks
14:02
are going to be taken off the kids in
14:03
school in the universities isn't this
14:06
awesome news i am so excited now if you
14:10
feel like you have to wear a mask and
14:12
then wear it but i think we here in
14:14
america should have the right over our
14:17
own lives not to be forced or controlled
14:21
when we are free
14:22
maybe those people don't want to be free
14:24
who are mandating it although i think a
14:26
lot of them have lived a lot freer than
14:28
the people in this country you're about
14:30
to see major major changes happen in our
14:33
own country
14:34
i do know that one thing was just put
14:36
forth about demanding people have the uh
14:40
the uh the vaccine or they lose their
14:42
jobs i think you're about to see that
14:44
dumped really fast coming up especially
14:47
with uh you know the the europe uh
14:49
getting involved in this stuff one other
14:51
country
14:52
it could be switzerland i think possibly
14:54
that was brought up but i'm getting this
14:57
is not was it was inside information but
14:59
now it's known information because they
15:02
actually put it in the news uh the the
15:05
head of the um
15:06
uh of london saying we're not doing this
15:08
anymore it's over as far as we're
15:10
concerned it's gonna be life with
15:13
freedom in it
15:14
hallelujah thank you jesus
15:17
we know that's the lord thank you lord
15:20
thank you god
15:21
where the spirit of the lord is there's
15:23
liberty so we thank you holy spirit for
15:25
moving for all those precious people in
15:28
london and over those precious children
15:30
and we declare the same thing over
15:32
america freedom
15:34
unmask the children freedom thank you
15:37
holy spirit for it um it's it's shifting
15:40
and changing and it's coming here in its
15:42
fullness so we thank you god
15:45
is there anything else that you
15:47
want to share do you want to get into
15:48
the questions i think that was the main
15:51
thing i think the only other thing
15:53
it may not hit the headline yet but it's
15:55
about to
15:56
that the the military and this has
15:59
already been released in many different
16:01
places not that you'll may see it on our
16:03
news but our own military have been
16:05
doing their own covert operations it's
16:08
not covert anymore uh whether they'll
16:10
allow it to be said or not but they've
16:12
been doing tests on the vaccine from day
16:15
one their cells and this is what happens
16:18
though when evil tries to take over they
16:21
overlook a lot of things they think they
16:22
already have under control
16:24
not knowing excuse me
16:30
i'm so excited
16:32
not knowing when you try to take a
16:34
country that is free you're going to
16:36
have the worst days of your life trying
16:38
to do that because i've lived in this
16:41
country since i was born obviously
16:43
and uh i know this about americans you
16:46
push him too hard and they're going to
16:48
start saying we're not doing this okay
16:51
where's your million million army come
16:54
to try to come and get us it's never
16:56
going to happen they operate in fear
16:58
i think those in fear right now a lot of
17:01
the ones trying to push things on us or
17:03
hide things from us but the truth will
17:06
be made known because you're right the
17:08
truth will make you free
17:11
amen
17:12
well let's get into the questions
17:14
there's a lot of wonderful questions you
17:15
guys are so all the viewers are so
17:17
creative in their questions reading
17:19
through them i'm like oh they're so good
17:21
and i like it i love it because when we
17:23
all come together and with our different
17:25
questions and ask them it taps into
17:27
different parts of us we haven't
17:29
yet it gives us revelation deeper
17:31
revelation when we come all together
17:33
so the first question i have um is from
17:36
me because
17:38
all the logic streams people were like
17:41
it's the benefit of being god with cat
17:42
you get to ask her your own questions
17:44
and i was like
17:47
when you're in the throne room and
17:49
there's the altar and the seven blazing
17:51
torches in front of the throne god says
17:53
he's an all-consuming fire his angels in
17:56
his word he says he makes him minister
17:58
he makes them ministers as flames of
18:00
fire
18:01
does like just on earth you know
18:03
sometimes when an angel comes in the
18:05
room how the side of your face and your
18:07
body can get really hot yes
18:10
is it the same way in the throne room do
18:12
you when they come and stand beside you
18:14
do you still feel that heat that
18:16
radiates off
18:19
you feel even more so i tell people
18:21
sometimes i feel like
18:23
not i don't want to think people think
18:25
i'm in pain
18:26
um
18:27
i don't mean it that way but i feel like
18:29
i could melt sometimes
18:31
it's so extreme but it's a different
18:33
kind of fire it's a different kind of
18:36
burning and most of it starts on the
18:39
inside of you before it gets to the
18:40
outside of you uh your spirit man now
18:44
when i'm taken to heaven i'm in my
18:45
spirit man i my body is not there i've
18:48
never been caught up in my body at all
18:51
it always stays behind my family's
18:53
evidence of that they'll come in to say
18:55
something to me and i just won't move i
18:57
won't respond
18:58
i'm not even breathing but i'm still
19:00
alive don't worry holy spirit just
19:02
climbs inside of me keeps my body alive
19:04
uh this is their plan this is the
19:06
trinity's plan to catch me up and show
19:07
me so they keep me while my spirit man
19:10
is in heaven but even my spirit man
19:13
feels like it's burning uh because of
19:15
the presence of and that burning is love
19:18
that's the highest level of fire is the
19:21
love
19:23
and yes it does come from the father now
19:25
i do want to say something
19:28
about the whole thing about the angels
19:30
it does say his angels causes ministers
19:32
to become flames of fire uh when you're
19:35
baptized in fire and this is also tied
19:37
into bapti baptism and fire the angelic
19:41
are part of that are part of the
19:43
invitations of the baptism and fire and
19:45
i mean holy spirit was the first one to
19:47
carry it down we know it came down here
19:50
we know in the book of acts they all
19:51
were hit and had flames on their heads
19:54
how would you love to do that people
19:56
yeah it was so consuming and i was in
19:59
israel and i was in the upper room and
20:01
when i walked in being a seer i saw the
20:04
portal the holy spirit opened when he
20:06
came in and brought the fire
20:08
and there is an open portal in the upper
20:10
room that has flames still around the
20:12
whole edges of that thing and that's
20:15
exactly where holy spirit came in and
20:16
brought the fire from heaven for the
20:18
first time and it was placed inside the
20:21
people to such a measure that it was on
20:23
them but fire is what makes you bold get
20:27
ready when that baptism and fire comes
20:29
it'll burn every care concern
20:32
every every fear you ever thought you
20:34
could ever have you won't even be
20:35
fearful after that you are so consumed
20:38
with with the living god and our god
20:41
yeah he is filled with fire let me tell
20:43
you and that's how the rainbows made
20:45
from him from the stones of fire that
20:47
abide inside the father and then the
20:50
glory uh it hits it and then the waves
20:52
of the rainbow come in and out of him
20:55
but no matter where you go in heaven you
20:57
will experience that same intensity uh
21:00
even more so when you're with jesus
21:02
himself his eyes when you look at his
21:04
eyes in heaven they look like flames of
21:06
fire it mentions that in the bible too
21:08
so people try to change things
21:11
scriptures that they don't understand
21:12
don't change anything people don't take
21:15
what's always been there those people
21:17
from the way past knew what they were
21:18
talking about they probably had
21:20
encounters their self uh when it says in
21:23
him we live we move we have our being
21:26
the prophets and poets of old
21:29
talked about those things
21:31
so actually when it says in him we live
21:33
we move we have our being that was
21:34
inside the father that's what the
21:36
scripture was talking about this
21:37
revelation we lived in him before you
21:40
were here okay you played on the stones
21:42
of fire you swim in the river of life
21:44
that comes from him
21:46
this is who you are
21:48
okay you're not just some weak person
21:50
trying to get by and stop saying you're
21:52
no sinner saved by grace you are filled
21:55
with the love of god you have no sins
21:57
anymore you're filled with his power
21:59
with his presence and his purposes in
22:02
the earth and the more you believe that
22:04
the more you believe something and
22:06
receive it the easier it is to get
22:08
things from god to understand things
22:09
from god
22:13
yeah that's amazing just even thinking
22:16
about
22:17
the
22:18
heat and the glory and the presence and
22:21
the consuming love of god it can
22:23
overwhelm you
22:25
in in your spirit here on earth also can
22:28
we go to the throne room whenever we
22:30
want to when we're in heaven or
22:33
how does that work
22:35
you can go anytime you want to and
22:37
there's no time in heaven i know when
22:40
sean bach arrived he was there for a
22:43
long time he didn't even care about
22:46
seeing his mansion when he first got
22:48
there he was so consumed
22:50
with love from the father and from the
22:52
son many times when i was caught up
22:55
there to the throne room he was john
22:57
park was still in the throne
23:00
he's left now uh to go see all of his
23:03
things that that the lord prepared for
23:05
him
23:06
but um it's such a powerful place yes
23:09
you can come you can come whenever you
23:11
want to everyone who goes to heaven
23:14
you're there by the grace of god but
23:16
because you repented right you don't get
23:18
any holier in heaven so if god if you
23:22
repented of your sins and you're in
23:24
heaven there's nothing to keep you from
23:26
going to the throne room ever you can go
23:28
there and be in his presence you're
23:29
there with sometimes masses of people
23:31
celebrating
23:32
um sometimes they're dancing sometimes
23:34
the father sharing revelation with them
23:37
sometimes you sit in these huge circles
23:39
around the throne
23:41
uh the throne is round so this makes
23:43
sense to me there's four sets of steps
23:46
going up to the throne so no matter what
23:47
side you're on you can still run up
23:49
there it is high and lifted up it's not
23:51
like you're gonna walk up three feet and
23:53
be there be there but all the way up
23:55
you're having these encounters of his
23:57
presence all the way up to the the
23:59
throne where he's seated and his son is
24:01
next to him
24:03
hallelujah
24:04
oh i can't wait oh my spirit gets all
24:07
excited like paul talks about you know
24:09
we long for that
24:10
time with him uh so a question that many
24:14
people have asked is uh steve last week
24:17
kat you mentioned advice um that she
24:20
gave you i guess you gave steve advice
24:22
to help with sleeping and could pat
24:25
explain
24:26
more about the rest of god and what
24:28
people can declare to help them sleep
24:32
yes
24:32
it does mention in the bible and people
24:34
go why don't you give references because
24:36
i want you to look it up
24:39
i mean you should look up i mean you can
24:41
search for
24:42
like the love of god or the rest of the
24:44
lord it depends of course on the
24:45
translations i'm sure that if you look
24:48
at the king james you're probably going
24:50
to find it in there for sure because
24:51
they don't change things i mean they
24:52
didn't change a lot of stuff
24:54
and i know people didn't like you know
24:56
the the way that the wording was and
24:58
stuff like that like
25:00
i guess an old english style type thing
25:02
but let me tell you if it's a unicorn
25:05
they called it the unicorn people in the
25:07
bible in the king james version and it's
25:09
one of my favorite i read many versions
25:11
but that's one of my favorites because
25:13
they didn't change those words so it
25:15
talks about the rest of the lord and um
25:18
i know people who've experienced that i
25:20
use jesse to plant us all the time
25:22
because he talked about it he had been
25:24
ministering everywhere for and he still
25:26
does wow jesse's still out there doing
25:29
it and that jesse duplantis is hilarious
25:32
he lived a very strange unusual life
25:35
growing up
25:36
didn't know god or anything and had an
25:38
encounter i mean he had an encounter and
25:40
uh but he had a praying mama and let me
25:43
tell you what she didn't let go of him
25:44
so all you praying moms keep it up
25:46
so anyway he was traveling he was very
25:49
getting weary and he checked into his
25:51
hotel room and he's supposed to be at
25:53
the meeting place and he never showed up
25:57
he came the next day and told people
25:58
what happened he had he had been plowing
26:01
and out there working and ministering
26:02
and and the holy spirit would you know
26:05
impress him you need to rest you need to
26:06
rest and i guess heaven got tired of him
26:09
not resting
26:10
he was in his room and an angel appeared
26:13
in jesse's room
26:15
and he came up and he either touched him
26:17
or put his hand over him he said the
26:19
rest of the lord upon you and he fell
26:21
backwards on his bed and slept like 20
26:24
hours
26:25
oh my gosh that's awesome
26:28
it really does work it does work and you
26:31
declare it you can even say i declare i
26:33
won't say i'm not i'm not saying this
26:35
over me now i'm just explaining holy
26:37
spirit okay he's my best friend he's
26:39
quite a character and uh but if i was
26:42
gonna say that if i travel travel travel
26:44
and i've got so much going on here right
26:46
here where i'm at you know when your
26:48
studio is in your home it's one thing
26:49
but when your offices are in your home
26:52
you really like it work all the time and
26:55
since i'm up all the time it's never
26:56
ending stuff that i have to do plan uh
26:59
draw
27:00
a
27:01
schedule a revelation to write down
27:05
it's like it's it's never ending and i'm
27:07
okay with that but sometimes i get
27:09
really tired every now and then i'll
27:10
just say that myself though the rest of
27:12
the lord upon you man i'm out and i'll
27:14
sleep like 14 hours
27:16
[Laughter]
27:18
that's awesome it is not just to say it
27:20
is actually a thing a thing that you can
27:23
ask for and declare over and just get
27:25
ready to be in a place where you're
27:26
going to go to sleep
27:28
[Laughter]
27:30
okay so i know paul was asking this
27:32
behind the scenes earlier uh for you
27:35
know can you have her explain that so
27:37
that's going to help a lot of people so
27:39
just declare that over yourself before
27:40
you sleep right just to clear it
27:42
obviously not while you're driving
27:44
[Laughter]
27:46
while you're in your bed ready
27:49
no not while you're on a plane they may
27:50
have to wake you up or carry you out
27:54
be wise with your declarations yes be
27:57
wise
27:58
okay whatsoever you say that's one of
28:00
those things you'll have what's whoever
28:02
you say so
28:04
laura wants to know can you ask cat if
28:07
the movies that artists make in heaven
28:10
have any influence on filmmakers here on
28:14
earth
28:17
i think um
28:19
i don't quite know how to answer that um
28:24
there are people and i know you're
28:26
probably not talking about this but when
28:27
people who do that for a living they
28:30
make it to heaven yay
28:32
that's what they'll be doing in heaven
28:33
it's their gift and they have all
28:37
types of new
28:39
um
28:40
material and understanding and
28:42
revelation uh for making the movies in
28:45
heaven but the whole uh plan of god
28:49
is to tell stories that's what jesus did
28:52
when he was on the earth he told stories
28:53
all the time
28:54
the father still does it in the throne
28:56
room they love that they love to tell
28:59
stories of visional things and have
29:01
things uh you know explanation to see
29:03
images or share things
29:05
and uh god is definitely for movies and
29:08
heaven they don't have to have ratings
29:09
allow that because when people think
29:11
well depending on what they go and see
29:14
i hope you're not seeing the other kind
29:15
of stuff
29:16
what goes in your soul what you watch
29:18
with your eyes is going to go in your
29:20
soul and some things you don't ever want
29:22
to let in your soul but the movies in
29:24
heaven are intense exciting they're
29:26
funny
29:28
they're beautiful
29:30
and i do have to say this there are
29:32
images set on purpose from heaven
29:35
down into the mind of scriptwriters
29:38
screenwriters producers
29:40
uh i don't know how many people say i
29:42
have this great idea for a movie you
29:44
know i hope one day somebody makes a
29:46
movie about this i i hear that almost
29:48
all the time
29:49
i am writing scripts myself
29:52
and
29:53
which is going to be pretty powerful now
29:54
that's the commission to do that but yes
29:56
there are things in heaven that happen
29:59
the way they do things things that are
30:01
are living there or architecture that's
30:03
there it definitely is on purpose
30:06
dropped down into the mind
30:08
of people who are creative on the earth
30:10
so that they can produce those things
30:12
like that whether it by doing those
30:14
images or words they put with those
30:16
images is is kind of up to what's in the
30:18
soul of the person making the movies but
30:22
the movie the home movie industry is
30:24
definitely has available to them
30:26
revelation being sent on purpose so that
30:29
people will know different things even
30:32
some of the things you see in some of
30:33
the sci-fi movies
30:35
like star wars and other things i
30:37
literally see
30:38
some of the way things happen or images
30:41
i've seen literally
30:42
in heaven i see them in some of the star
30:45
wars movies it's really really powerful
30:47
when that happens
30:49
wow that must be so cool for you you're
30:51
probably like oh that's from heaven like
30:53
i could imagine watching it oh that's
30:55
what happened
30:57
jen hears it all the time we're usually
30:58
the ones who go check out movies you
31:00
know if they're like g maybe pg i don't
31:03
think we see much anything beyond that
31:06
uh all of our movies most all of our
31:08
movies will be g or pg but there won't
31:10
be anything
31:11
no i'll just give you heavens uh code
31:14
for raiding in movies uh if a movie is a
31:17
g on the earth the the angels in heaven
31:20
will say well it's it's good most of the
31:22
way or if it's pg s is partly good some
31:26
of the time pg-13 it's only good 13 of
31:30
the time
31:41
i heard you also say one time when you
31:43
do go into a movie um that's
31:47
wrong or bad or
31:49
violent or that the demonic realm i mean
31:52
they
31:54
vomit
31:55
on your head as you walk into the
31:57
theater is that that
31:59
shocked me but my spirit resonated that
32:02
at such truth
32:04
well they mark you
32:06
they have to have a way to mark you
32:08
two reasons number one so they can
32:10
pursue dragging you into deeper stuff
32:13
okay because you can't wash these marks
32:14
off unless it's something you repent for
32:18
i would encourage people do not see
32:20
anything that's got graphic violence
32:23
profanity
32:24
sexuality
32:26
or witchcraft which crafts a big one a
32:28
lot of people like that type of thing
32:30
now there's a big difference in safe
32:32
fantasy
32:34
like you know um
32:36
i know the narnia movies are really
32:37
powerful
32:39
especially the first three
32:41
you can tell i've been talking a lot
32:43
that's okay
32:45
but it's very important that you
32:47
understand
32:48
that what you enter into
32:51
this is how holy spirit says they're so
32:53
simple in heaven when they explain
32:54
something whatever you enter into will
32:56
enter into you
32:57
now i'm not saying that you'll get
32:59
possessed by things but things will
33:01
attach themselves to you or follow you
33:05
i need my hot chocolate jen
33:08
i didn't get to have my hot chocolate
33:09
yet people that's like my coffee
33:12
and um so anyway um being a seer that
33:15
was one of the first things i noticed uh
33:17
when i started going to movies i go down
33:20
the hallway well i never go into any of
33:22
the bad ones and usually you can check
33:23
them out online to see what's actually
33:25
in the movie
33:27
and uh they've been really not good in
33:29
this last year maybe the last two years
33:32
but especially the last year even some
33:34
of the things on television even in the
33:36
commercials they've stuck in a lot of
33:38
things that are indecent
33:40
or uh or outright witchcraft stuff and
33:43
i'm talking about just regular tv and
33:45
the commercials you got to make sure you
33:46
know what's going on and what's coming
33:47
on your screen
33:49
but i walked in and i saw these ledges
33:52
and i see both sides all the time i see
33:55
the dark and i see the the operations of
33:57
the host of the angelic
33:59
and of the darkness and they had demons
34:02
sitting on a ledge it's a spiritual
34:04
ledge you're not going to go into
34:05
theater and see unless you're a seer and
34:07
they were waiting and whoever went in
34:09
that r-rated movie got vomited on
34:14
it's like a green slime when they came
34:16
out it was still on there walking down
34:17
the hallway still down there so no
34:19
matter what you think you're doing and
34:20
nobody knows somebody knows the whole
34:23
spirit realm knows that you've gone into
34:25
something that you shouldn't have seen
34:27
with your eyes
34:28
or heard or uh or
34:30
listened the actions that are going on
34:32
in that thing there's a reason why they
34:34
make it restricted is what they say r is
34:37
for remember heaven says it's rotten and
34:39
so i will sometimes walk in to the
34:42
theater as i'm going to my theater
34:45
probably at the end
34:47
you know the decent fun movie i like
34:49
funny movies a decent one and um
34:52
and i'll see these things i'll walk up
34:54
i'll get almost next to them i'll go
34:58
i evict you in jesus name
35:01
and they almost vomit on themselves
35:03
because
35:05
they don't know i can see them unless i
35:07
say something
35:09
and just like well i had a question
35:11
asked is satan know everything you think
35:13
no he knows what thoughts he puts in you
35:16
and he knows that you received it by the
35:17
response you give to the thoughts he's
35:20
given you but he's not omnipresent he's
35:22
not omniscient on this and he doesn't
35:24
know everything all at the same time
35:25
which is another reason why they mark
35:27
you
35:28
if you do something that's sinful or
35:30
against god they mark you because then
35:33
uh they know who to pursue because satan
35:35
doesn't know everything and then he'll
35:37
send or assign sometimes them to you to
35:40
get you uh to go into deeper areas of
35:43
darkness and so if you've done things
35:45
like that make sure your pencils wiped
35:47
off
35:49
hello people they have a whole system in
35:51
the spirit realm that we don't have here
35:54
and because you can't see
35:56
and you think that god's okay with it
35:58
because he said hasn't said anything to
35:59
you no he lives by his own word you know
36:03
what's right what's wrong if you just
36:05
read the word of god and usually inside
36:08
your spirit man if it has a red flag
36:10
about something then don't be a part of
36:12
it don't just go with your friends
36:14
because they want to go see a seance or
36:15
they want to go see something
36:17
like that whole thing they had happened
36:19
that was like made up to satan that big
36:21
event they had recently
36:23
and i think people died in there and
36:26
nobody should go into anything like that
36:28
i think this is just a fun thing around
36:31
you know the fake holiday halloween uh
36:33
around that time they have a lot of
36:35
these things that people think well this
36:36
is special this is different
36:38
that is not a fantasy okay evil
36:41
wicked spiritual stuff is not a fantasy
36:44
it is a reality and you want to be
36:46
careful what you enter into you don't
36:48
want to take things home with you or
36:50
even be in your home
36:53
this is the reality of the spirit realm
36:55
however when you're out doing things for
36:57
god you help people you love people
37:00
god also writes your name in the book he
37:02
don't necessarily put a mark on you but
37:04
he put your name in the book they helped
37:05
this person this day they gave this
37:07
money to the homeless person they helped
37:08
them find a place to stay they were kind
37:10
to this person whose heart was broken uh
37:13
he he makes a book of remembrance that
37:15
he will then bless you from
37:17
so either side
37:19
somehow is making notes okay
37:23
and all of that just from that one
37:24
question about the movie theater but
37:26
that's true anywhere i go i see hell's
37:28
activity everywhere uh las vegas is one
37:32
of the worst places and he had me go
37:34
there i went there and spoke and i'm
37:36
telling you what
37:38
one day one day that will be a region of
37:40
light god's taken las vegas not because
37:43
he wants it because he marked it for
37:45
himself a long time ago
37:47
places that are marked by god for his
37:49
purpose as the enemy on purpose
37:51
wants to try to defile them one day it
37:54
will be called the city of his son
37:57
las vegas will not be called the city of
37:59
sin because the city of his son
38:02
and that while i was there i had a lot
38:03
of encounters but i saw the demonic
38:06
following people into places where they
38:08
shouldn't be going and i would just tell
38:10
you if they try to hand you a pack on
38:12
the street corner las vegas don't take
38:14
it don't take it it usually has an x on
38:17
it you don't want that thing because
38:18
evil spirits go with every packet that
38:20
was given one went with that person who
38:22
took that packet
38:23
wow that's so powerful your life goes on
38:27
in this world you think this is all
38:28
there is and you're wrong this is all
38:30
temporary what you're seeing with your
38:32
natural eyes is temporary the unseen
38:35
realm is what made the the same things
38:38
okay
38:39
god made them it says all that you see
38:41
was made by the unseen realm in the
38:43
unseen realm are both sides until the
38:45
day everything is ended and all the evil
38:48
wickedness is put away into the lake of
38:51
fire which will happen a long way down
38:53
the road so don't look for that to
38:55
happen but until then you keep your
38:57
guard up it says guard your heart that's
38:59
your soul for out of it will be the way
39:01
you live your life is the truest
39:03
scripture in the bible except for being
39:05
born again
39:06
and so yeah my life is not different i
39:09
go to the mall i see all this activity
39:11
from both sides going on
39:13
and uh i have learned to train my eyes
39:16
to stay where god wants them unless he
39:18
wants me to go up and say something to
39:19
somebody which sometimes he does have me
39:21
say something
39:23
and i love the holy spirit because the
39:25
holy spirit's not scared to go into the
39:28
dark places no he's not and he's not
39:31
scared to bring the light of christ into
39:34
the places we would say oh that's you
39:36
know i i love that about him because he
39:39
he's not held back by anything he he
39:43
will go and reach the lost where he
39:44
needs to go and infiltrate yeah and all
39:47
that you just shared has i know opened i
39:50
i feel it in the spirit that a lot of
39:52
people are
39:53
they're feeling they're repenting for
39:55
things they've they've seen or done but
39:57
this is the truth this truth needs to
39:59
get out because it's going to help you
40:01
progress with your walk with god get
40:02
closer to the heart of god yeah the
40:05
whole point of the enemy the enemy satan
40:07
he is our number one enemy of satan
40:09
because he's really in charge of the
40:12
wrongs being done now
40:14
uh
40:14
he can't create anything good
40:17
there's nothing good that comes out from
40:19
from hell or from the devil and the ones
40:21
trying to control our country they are
40:23
actually cannot control good they can't
40:27
they cannot create anything good because
40:29
it isn't in them okay that's why we're
40:32
trying to let you know don't go further
40:33
or chase the darkness because you'll end
40:35
up by getting gray on the inside of you
40:37
if you looked at you i would see gray
40:39
light
40:40
okay get it out evict it from your soul
40:43
just repent for things you probably
40:44
shouldn't have said or gone to or read
40:47
but you're right about the holy spirit
40:49
he is a bold and he's about to touch all
40:52
flesh in this earth and boy is that
40:54
going to be something that's going to
40:55
happen when that goes on but no
40:57
sometimes you let me walk up to somebody
40:59
you know and i don't like the fact that
41:00
people think every tattooed pierced
41:02
person is wicked that's not true either
41:04
some have markings from god god assigned
41:06
them to have that done that might not be
41:08
the norm but you can't put everybody in
41:10
a box you just can't do that and we are
41:13
to love everybody no matter who they are
41:15
if nothing else i will send the life of
41:17
god into buildings that i know are
41:19
filled with things that they're doing
41:20
wrong i'll send the fire of god the love
41:23
of god to bring freedom uh to the people
41:25
who are there there are people praying
41:27
for those people and your prayers are
41:29
powerful because holy spirit can go the
41:31
angelic can go even it's not somewhere
41:34
where you'd normally see somebody like
41:35
sharing the truth or something like that
41:37
i send it into all of those places i
41:40
pray for the souls of the people either
41:42
doing those acts or or or you know
41:44
bringing them so people can be a part of
41:46
them i'm always careful to make sure
41:49
that there is hope for people's souls
41:53
amen beautiful and i'm going to skip to
41:55
a question because someone asked about
41:58
um
41:59
about being marked let me find that
42:02
question
42:03
um okay so
42:05
um
42:06
teresa asked or tressa asked in
42:09
ephesians 1 13 it says you were marked
42:12
in him with a seal
42:14
is this a literal seal that we can see
42:17
in heaven and do you do you want me to
42:19
read ephesians 1 13 and 14
42:22
um
42:23
which which which translation is it yeah
42:26
let me let me read i think i'm reading
42:28
out of um new king james
42:30
in him you also trusted after you heard
42:33
the word of truth the gospel of your
42:36
salvation in whom also having believed
42:39
you were sealed with the holy spirit of
42:42
promise who is the guarantee of our
42:44
inheritance until the redemption of the
42:47
purchased possession to the praise of
42:49
his glory so she's asking it says there
42:53
you are marked in him with the seal is
42:55
that a literal seal that we can see in
42:58
heaven
42:59
i um that mark has to do with the holy
43:03
spirit
43:04
um
43:06
when you're born again of course once
43:07
you're born again you then have the
43:09
promise of the holy spirit coming no one
43:12
can keep him from you it really is
43:14
talking more about the holy spirit at
43:16
that point
43:17
that's why christ sent him and he even
43:19
said
43:20
jesus said i have to go but i will send
43:23
the one who comes after me uh you know
43:26
and the holy spirit does so many things
43:28
for us i'm glad you even you that you
43:29
brought him up but the holy spirit will
43:31
begin to pursue people especially who
43:34
have that seal it's a seal of his blood
43:37
that's what that seal is when you get to
43:39
heaven is something you literally can
43:40
see
43:41
when you are born again is one of the
43:43
most powerful things in the spirit that
43:45
ever happens on this earth many things
43:47
happen in heaven when you're receiving
43:49
christ uh the father comes and takes the
43:52
stone of fire from himself and places it
43:54
in your spirit and then your spirit man
43:56
has light on the inside uh jesus gives
43:59
you a deposit of the anointing he walks
44:01
in that's first john 2 27 if you want
44:03
the scripture
44:04
many things happen that you're not aware
44:06
of and most pastors don't even know
44:08
these things are happening they do know
44:10
your name is written in the lamb's book
44:12
of life and that that seals you for
44:14
eternity
44:15
uh another promises given to you is
44:18
eternal life um everybody everybody it
44:21
will live forever it depends on you
44:23
choose where you're going to live you're
44:24
going to live in uh you know in heaven
44:26
now and then on the new earth with the
44:28
lord or will you live forever with the
44:30
enemy in eventually the lake of fire but
44:34
that seal is two things
44:36
it is a seal with the promise of the
44:38
holy spirit coming to come and abide in
44:41
you which now is available to you before
44:43
it wasn't you cannot have holy spirit
44:46
dwell in an unclean person so what that
44:49
mainly was talking about was you the
44:51
seal the promise of the holy spirit now
44:54
being allowed to enter into you and what
44:57
he does is when you get born again holy
45:00
spirit will come alongside you
45:03
he will come immediately and come
45:05
alongside you the bible talks about that
45:07
but when you and ask and invite him to
45:10
indwell you
45:12
there's an opening made from that seal
45:15
the holy spirit knows it and understands
45:17
it and he can enter into you so this is
45:20
a lot of deep stuff for some people but
45:22
they do they do have marks there's two
45:25
other marks you get too
45:27
one is the name
45:30
the name of your god in the palm of your
45:32
hand
45:33
and the name of the city of your god in
45:35
your forehead and for all those who
45:37
understand about end time stuff you know
45:40
that in the last days when the
45:42
antichrist is on the earth that's
45:43
several hundred years from now people uh
45:45
certainly look he's not on the earth
45:47
right now but when he comes uh he will
45:50
want to mark people with a mark in the
45:52
palm of their hand and in their forehead
45:54
and that is why
45:56
he knows that god does that it's like
45:58
mocking god so you are marked with those
46:01
visible marks and in heaven you can see
46:03
these visible marks it's it's really
46:05
it's it's written not in a known
46:07
language but you'll get a mark right
46:09
here that's the name of your god okay
46:11
that's jesus christ and up here is the
46:14
name of the city of your god that those
46:16
are marks so you are marked in in those
46:19
ways but the seal of the promise is for
46:22
holy spirit then
46:24
having permission to come alongside you
46:27
when you're born again and then the most
46:29
important thing you'll do besides
46:30
getting born again is invite the holy
46:32
spirit to indwell you and then he goes
46:34
from here to living in you and i know
46:37
holy spirit is an unlimited layered
46:40
being which is why he's everywhere all
46:42
at the same time but you don't get a
46:44
little part of him you get a whole of
46:46
him living in you and then your life
46:49
really begins to change i hope that
46:52
helped
46:52
hallelujah and that answer is
46:55
cassandra's question too because she
46:57
asked is there anything similar to
46:59
tattoos in heaven
47:04
what is is there anything similar to
47:07
tattoos in heaven
47:10
yeah there are and i want you to know
47:12
people that god was the first one to
47:14
mark
47:15
uh satan steals everything we actually
47:18
have not that i'm selling but i'm
47:20
letting you know one of those powerful
47:22
revelations on the cd
47:25
uh is called copycat
47:27
and it shares everything in the
47:30
scriptures and things that's on heaven
47:32
that satan when he came to the earth
47:34
wants to defile it and take it for
47:36
himself
47:37
marking doesn't actually belong to satan
47:40
it belongs to god he marked you know um
47:43
remember he marked cain in the garden
47:45
remember that he put a mark on him
47:47
people would see so they wouldn't kill
47:49
him he's going to mark 144 000 uh jews
47:52
uh in the last days a mark you visibly
47:55
can see
47:56
um there are other times in the bible or
47:58
talked about people god putting a mark
48:00
on them uh that's god god marx that's
48:04
his part of his m.o
48:06
and satan to insult him
48:09
would get people to put satan would get
48:11
people to put his marks on them and so
48:14
there's i've seen people with both like
48:17
they used to have the one kind but they
48:18
got born again and they had marks of god
48:21
i happen to know that my own daughter
48:23
god told her to put um
48:27
she has lightning bolts on her
48:30
he told her put brass knuckles on her
48:32
feet and i don't mean little ones i mean
48:34
brass knuckles because she dances for
48:37
him it's his gift and god said you wore
48:40
in the spirit when you dance therefore
48:42
you will have
48:43
these uh brass knuckles on your feet
48:46
that's from god that was something god
48:48
requested of her she didn't even
48:49
hesitate to do it she told me after she
48:52
did it and as she's telling me the holy
48:54
spirit said that was that was a command
48:56
from god for her to do that to represent
48:59
what she is for him
49:01
i know other people who god has said i
49:03
want these marks of my marks
49:05
representing me put on you and that's
49:07
going to begin to increase and i will
49:09
say this if you're not if you're not an
49:11
adult yet make sure you let your parents
49:14
know or discuss it with your parents in
49:16
many way until you be commented an adult
49:19
and make sure you're hearing the right
49:21
thing but there are many powerful things
49:23
lightning bolts belong to god the fire
49:25
all belongs to god and we know that um
49:29
one of the images of course that
49:30
represents hell is skulls
49:32
people go well that's your that's your
49:34
skeleton yeah but most people don't put
49:36
it on them because it represents it's
49:37
supposed to represent death and we know
49:40
that god says this day i let you choose
49:42
choose life or death
49:45
you if you have decided if you are an
49:47
adult and you want to put a mark on you
49:49
i would make sure it's something that
49:51
portrays the image of god
49:53
and not hell okay
49:56
and if you can get them changed i will
49:58
say this there's going to be a move of
49:59
god one day on this earth that will
50:02
actually erase many of the wicked
50:04
tattoos this is for believers
50:07
many of the wicked tattoos put on them
50:09
that they had put on them in in one of
50:11
these moves of god coming that will be
50:13
wiped off of them
50:15
i've heard testimonies of ministers
50:17
praying for people
50:19
with tattoos that they had before they
50:21
were born again with gang affiliation
50:23
and stuff and the lord removed it
50:25
supernaturally yes
50:27
that is
50:29
that's what you're talking about that's
50:30
amazing that's right supernaturally just
50:33
gone you know praise god
50:35
don't have to go through the pain that's
50:37
right you don't have to go through the
50:38
pain amen
50:40
um kel ass in proverbs 8 um calls wisdom
50:46
a she
50:47
and her
50:48
what does this mean is wisdom a woman
50:51
and i'm just going to read proverbs um 8
50:54
1-3 out of new living translation
50:57
listen as wisdom calls out
51:00
here as understanding raises her voice
51:03
on the hilltop along the road she takes
51:06
her stand at the crossroads by the gates
51:09
at the entrance to the town on the road
51:12
leading in she cries out loud so kel
51:15
wants to know um
51:16
is wisdom a woman
51:19
um it's not it's not a woman you
51:22
wouldn't call uh any an angel a male or
51:25
female you wouldn't call them that they
51:27
have the appearance of them but a spirit
51:31
is not man or woman okay so i know she
51:34
didn't understand this i'll let you know
51:36
yes it looks like a female it is
51:39
feminine appearance in every single way
51:41
her voice
51:43
uh she is a spiritual being is the
51:45
proper way to say that she is a
51:47
spiritual being in heaven uh and of
51:50
course she's sent down here to the earth
51:51
sometimes to bring wisdom to people
51:54
um it is always a good thing to ask for
51:56
sound wisdom if you want to ask god for
51:58
something
52:00
there's many things you can ask him for
52:01
you know like extreme discernment don't
52:03
do that unless you're ready to have
52:04
things revealed
52:06
but sound wisdom is a good thing but
52:08
wisdom is a feminine spirit she looks
52:12
beautiful and i've seen her in heaven
52:14
i've seen her on the earth and i don't
52:17
know why some people think everything
52:19
has to look like a male
52:21
if the father can be both okay the
52:24
father can be uh
52:26
and
52:27
have um
52:28
you know what that's why god said let's
52:30
make man in our image right let's make
52:33
man in our image and after our likeness
52:35
is how they operate and then he said and
52:37
we will make them male and female and
52:40
there's a reason why he made them male
52:42
and female so that we would when
52:44
whenever we would be married we would
52:45
have a way to have be connected together
52:48
we would create soul ties together but
52:50
there are many feminine spiritual beings
52:53
in heaven and i want to go back to the
52:55
seven tortures you talked about
52:58
uh those flames those torches are seven
53:00
spiritual beings
53:03
they serve the father i've seen them um
53:06
the flames never go out but they'll step
53:08
out of that there's seven spiritual
53:10
beings that serve the father himself uh
53:13
they they belong to him
53:15
and uh and always have belonged to him
53:17
so things are represented in different
53:19
images in heaven but those seven flames
53:22
of those churches before the throne are
53:24
seven spiritual beings that serve the
53:26
father
53:27
continually the same thing is spirit the
53:31
wisdom is a feminine spirit
53:33
she can go in and out of the father to
53:35
get directions from him or instructions
53:37
from him or even impartations that she
53:40
brings to the earth sometimes and will
53:41
walk through somebody and leave it
53:43
inside that person
53:45
so
53:46
we need desperately in the body of
53:48
christ to have spirit around boot camp
53:52
we need a greater understanding of what
53:53
the spirit realm is and how that
53:55
operates why did god make it well it
53:58
always has existed actually that's where
54:00
he's always existed in but but there are
54:02
spiritual beings that look feminine
54:04
heaven there's some that take care of
54:06
the forest the streams i've seen them
54:09
they're very beautiful looking they have
54:11
beautiful song when they sing in places
54:14
in heaven
54:15
so some of the seraphim
54:18
they live in the glory cloud over the
54:20
throne they some of them look feminine
54:22
some look masculine i mean you know
54:24
their their faces and whatever but they
54:26
have hair that looks like looks like
54:28
it's on fire and they'll dip down out of
54:31
the glory cloud over the throne and they
54:33
get more of the glory on them then they
54:35
go back up they never stop singing over
54:37
him
54:38
so yeah spirit uh the spirit of wisdom
54:41
is a spiritual being and she does look
54:45
feminine
54:46
that's that's amazing thank you for that
54:48
revelation even about the seven spirits
54:50
of god that's that's awesome
54:53
don asks cat has said that the hosts
54:55
have their own language does their
54:58
language sound tribal almost like native
55:01
american languages
55:04
um i wouldn't say it sounds tribal it's
55:07
uh
55:08
if they're talking to each other i don't
55:09
necessarily understand but of course
55:11
they can they speak in english to me
55:13
when they speak they use the language
55:15
that i understand and know
55:17
um
55:18
i would say the tribe part is right uh
55:21
they got that down and
55:23
the native american tribes were not the
55:26
first tribes okay
55:28
the jewish tribes
55:30
were around that's why they made tribes
55:32
that's why the father made tribes right
55:34
the 12 tribes of israel remember that
55:37
that's because in heaven when he made
55:39
the the host and when he made the angels
55:42
they were made in tribes
55:44
like there's a whole like the royal
55:46
guard let's use them this very very
55:48
extremely high level of dominion
55:50
authority and power
55:52
are the royal guard they all look like
55:54
lions that doesn't mean they walk on all
55:56
fours
55:57
their faces look very similar to lions
56:01
is just what he decided to choose them
56:03
but there's tribes there's tribes of the
56:05
royal guard and they all look very
56:08
similar i mean you can identify them in
56:10
heaven you know they're from this tribe
56:11
of the host or this tribe of
56:14
their scouts those are tribes um
56:16
there's um i'm trying to think of some
56:18
of the other ones but there they have a
56:20
title like a title of the tribe they're
56:23
a part of that is what they're sent for
56:25
that's what they were designed for
56:27
some are couriers there's a on the
56:29
angelic side that's under gabriel
56:31
there's there's couriers there's scribes
56:34
there's worker angels there's ones who
56:36
deal in the body parts in the warehouse
56:38
all those are tribes created for gabriel
56:41
but the host is the army most of them
56:43
look like creatures but there's a whole
56:45
tribes of them so there's not just like
56:47
one of this one or one of that one
56:48
they're all individual ones they all
56:50
have personalities
56:52
uh so the tribe thing that part is right
56:56
but the the language that the host the
56:58
the host of heaven which are the armies
57:00
of heaven they understand the commands
57:02
they're the ones who take the commands
57:04
to go in war on our behalf
57:06
even did that and for israel back in the
57:09
ancient days uh as said in isaiah that
57:12
the captain of the host that would be
57:14
michael
57:15
went to the far ends of heaven and
57:18
gathered the army to fight on behalf of
57:20
israel
57:21
and i can tell you this i do know that
57:23
michael's headquarters in heaven is at
57:25
the the bottom it's a world because the
57:29
that's why the earth is round i'm always
57:31
going to say that the earth is not flat
57:33
heaven is not flat it's a world called
57:36
the father's house and at the top part
57:38
of this world is where the throne
57:40
excuse me the throne room is and all
57:42
that that stuff going on but at the
57:44
bottom part hidden in clouds of glory
57:46
dark glory a dark glory doesn't mean
57:49
it's black people it's if you took a
57:51
million peacock feathers because in
57:53
these clouds of glory that that will
57:57
will wrap around all of michael's
57:59
headquarters are millions of eyes those
58:02
are living eyes and they're even in
58:03
these clouds of glory that that will
58:06
cover and and protect because
58:08
heaven's army headquarters is not a
58:11
tourist attraction in heaven i keep
58:13
saying that you're invited to go there
58:16
in the throne room you don't have to be
58:17
invited but at heaven's at michael's
58:19
place you're going to have to be invited
58:21
to get to see that place and so god even
58:23
has diagrammed and laid out heaven
58:25
itself that world called heaven to have
58:28
specific things specific tribes of the
58:31
host or the angelic being involved with
58:33
it
58:34
he does have a way he plans things god
58:37
has a memo a mode of operations and he's
58:40
very uh specific and perfected in all
58:43
those ways
58:45
that's beautiful
58:47
and it's really amazing how he said
58:48
about all the eyes because the first
58:50
thing i thought of was the wheel within
58:52
the wheel
58:53
yeah and the the cherubim with all the
58:56
eyes so we see that in scripture about
58:58
about what you just said
59:01
and let's see i think this will be um
59:03
the last question
59:05
for today we're already an hour i can't
59:07
believe it um
59:08
so margaret asks do we have a new name
59:12
in heaven if so does everyone get the
59:15
memo about our new name
59:20
when you go to heaven this is when you
59:23
go to move there i don't i well i have i
59:26
have a little nickname the father gives
59:27
me i won't give that to anybody
59:29
but the father loves to name things he
59:33
loves even places in heaven have names
59:35
that he's given to them
59:37
uh that new name will be like a little
59:40
nickname which is something only he
59:42
calls you and only you and he will know
59:44
it and it actually says in the bible
59:46
that he'll write on a stone it says that
59:48
in the bible that's not a river rock
59:51
it is a white diamond and he will write
59:54
that name and he will give it to you and
59:56
you and he will know that name it's not
59:58
going to be something that's going to be
60:00
passed on have you not going to run tell
60:01
your friend oh this is my name the
60:02
father gave this
60:04
it isn't like that um
60:06
your own friends will probably call you
60:07
the same nickname they did on the earth
60:08
by the way well unless it wasn't nice
60:10
and they'll pick a new one
60:12
but the new name you get in heaven is
60:15
something special that the father
60:17
chooses to call you and yes he is going
60:19
to personally give you that that white
60:21
diamond that stone
60:23
whenever it says stone in heaven is
60:25
talking about gemstones he will write
60:27
that on there and give it to you and
60:28
that's probably what he will call you uh
60:31
whenever you come to meet with his per
60:32
him personally or something
60:34
and uh yeah he likes to personalize
60:37
everything so you will get a new name
60:39
it won't be some big o drawn out name
60:42
that you can't remember or understand
60:44
it'd be something precious from the love
60:46
of god to your heart that's what it will
60:48
be
60:50

going on by
65:17
what everyone else is saying on the left
65:19
are those who don't know anything at all
65:20
pray for those people
65:22
but this is a time of excitement
65:25
in heaven there's such an excitement
65:27
coming from there every time i go now
65:29
there's so much excitement in the air of
65:31
things that are about to happen and and
65:33
just flow over this earth it's not the
65:36
rapture okay i know people say i'm wrong
65:39
but guess what there's they said that 10
65:40
years ago 20 years ago and and i don't
65:43
argue about who's right or wrong i know
65:44
god has a timetable in heaven he has his
65:47
own uh
65:49
timeline and we're not even anywhere
65:51
near close to the very end
65:54
he expects all the things he promised
65:56
his son that we would walk in before the
65:59
end comes the world will know us as
66:02
believers
66:03
because of our love for each other
66:05

66:24
around you

66:28
presence of all the enemies around us
66:31
and bless you abundantly do people think
66:34

01:44

01:46
something weird well okay i'll just say
01:48
this happy wednesday february 2 2022.
01:51
uh it's nice to be back as i have to be
01:53
back and alive
01:55
uh minus uh 10 pounds since you all saw
01:58
me last i got knocked down on the back
02:00
side and uh i'm just coming back but i
02:03
appreciate you all i know thousands of
02:05
you've been praying and sending notes
02:07
and we i really really appreciate that
02:10
drea and i both got this thing bad
02:12
um
02:13
i suppose it was the variant that people
02:15
talk about
02:17
because you know i never lost my sense
02:18
of taste or smell like some people talk
02:20
about so anyway thanks for supporting me
02:24
and
02:24
supporting the show and supporting
02:26
kelsey kelsey did a superb job kelsey
02:30
so i i do have an issue with talking
02:33
um
02:34
sometimes the coughing thing will just
02:36
decide to kick in there and so jeff is
02:38
ready that if for any reason something
02:40
happens and i can't
02:42
uh i can't stop the coughing then i'll
02:44
just call for him and say jeff you go
02:46
ahead and pick it up from here and then
02:48
he'll keep asking questions okay
02:50
so um i think with just to minimize
02:54
talking i think without further ado
02:55
let's bring in cat here
02:59
hello everybody
03:01
good to see you
03:02
cat it's good to see you thank you
03:06
steve and uh we're still playing energy
03:09
life strength wholeness in jesus name
03:11
right now we're not towering that attack
03:14
on your body we command the whole
03:16
servant again to pull down every spirit
03:17
of infirmity make that thing like dust
03:20
in jesus name
03:21
and the life of god to you this day yeah
03:24
oh i received that i totally received it
03:26
well cat well i'm as i told you before
03:28
the show i'm going to keep my questions
03:31
short so that i don't talk as much and
03:33
you
03:33
and um but let's jump right in uh well
03:36
let's before we jump into the questions
03:39
uh anything you want to say because
03:40
things have happened in the news since
03:42
you and i were
03:43
last on together anything you'd like to
03:45
say about current events a lot of things
03:48
have happened i'm very excited about the
03:51
convoys um yeah that
03:54
in both in canada and you know the one
03:56
here in america
03:58
it's showing this land
04:00
that we the free people
04:02
are not putting up with any more junk
04:05
garbage control or deception
04:07
i think it's probably the worst days the
04:10
left are the liberals no matter where
04:11
they're from canada or here i think it's
04:13
probably the worst days they've had so
04:15
far since this whole thing started
04:17
because even this late in the game it is
04:20
a game satan thinks he's playing but let
04:22
me tell you god is moving those
04:25
those things across the board and i can
04:27
tell you what i knew eventually that the
04:30
people would get fed up
04:32
and make a stand and that's what's
04:34
happening and that that should get you
04:36
so excited everyone out there should be
04:37
so excited that it's the people making
04:40
the stand
04:41
yes i know god's going to come in he is
04:43
going to do something amazing and
04:45
magnificent but how wonderful that
04:48
they're seeing that these people think
04:49
they've got us in controlling us they're
04:51
realizing they don't have us at all
04:54
and so i really want to uh thank thank
04:57
god right now for protection for those
04:59
convoys god i know that you have a
05:01
purpose in them thank you for all the
05:03
supply they need while they're out there
05:04
thank you for covering all of us because
05:07
they're carrying the supply for us but
05:09
they need to be supplied right now you
05:11
are with prayer
05:12
with protection
05:14
uh just with the life of god in all
05:16
those trucks
05:18
no accidents hold-ups delays or
05:20
breakdowns or attacks of any kind that's
05:22
what i'm declaring in jesus name so yes
05:24
it's making a stand like never before i
05:27
don't think this has happened in
05:28
probably years in this country i know
05:31
probably never in canada have the people
05:34
ever stood up like they are right now
05:35
saying we aren't taking this we're not
05:38
putting up with it they're believing god
05:40
that they'll even have a replacement in
05:42
the leadership there and i tell you they
05:44
will get it they will get what they're
05:46
asking for they're doing what's right
05:49
right now and so i'm fully supporting
05:52
the convoy that's going in canada i
05:54
think it's going from british columbia
05:56
all the way over to i can't remember i
05:58
think quebec i think it's where it's
05:59
headed uh but there's all kinds of
06:02
things this is the stuff about um the
06:04
wonderful thing about this is
06:06
no news media can keep people from
06:08
finding out what's happening because
06:10
everybody's sharing you everywhere
06:12
whether in canada or here um at home
06:15
if you didn't know it yes there's a
06:17
convoy
06:18
if they haven't left already it'll be
06:20
going from california all the way across
06:22
to dc
06:24
how about that put it in their face that
06:27
they're not going to tolerate this stuff
06:28
anymore that is a sure sign that that
06:31
foundation the evil has been standing on
06:33
is crumbling to nothing i'm quite sure a
06:36
lot of them are making different choices
06:38
like where can i run to or where can i
06:40
hide they're coming after us that's
06:42
probably what they think so i just want
06:44
you know i'm celebrating over this whole
06:46
thing but keep them in prayer and their
06:48
family members you know that god will
06:51
cover all of them and i'm just really
06:53
grateful and excited and i had told
06:55
people the very last of this last year
06:58
watched the first quarter of this year
07:02
2022 it's a powerful year but in 2022
07:06
more exposure and more patriotism and
07:09
the people standing up will happen than
07:11
this happened in all this time since
07:13
this whole thing started so this is a
07:15
sure sign that movement
07:18
towards righteousness justice and
07:19
freedom it's already started
07:22
yeah it's been so
07:24
gratifying i wish i hadn't been so sick
07:27
to enjoy those convoys more but you know
07:30
now i'm at the tail end of this thing
07:32
and it's such a gratifying thing to see
07:35
truckers i think there's like 50 000 or
07:38
maybe more than that trucks
07:40
and i mean the last time we talked about
07:42
convoys was back in the day when people
07:44
had see cb radios and ev there was a
07:47
song about
07:48
convoys and all that and that's all and
07:50
it was more of a fun thing you know uh
07:54
but now this is like deadly serious fun
07:57
but it is fun
07:58
i'm serious but let me tell you some of
08:00
the a couple things um
08:02
a couple things
08:04
every overpass that they have to drive
08:07
under these trucks in this whole journey
08:10
people have lined these overpasses so
08:12
that the truckers will see them and
08:14
they'll stand there even in the freezing
08:16
cold where it's cold uh they're bundled
08:18
up they've got signs they've got bull
08:20
horns they are cheering them on uh for
08:23
the freedom that they're they're helping
08:24
to take back for all of us
08:27
so even the truckers are being inspired
08:29
people are setting up camps wherever
08:32
these truckers stop and they've got food
08:34
prepared for them they've got things
08:36
that they need you know something if
08:38
they re
08:39
replacements wherever they need in their
08:40
in their vehicles or stuff done to them
08:43
and this is being done free out of love
08:46
for the stand that uh they're making
08:48
together is something the people coming
08:50
together which is one of the things
08:52
we've been praying all along so the
08:55
there's not it is the truckers but it's
08:57
also all these other people thousands of
08:59
them being involved as they go through
09:01
every state or every county or whatever
09:04
even in canada that the same thing is
09:06
happening and i do know this some
09:08
americans went up into canada to help
09:11
with this whole the canadian uh convoy
09:14
too and there's thousands of trucks
09:15
there but i'm pretty certain there's
09:17
over 50 000 right now
09:19
uh and and the the american ones i don't
09:22
even know where they're gonna they get
09:23
enough to join them they may line the
09:25
thing without even having to drive
09:27
anywhere because more and more people
09:29
are getting excited about it so yeah so
09:31
they're being having food hot food
09:33
prepared for them uh drinks to take with
09:36
them coffee and stuff like that coffee
09:37
stops
09:38
and so uh it is really a wonderful thing
09:41
you know and trudeau up there in canada
09:45
the the latest rumors are he supposedly
09:48
got the uh virus
09:51
to watch this coughing here um
09:54
but
09:56
it's also rumored that he didn't have
09:57
the virus at all he just went and hid
09:59
out because
10:00
he said they know we're coming for it
10:02
well we're not going to come for them
10:04
violence-wise i hope uh but they know
10:07
what we're coming for
10:10
we're coming for them but we're just not
10:12
going to hurt them but yeah i don't mind
10:14
if they
10:15
lock them up i really don't mind if they
10:18
lock them up what did they think what
10:20
did all these elites
10:22
not just in canada but australia
10:25
the us what did they think we were going
10:27
to do when they tried to take our
10:29
freedom away from us you know what did
10:31
they think this was going to turn out
10:33
like
10:36
i was i know it's supposed to not be
10:38
violent violent not liking the natural
10:40
uh violence right but the very number of
10:43
the people coming is so shocking
10:46
because you know so many have remained
10:48
silent they just remain silent and put
10:50
up with stuff that is going on but you
10:53
reach a limit if you're a free person in
10:55
free country there's just so much you're
10:57
gonna take
10:58
especially here in america we are
11:00
america the land is the free the brave
11:03
and the bold
11:05
and we know that this country is our
11:07
country we the people have this country
11:10
and a god lets us decide on things so
11:13
just because they decide they're going
11:14
to be a dictatorship it's not going to
11:16
last very long and i think that part has
11:18
ended as far as the people are concerned
11:21
and i think they're so shocked that the
11:24
number you know they've heard a few from
11:26
it they've tried to hide everybody
11:27
they've done their best to blot out our
11:29
voices or stop things from being heard
11:31
but you can't stop the action you cannot
11:34
stop you know fifty thousand trucks is
11:37
probably two or three uh people in each
11:39
truck
11:40
and all the people coming along to help
11:42
provide for them that is a massive site
11:45
and there's no way on god's earth can
11:48
these people hide that which is the most
11:49
terrifying thing they can't stop it they
11:53
can't do anything about it so they don't
11:55
know they don't know what's going to
11:56
happen which is the best part the people
11:58
who who are being they're they're being
12:00
shown that we're not putting up with
12:01
this anymore the leftist the liberals
12:04
they don't know what's going to happen
12:05
they just know something is started
12:07
that's not going to stop towards taking
12:09
our freedom i think that's the best part
12:12
yeah
12:13
so
12:14
where are they coming for
12:17
well let's see if you're ready to jump
12:18
into some other questions
12:20
um i'm going to try and keep them short
12:22
just because of this cuff so
12:24
you ready for the first one oh i'm ready
12:27
all right so and i think we've talked
12:29
about this one time months ago but the
12:32
question the viewers are asking is what
12:34
does god think about cremation is it
12:36
okay
12:40
i was just let me tell you first of all
12:43
the what the holy spirit told me when
12:45
the first time i was caught up to heaven
12:47
this was his statement please tell them
12:49
it's okay if they cremate uh they can
12:52
still put the ashes back together and
12:55
it's a lot cheaper and that's actually
12:57
what he said to tell people it's a lot
12:59
cheaper
13:00
you know what the ashes are even if you
13:02
sprinkle them somewhere
13:04
but i have to they're using that script
13:06
in the bible that says
13:08
i think it's in leviticus do not allow
13:10
yourself to be passed to the fire and
13:12
they make that one scripture
13:14
the whole law about no cremation
13:18
and yet back in the day most people uh
13:22
leaving all religious religion out or
13:24
whatever you want christianity out of
13:25
the whole scene
13:27
the way that one number one way that
13:29
they would dispose of the bodies was to
13:30
burn them because
13:32
number one they didn't know they don't
13:34
it was harder to dig in the ground
13:35
especially over if you've ever been in
13:37
the over in the mid east and places like
13:39
that it is not easy to dig anything in
13:42
that dirt there's so much stone and
13:44
stuff so a lot of them were
13:46
automatically going to be cremated with
13:48
just the number one way of choice um
13:51
just for um you know to keep things not
13:53
having dead bodies laying around and
13:55
things like that
13:56
make it sound like that but it was the
13:58
easiest and the safest way
14:01
to dispose of the bodies was that they
14:03
were cremated god does not care and let
14:07
me tell you people think well if i'm
14:08
cremated i won't have a body to be
14:10
resurrected
14:12
if he made you out of nothing and this
14:15
is the truth if he made you and
14:17
everything around you with nothing
14:20
he can totally get your body back
14:22
together every molecule every part of it
14:25
he knows what it is and i want to say
14:27
this if you think you're you're hurting
14:29
yourself by being cremated that god
14:31
doesn't want you to have a body you know
14:33
to bring back
14:34
what about the ones who were eaten by
14:36
sharks they were killed in an explosion
14:38
they were killed in a fire they're
14:40
they're you know they're pretty much
14:41
ashes and god wants you to know he can
14:44
put you back together this is not a a
14:47
spiritual ritual not like you know and
14:50
the side of the darkness it's not about
14:52
that back in the day in leviticus that
14:55
was a book of laws that's when a lot of
14:57
the laws were made because at that point
15:00
in mankind they needed them
15:02
some of them were doing something very
15:03
uh
15:04
not not good things wicked things evil
15:06
things and so that's why there was laws
15:09
laid down to follow and that that that
15:12
one made do not allow yourself to be
15:14
passed through the fire is not even
15:16
talking about cremation
15:18
whenever something like that comes up
15:19
especially in the
15:21
leviticus or one of those books that
15:24
talk about the ancient days you have to
15:26
look at the culture of the day
15:29
and what was going on
15:31
uh when they said don't like the best of
15:33
fire people literally were taking their
15:35
arms and burning them they were putting
15:37
on all fruits to burn them even parts of
15:40
them or family members i don't want to
15:43
add that but this is how bad it was back
15:45
in that day and so god was going to stop
15:48
all that he wanted that stopped you
15:49
can't give people his burnt offerings
15:51
they were doing that and so that was why
15:54
that was made you're not allowed to have
15:55
to pass through the fire was literally
15:57
don't take parts of you and burn it on
15:59
the altar to some wicked god
16:02
that's what they were doing so that was
16:03
made for that purpose it had nothing to
16:05
do with you cannot be cremated
16:08
and so he actually when he sent me back
16:10
from heaven the first time tell
16:11
everybody it's okay to be cremated is
16:14
cheaper and it really is
16:16
thousands and thousands of dollars
16:19
less to be cremated if you want to put
16:21
them in a jar or something like that
16:23
excuse me find something nice i've
16:26
been talking a lot
16:30
if you want to find something nice to to
16:32
put their ashes in that's perfectly fine
16:35
if you want to put them in a niche you
16:37
know at a cemetery or something that's
16:38
also okay if you want to spread them on
16:40
the river if that was their decision to
16:42
do that he knows where every one of
16:44
those ashes are and you'll be able to
16:46
put them back together but really
16:48
realistically
16:49
i know since we we have sent my one
16:51
brother on to glory
16:53
it was like forty thousand dollars uh
16:56
forty to eighty thousand dollars to have
16:58
a standard funeral
17:00
that included the casket and the burial
17:03
and all of that was very expensive
17:06
we had my brother cremated like we did
17:08
the rest of our family members and then
17:10
you know uh it's okay you know we we
17:13
know where they are they're in their
17:15
jars they're in their little things
17:16
treasure chest whatever
17:18
um but it's okay with god to do that
17:21
because i think it was like i don't know
17:23
you can i think you can get cremation
17:24
done for like a thousand dollars
17:26
sometimes less depending on where you
17:28
where you take that body to be done
17:30
most funeral homes do perform cremations
17:33
and you can actually still have a
17:34
ceremony with a picture of them there
17:37
maybe the the beautiful urn or whatever
17:39
you have them put in and
17:42
to me it was still just a sign of
17:44
release and releasing them into heaven i
17:46
planned this whole service it was a
17:48
joyful one we actually celebrated we ate
17:51
and we sang and it was a beautiful thing
17:54
to send somebody off to heaven but
17:56
please don't let people's opinions or
17:59
their misinterpretation of the
18:01
scriptures keep you from not having to
18:04
spend tens of thousands of dollars i've
18:07
actually had people call crying saying i
18:09
should have had them buried the proper
18:11
way we could only afford cremation i
18:13
went then you did the right thing and
18:15
they're okay with that in heaven by the
18:17
way your family members are okay with
18:19
that
18:20
that's awesome that's awesome though
18:22
that's gonna encourage a lot of people
18:23
can't so all right
18:25
this next question we talked about just
18:27
before you came on the air
18:29
um
18:32
there's so much i could say but the
18:33
bottom line is there's this thing going
18:35
around about the flat earth
18:37
talk
18:38
talk to the people about this thing
18:41
and what what does god put on your heart
18:43
to say about all these people believing
18:45
in a flat earth
18:48
first of all talk a little bit about
18:49
what they think it is what they think it
18:51
is not what it is okay
18:53
right someone had in their head it
18:56
always starts with a thought in
18:58
somebody's head a man's head not gods
19:01
okay obviously
19:03
uh so what they do when they think well
19:05
i really for some reason i believe and
19:08
some of them can use ancient maps from
19:10
when people cross the ocean and they
19:13
actually would draw at that time they
19:15
drew it flat they didn't normally they
19:17
have no conception of how to draw like a
19:20
curved earth and show a map with the
19:22
water and the travel um
19:25
uh the travel route of where they were
19:27
going to go so it made sense to draw
19:30
just a flat thing and then show the
19:33
shipping ship going across and a lot of
19:35
the charts were made like that way back
19:37
then some are even still made that way
19:39
it's just out of convenience
19:42
but whenever these thoughts come usually
19:45
it's the enemy and i have to tell you
19:47
the enemy sometimes doesn't just give
19:49
wicked thoughts he gives stupid ones
19:53
because yeah if he can't get you to go
19:56
into sin if he can't get you to fall
19:59
apart and just you know dissolve and
20:01
give up your whole life then he will get
20:03
you distracted
20:06
and some of the biggest distractions
20:08
going on in the earth right now are some
20:09
of the most ridiculous things
20:12
and but this flat earth thing they
20:14
consider it a thing it's a society which
20:17
means it's a group of people who've
20:19
dedicated themselves to prove the earth
20:21
is flat millions of dollars have been
20:24
wasted on that
20:26
and i know you'll say what about nasa
20:28
what about all that stuff i'll address
20:30
that in a minute
20:32
but they will come back to you i know
20:33
people who got out of it and i mean
20:35
literally got out of it they had to call
20:37
sam they had to call and say i'm no
20:39
longer part of this take me off of the
20:41
roll don't count me in anymore i'm not
20:43
throwing my money away because they had
20:45
revelation from god the earth is round
20:48
okay a world is round okay
20:53
and
20:53
the earth is a shadow and a type of
20:56
heaven so the earth in the planets are
20:59
styled after heaven itself heaven is a
21:02
world
21:03
and i know i laugh about all this
21:05
because a lot of people when they draw
21:06
heaven they draw a flat place up in the
21:08
sky with a few clouds thrown in for free
21:12
maybe a rainbow dazzling across the
21:14
clouds it isn't any of that it is a
21:17
literal world it says in the book of
21:19
john or jesus said in my father's house
21:21
are many mansions
21:23
that house is not a building it's not a
21:27
square thing which shutters on and a
21:29
roof it is a whole world
21:31
it would take the world to put heaven
21:33
because heaven is bigger than our entire
21:35
galaxy system
21:37
and uh and there's a lot going on there
21:39
there's real life there in your
21:40
spiritual body but the flat earth thing
21:43
back to the flat earth society i have to
21:46
throw this in for free um before the
21:48
flat earth thing came up
21:50
probably somebody who believed in the
21:52
middle earth decided to make it a flat
21:54
earth because they could never prove
21:56
there was a middle earth there was a
21:58
whole middle earth society probably
22:00
maybe 50 years ago or before that a
22:02
little bit that they believed because
22:04
the bible talked about descending
22:07
and they talked about abraham's bosom or
22:09
paradise
22:11
which is in the center of the earth that
22:13
is a spiritual abode and in paradise or
22:17
abraham's bosom was where all the
22:18
righteous who were counted as righteous
22:20
by god like moses abraham isaac you know
22:23
uh before jesus christ died on the cross
22:27
and shed his blood
22:28
other than elijah and enoch
22:31
who the father took up to heaven himself
22:34
still in their natural bodies
22:35
nobody ascended into heaven when they
22:38
died before jesus came and paid a price
22:40
to give us a way back to the father they
22:43
descended into this gloriously beautiful
22:45
place which i have seen
22:47
called abraham's bosom and it says that
22:49
in the bible it also calls it paradise
22:52
and i have proved when jesus was on the
22:54
cross with the two thieves the one of
22:56
them was just bashing him you know they
22:58
were laughing making mocking him but the
23:00
other thief said don't don't do anything
23:02
and he's done nothing wrong and so he
23:04
turns his head towards jesus says
23:06
remember me when you come into your
23:08
kingdom
23:09
in other words he was repenting he said
23:10
i'm a sinner you know i i deserve this
23:13
but but you don't talking to jesus so
23:16
remember me when you come into your
23:17
kingdom so he was saying i have sinned i
23:20
repented the sins i receive you as my
23:23
lord and savior on the cross
23:25
by the way without getting baptized in
23:26
water or baptism in the holy spirit so
23:28
you people out there demanding everybody
23:31
have all these things done traditions
23:32
done and there's nothing wrong with them
23:34
but you must repent of your sins
23:37
and believe on jesus christ as your
23:39
savior that's how you get to heaven so
23:40
jesus turns
23:42
his head to the stephen says to him
23:45
today
23:46
you shall be with me in paradise
23:49
well
23:50
obviously the cross is not paradise
23:52
israel's not paradise what was he
23:54
talking about jesus himself was going to
23:57
descend into paradise which was higher
24:00
up than where hell was you can actually
24:02
see
24:02
from a part of paradise you can see a
24:04
little bit of the gates of hell which
24:06
would be
24:07
a little bit further down but a big wolf
24:11
was between paradise and hell and nobody
24:14
could cross over by the way it wasn't
24:16
something you could do in your spiritual
24:18
body you couldn't go from one place to
24:20
the other and so people began to look
24:22
for paradise and there was a whole group
24:25
unfortunately started here in florida
24:28
there were the mid middle earth people
24:31
middle earth society
24:32
and they said if they walked along the
24:34
beach far enough it was a downward thing
24:36
they would then enter into the middle
24:38
earth well we know that's a joke just
24:40
like the flat earth society is a joke
24:43
and i think because they could never
24:44
find middle earth they decided to call
24:47
it a flat earth
24:48
and therefore they began to search the
24:50
scriptures to find what things they
24:52
could make to find to prove the earth
24:54
was flat and they came up with two
24:56
different ones which don't mean at all
24:59
what they say they mean
25:02
number one if you don't have revelation
25:04
from the father part of the word is
25:06
talking about the spirit realm it isn't
25:09
always talking about this natural realm
25:12
there's a scripture that talks about the
25:14
four corners of the earth and that is
25:16
one of the main ones they these in this
25:19
flatter society see there's corners that
25:22
means it has to be flat it can't be
25:24
round
25:25
and the first time i heard that i was
25:27
like i was in shock i laughed out loud i
25:29
went you do realize that scripture is
25:32
talking about the north south east and
25:35
west
25:36
those are directions that has nothing to
25:38
do with the earth is flat whatsoever and
25:41
and then there's another one that talks
25:43
about the columns there's columns or
25:45
pillars that are holding up under the
25:47
earth and so they say look it's flat
25:50
it's sitting on a table like thing
25:51
there's a structure with legs on it and
25:53
what do you not realize that those two
25:56
pillars are angels that are talked about
25:59
in the book of genesis where when their
26:01
time comes they're thousands of feet
26:03
tall
26:04
if you ever
26:05
the spiri spirit realm you see
26:07
uh that they're there they're waiting
26:10
waiting for what well it talks about in
26:12
the bible in the last days when one
26:14
angel will put one foot in the middle of
26:17
the ocean
26:18
and in the middle of the land it says it
26:20
very clearly and that's what one of
26:22
those columns or pillars are sometimes
26:24
those are angels
26:26
and having been passed and out above the
26:28
earth i can see the two angels standing
26:31
there but i do need to give you a
26:33
scripture that says jesus sits above the
26:37
circle of the earth so let all of the
26:40
flat earth be flushed down the toilet
26:42
where it becomes
26:43
because this is a world made by the
26:46
hands of god handmade by him for the
26:48
purpose of sending us from himself that
26:52
we would come into this natural realm
26:54
and have a physical body that we would
26:56
keep with us through all eternity so
26:58
basically that's it
27:01
but these people who have nothing better
27:03
to do obviously with their money or
27:04
their life go looking for people who are
27:07
hoping there's some other thing out
27:09
there that they can prove exist
27:11
and they have people pour millions of
27:14
dollars into this flat earth society it
27:17
just used to be the flat earth theory i
27:19
guess when a bunch of people men got
27:21
together and decided it was so important
27:22
they'd actually name it a society so
27:24
it'd have a name uh there literally are
27:26
people some even well-known people uh or
27:30
rich people who have become a part of
27:32
this thing they could be made to feel
27:34
special they're contributing to what
27:35
they call is truth it's nothing but a
27:38
distraction from satan
27:40
these people should be winning the loss
27:41
giving to the poor helping to build
27:43
things or promote the kingdom
27:45
or jesus christ himself by the way jesus
27:48
laughs when they say that i just have to
27:50
tell you every time in heaven they hear
27:52
someone talking about their their
27:53
meetings they have meetings usually not
27:56
announced meetings trust me they they
27:58
don't want the the general public to
28:00
know they'd be coming and laughing at
28:01
them but jesus laughs every time they
28:03
hear the earth is really flat
28:06
because you know the word made
28:08
everything jesus made this earth he
28:09
knows it's round it has a core a very
28:12
core in it and it goes outward to the
28:14
land it talks about the different levels
28:16
of the earth uh that god made that he
28:18
made and then he made the sky around it
28:21
that's the first heavens then there's a
28:23
second heaven which is just a higher a
28:24
part of god the third heaven
28:26
is where the throne room is is where
28:28
heaven itself the world called heaven
28:30
you can't see with your natural eyes
28:32
because it's a spiritual world but there
28:34
is absolutely no flat earth and i have
28:37
to use this to explain just because i
28:39
like to okay let's say here's the flat
28:41
earth right and there's pilots going
28:44
around this letter so i guess when they
28:47
get to the edge they just flip it all
28:51
over to the other side of the flat earth
28:54
to get where they're going
28:56
so uh i mean there are some things that
28:58
are so ridiculous for people just to
29:00
waste their time on so uh but the earth
29:02
is round it is a world he sits above the
29:05
circle of this earth and then there's
29:07
another one that says the earth is
29:08
footstool i think some of them like to
29:10
say there's another proof see it's flat
29:12
with a cushion on top of it
29:14
they keep changing the shape of this
29:17
flat earth it's almost hilarious yeah
29:19
except that this sucks time and the life
29:22
of people away which they could be doing
29:24
better things well yeah i appreciate you
29:27
doing that you know plus i i'm
29:29
while you're talking i'm thinking i seem
29:31
to remember that people that were sharp
29:34
shooters like for the military they even
29:36
have to
29:38
use their scopes and use their settings
29:41
on their rifles to to take into
29:43
consideration the curvature of the earth
29:46
where they won't be accurate and then of
29:48
course you have pilots who who have to
29:51
take in the curvature of the earth
29:53
and all of their navigation they got a
29:55
guide that's a full-time navigator if
29:57
it's a bitcoin you know
29:59
and yeah it's crazy what people will
30:01
waste their time on but that way well
30:03
one one more thing to throw in with all
30:05
that because i mentioned it is nasa the
30:08
national aeronautics space
30:09
administration
30:11
um we know what the all the stuff they
30:14
put forward to just to have discoveries
30:17
and any of you who don't realize all
30:19
those missions we've sent into space or
30:22
around the earth
30:23
have produced so many products you're
30:26
using right now systems ways to create
30:29
things do things they have ways to test
30:31
things that can't be tested anywhere
30:33
else so this whole thing about exploring
30:36
was something god put in us we want to
30:38
know what's there what's out there
30:40
they see the round earth all the time
30:43
and they have to plan your right their
30:45
trajectories
30:47
have to be planned taking in the
30:48
curvature of not just part of the earth
30:50
but the whole earth
30:52
uh also they're planned how long will
30:54
they be out there how long will it take
30:55
to go around the earth if they're going
30:57
to go from there to the moon
30:58
um
30:59
and the flat earth people say they're
31:02
lying
31:06
they made it all up just to prove try to
31:10
prove the earth is round and not flat
31:12
it's like i guess when you get stuck in
31:14
a ditch you're really in the ditch and
31:16
can't get out i think some of them need
31:18
help to get out of that ditch but the
31:20
earth is not flat it is beautifully
31:22
round heaven is a beautifully round
31:25
sphere it's a sphere it is not a flat
31:28
anything okay so don't worry about
31:30
falling off the edge you're okay
31:34
that's good
31:35
all right let's see um
31:38
uh okay here's
31:40
pardon me i don't know how to pronounce
31:42
her name i've been i've been a
31:44
hairstylist
31:46
i've been a hair stylist since i was 19.
31:48
i'm very good at it and really enjoy it
31:50
will i be able to do hair in heaven
31:55
well that is a wonderful wonderful
31:57
question and the answer is actually yes
31:59
but heaven is on another whole level in
32:02
every way
32:03
the highest tech is in heaven it's not
32:06
on the earth and the only reason people
32:08
have more technology here or greater
32:10
technology or levels of it is because
32:13
those ideas come from heaven itself into
32:16
the mind of man now those are great
32:17
ideas okay god's ideas produce good
32:20
satans produce stupid or distractions
32:22
that's what they do
32:24
so those ideas come from god but yes um
32:28
one reason why you'll be able to do that
32:30
when god made all of us when he made us
32:33
and carried us inside of himself he put
32:36
in you a gift
32:38
it says every good and perfect gift
32:40
comes down from the father of lights
32:42
well when we lived in the father we were
32:44
little spirits we were our spiritual
32:46
body and we had light because we lived
32:48
inside of him
32:50
and uh so we were weren't just like
32:52
little floaty things so we had a little
32:54
spiritual body and we played inside of
32:56
him
32:57
and uh and then and we had light on the
32:59
inside of us
33:00
but each one of us were made special
33:03
because of what he put in the passion to
33:06
do something or be something
33:08
well i can tell you if you can look at
33:10
my hair i did not do this a salon
33:13
operator who's highly skilled makes my
33:16
hair look wonderful all the time and yes
33:19
that is her gift and she loves to do it
33:21
and she does it well athletes who are
33:24
gifted are better than the ones who are
33:26
just trained and have talent there's a
33:28
difference in having a talent and being
33:31
trained in something than being that
33:33
gift and we know there's all kind of
33:35
shows they want the most talented the
33:38
most gifted uh they're all over
33:41
the tv and on the internet
33:43
and you know when that person has a gift
33:46
the way they sing captivates you it just
33:49
carries you places it's amazing artist
33:53
there's a big difference in an artist
33:55
and you can just kind of make something
33:57
or you make something that people go wow
33:59
that is amazing
34:00
that's the person's gift
34:03
and all kinds of people have gifts maybe
34:05
not just to art or singing or even dance
34:09
like ballet yes they have ballet that
34:11
you don't wear choo-choos and stuff in
34:12
heaven but you do get to use the gift
34:14
that you are gardeners have a gift there
34:17
are gardens that go from miles in heaven
34:20
the most beautiful flowers but the
34:22
flowers sing and change colors in heaven
34:25
so you can imagine being a gardener
34:27
tending things like that
34:29
uh people who create beautiful things to
34:31
wear in heaven they still they still do
34:34
that in heaven now you have to
34:35
understand in heaven there's nothing
34:37
that's defiling
34:39
revealing
34:41
nothing that would be seductive in any
34:43
way in your clothing but it's beautiful
34:45
amazing it always feels good it looks
34:48
good and there's all different styles of
34:50
clothing that you can have in heaven
34:52
because you know why those people have a
34:54
gift
34:55
even rodeos are in heaven why that is a
34:57
gift people like the spectacular the
34:59
exciting the adventurous awesome
35:02
all of these are gifts and or or cooking
35:06
wow you know uh cooking is called an art
35:08
in heaven
35:10
really really
35:11
baking yes they have bakeries why
35:13
because those bakers had a gift on earth
35:16
if they never got to use it on earth
35:18
when they get to heaven they'll have a
35:20
whole bakery and everything they need to
35:21
create delicious amazing things that
35:24
they offer to everybody for free but
35:27
that's why i know there are salons by
35:28
the way i was actually taking the one
35:31
and they have all kinds of i don't know
35:33
gizmos and things to use but they use
35:36
light to color your hair there's no
35:38
chemicals there's no heat applied
35:40
nothing like that
35:41
and yes you can have your hair any color
35:43
you want in heaven sometimes they apply
35:45
diamond dust emerald dust
35:47
um and then you go in the throat into
35:49
the throne room and the glory of god
35:51
reflects off of all the gemstones you're
35:54
wearing or if it's in your hair it's not
35:56
about making yourself be better than
35:58
anybody there's no pride in heaven
36:01
but the fun in advent
36:03
even training pets that's a gift let me
36:06
tell you i know people who can and who
36:07
cannot do it uh don't take your pet to
36:10
be trained by somebody who doesn't know
36:11
what they're doing
36:12
you probably won't like them when they
36:13
get back
36:14
but every kind of thing you know that
36:16
goes on around you
36:18
uh so there are architects in heaven
36:20
there's designers there's event planners
36:23
people have events all the time in
36:24
heaven and there's some who do it to
36:26
perfection and i can tell you when it's
36:28
a gift it's like breathing you do it so
36:31
easily
36:33
they actually have event planners like
36:36
like in a sense here you would hire them
36:40
but there you wouldn't hire them but
36:42
they'd agree to
36:43
plan something right yes you schedule
36:46
them to come and do an event for you in
36:48
heaven maybe on your property you want
36:50
to do something and there's everything
36:52
amazing available no matter what type of
36:55
event you want to have
36:58
many people's mansions are big enough to
37:00
hold hundreds of people their grounds
37:02
are so massive they can hold thousands
37:04
tens of thousands of people if they
37:06
wanted to
37:07
and and then there's places in heaven
37:09
you could go to the valley of the falls
37:12
or a passionate paradise you could go to
37:14
the surf park and you don't have to pay
37:16
to rent anything you use these beautiful
37:19
places you just let that let them let
37:21
them there are people who are in charge
37:22
of that describes who who book your
37:24
events for you and then you advertise by
37:27
standing in the middle of your grounds
37:29
and saying hello everybody i'm going to
37:31
have this beautiful event it's going to
37:33
be held at this place just show up
37:36
whenever you can get there and they
37:38
don't have days and weeks but they
37:39
usually will announce that right at the
37:42
time when it's ready they've done all
37:43
the preparations it's all ready to go
37:45
they'll announce and say just come when
37:46
you when you're ready because we're
37:48
going we're starting right now
37:50
and so oh yeah it could be any kind of
37:53
event fun events adventures uh hiking
37:56
events in the mountain of spices um it's
37:59
just it's just it's almost un
38:02
unbelievable the beautiful things they
38:05
have the exciting fun things but if
38:07
you're an event planner can you imagine
38:09
planning an event and the mountain of
38:12
spices where the trees talk wow where
38:14
the leaves it looks like fall all the
38:16
time but the leaves are huge and there's
38:19
purple and there's reds and these
38:20
yellows and golds and there's beautiful
38:22
places to hold events up there in the
38:24
mountain spices you can go backpacking
38:26
trail riding um while the horses are
38:28
talking to you that you're riding on
38:30
talking about where you're going
38:32
you can do photo shoots yes they have
38:34
cameras not made like ours and the
38:36
unlimited mega pixels for all your
38:38
photographers
38:40
i love those mega pixels
38:42
heaven is a glorious
38:44
exciting
38:45
amazing place and with all of that
38:48
you get the presence of jesus christ the
38:51
father and holy spirit and when it can't
38:54
even number the angels that are in
38:56
heaven they're everywhere some of them
38:57
take care of the forest
38:59
they take care of the flowers they take
39:02
care of the waterfalls
39:04
um but it's a beautiful place so yes if
39:06
you're an event planter you got it made
39:08
when you get to heaven make sure you
39:09
know jesus christ
39:11
are there are there some people that
39:13
have how you said that some are so big
39:15
that you can put hundreds of people in
39:17
someone asked you what's the largest
39:19
house or
39:21
examples of some of the largest houses
39:24
you've seen in heaven homes houses would
39:27
um and and if someone has a massive
39:30
mansion and someone has
39:32
a less than mentioned as far as size
39:35
um would they would they say can i use
39:38
your mansion to hold my event because
39:40
it'll hold hundreds of something like
39:42
that does that kind of thing happen i
39:43
think that is probably quite correct
39:45
because everybody in heaven wants to
39:47
serve one another
39:48
uh you know it says to be the greatest
39:50
of all you be the servant of all
39:51
everybody wants to serve
39:54
not just prove that they're greater it's
39:56
the love it's the love it's the care
39:59
that's there nobody's left out and oh
40:01
i'm sure they would be pleased for you
40:04
to come home in their mansion the
40:05
biggest mansion i ever was shown in
40:07
heaven belonged to an intercessor
40:11
really
40:12
the mansion
40:14
was the size of new york city
40:19
and that's because the intercession
40:22
uh receive it caused that many rewards
40:25
to come to this person
40:27
through because of their intercession is
40:29
that the is that kind of the point
40:31
yes this person had prayed in four moves
40:34
of god had prayed for people who hated
40:36
them who pray they would pray and
40:39
intercede um in such great authority
40:42
because they made it a lifestyle and i
40:45
know you're all probably picturing
40:47
they're on their knees you know with a
40:48
little altar in a closed dark room doing
40:51
nothing but praying you know their life
40:53
away it wasn't like that they lived a
40:55
life of prayer no matter where they were
40:58
they interceded all the time by speaking
41:01
and declaring
41:02
knowing that god would do these things
41:04
because they they'd known them from a
41:05
child but that was their reward and
41:08
nobody nobody was upset that they had
41:10
this reward because you know these
41:12
people paid a price with their life the
41:14
other place i've seen with some of the
41:16
biggest mansions would be the martyrs
41:18
the martyr side of heaven there's a
41:20
whole area that's for the martyrs who
41:22
really gave your life they were
41:24
fantastic
41:26
places that i saw there
41:28
um wow did the people um
41:31
the the this is the first time i
41:33
realized that they're all in one place
41:35
i've never heard that before
41:37
or
41:39
when you say they're all in one place is
41:40
that
41:41
literally if you died a martyr
41:44
are you
41:45
are you headed towards that place or how
41:48
was it that god
41:49
chose
41:50
maybe can you give any more detail on
41:52
that
41:53
like i'm a martyr suddenly i died as a
41:56
martyr i was killed during the course of
41:59
serving the lord and
42:01
um do i am i automatically going to
42:04
martyr heaven for lack of a better word
42:07
it's just a whole area where they're
42:09
they're highly honored there people go
42:11
there just to see
42:13
uh they know most of the people you
42:15
learn about people when you get to
42:16
heaven if you didn't know much about
42:18
them you will learn a lot about people's
42:20
lives
42:20
and the price they paid and what they
42:22
gave
42:23
sometimes um being a martyr means you
42:26
it's not just like taking a bullet for
42:28
somebody it's not just that
42:30
it's that you lay down your life it
42:32
talks about lengthy on your life for
42:34
others laying down your life for others
42:35
that
42:36
because you care about them so maybe you
42:39
you maybe you are taking on the brunt of
42:41
something or or not necessarily a burden
42:44
but a challenge that they would have had
42:46
to take or would have had to do but but
42:48
they didn't and you gave your life for
42:50
doing that let's say mother teresa for
42:52
example yes she's in heaven people why
42:55
wouldn't she be she gave her an entire
42:57
existence just to love people and help
42:59
see them healed and
43:01
she wasn't afraid to touch the sick or
43:03
the lame i mean they came to her uh she
43:05
poured herself and poured god into
43:07
people
43:08
uh that there'd be an area in it's just
43:11
called they we know it's not called
43:13
martyrs heaven people just know the
43:15
people who gave their life literally
43:16
gave their life were they have places
43:19
there
43:21
beautiful mansions like everyone has a
43:23
mansion they have a gorgeous mansion but
43:25
the grounds around that whole mansion
43:27
would be very significant fantastic and
43:29
amazing because of them giving their
43:32
whole self for somebody for somebody for
43:34
jesus christ and uh and everybody wants
43:37
to go just to see
43:39
now you still would have an area that
43:41
would be yours near your families and he
43:44
said to go to prepare a place he doesn't
43:46
say you have to have one mansion by the
43:48
way and he actually said that to me
43:50
because on the grounds of this mansion
43:52
in the martyrs area in this martyr's
43:55
beautiful area there are doors
43:58
on that mansion property when they step
44:00
through that door they would be into the
44:02
by the mansion that's near all of their
44:04
family
44:06
and they would walk through the door on
44:07
that property come back to the other one
44:10
the one that god gives them like part of
44:12
the reward it's like instead of having a
44:14
beautiful medallion or stuff like that
44:16
giving them this
44:18
and people want to go see your reward
44:20
and so that's why that is that's why
44:22
that's been established there and i'm
44:23
not the only one who's seen it there's
44:25
other people who've talked about the
44:27
martyr part of heaven i i remember years
44:30
and years ago rick joyner told of the
44:32
experience of going to heaven
44:34
he said some of the greatest
44:37
monuments i'll use the word that i think
44:39
he probably used but
44:40
uh uh to another person
44:44
were when he would see these massive
44:47
monuments
44:48
uh to praying mothers i mean a specific
44:51
woman let's say my mother's name is
44:53
frida let's say she was an intercessor
44:55
she's she's still with us right now but
44:59
you know
45:00
if she's a praying mother i don't know
45:02
how much of a prayer praying mother she
45:04
was but
45:06
if she was then that would be they would
45:08
be a massive
45:10
um
45:11
memorial uh or something
45:15
memorial was the writer memorial was the
45:17
right one
45:18
okay i actually was taken to two
45:21
people's memorials and shown them uh one
45:23
was dan crouches
45:25
really really i saw a memorial i saw
45:28
while it was still being built in heaven
45:30
she hadn't passed yet and i saw it and
45:32
it was the most it was so beautiful it
45:34
was an area and there was this beautiful
45:37
fountain that's why i said a memorial
45:39
it's a whole park and it's and it's
45:41
dedicated to jan's love for the children
45:44
of the world this is actually says that
45:46
on this uh and in gratefulness to jan's
45:49
love for the children of the world
45:50
because you know she did a lot for kids
45:52
all over the world and gave herself for
45:54
that
45:55
and and there's this beautiful memorial
45:57
fountain but there's a whole park that
46:00
people can go in and do things
46:01
especially kids and i don't know if
46:03
you've heard me talk about the platform
46:05
where kids go stand on a platform and a
46:06
big bubble is formed around they float
46:08
around heaven with their friends and all
46:10
these bubbles well that's where i saw it
46:12
was at jan's memorial wow
46:14
it's a fun place kids in heaven can go
46:17
and have a fun time but there's other
46:19
things to do in this hope it's a park
46:21
but the memorial actually itself is this
46:24
massive fountain i i couldn't even tell
46:26
you the square footage of it or the
46:27
height of it but around the sides
46:30
is like a child's face or figure from
46:33
every nation around the world and when
46:36
you walk past that part of the fountain
46:38
it comes alive
46:40
like the sculpture that sculpted into
46:42
this mountain the child comes alive and
46:45
it laughs it looks at you it's like
46:48
living hearties
46:50
and i walked all around the sun
46:53
captivated i mean i saw children like
46:55
from africa
46:56
from india from uh from all the
46:59
different places in the world where she
47:01
would have food and gifts taken to them
47:03
she did it her whole life
47:05
and this walks her memorial it's got her
47:07
name on it so and sometimes we would
47:10
think of a monument it's just like an
47:12
obelisk kind of a concrete thing right
47:14
it's so much more than that uh some of
47:17
them have parts of that included in
47:19
there maybe things they did that would
47:21
represent i've seen uh i went into
47:23
another one where you went into this
47:26
building and you you watched things it
47:29
wasn't just like a a movie theater was
47:31
great greater beyond that you walk past
47:33
these things they've been created that
47:34
was scenes from their life
47:37
and you would actually watch them when
47:39
they rescue people help people pray for
47:41
them
47:42
brought themselves you would see what
47:44
they did it was recorded but it was like
47:47
real life
47:49
it was on my flat screen and i explained
47:51
it was like no more than 3d dimension
47:54
you literally were watching like you
47:55
were there
47:57
seeing what they did then you would step
47:59
up and you would go to another one it
48:00
was fantastic
48:02
uh then another one um i saw that was uh
48:06
like a pool this beautiful pool it went
48:08
for forever and there was a crystal
48:11
bridge and you'd walk across this
48:13
critical crystal bridge and in this
48:15
beautiful lake were like round open
48:17
portals and it was sort of the same
48:19
thing that you would look down in these
48:21
pools of
48:23
the portals i called them parts but the
48:25
pools and from this crystal bridge you
48:27
could see all the different acts of
48:29
kindness
48:30
or liberty liberating people maybe
48:32
people in the military who liberated
48:35
areas and things that they had talking
48:36
about the plans and the things they did
48:39
now there's no death or destruction
48:40
shown in any things but you're not going
48:43
to miss
48:44
knowing what these people did with their
48:46
lives on the earth
48:49
yeah that's you and and
48:51
cat how long does that go on
48:54
i know there's no time in heaven
48:57
but if if eternity is
48:59
eternity
49:01
are people going by these memorials for
49:03
all eternity
49:06
having seen i mean eventually you've
49:08
walked by every memorial in heaven so i
49:10
mean
49:12
i think it would take a really
49:15
really long time
49:18
to to see uh some people have their
49:20
favorite ones and sometimes they go
49:22
there with the person
49:24
whose memorial it is oh okay
49:27
yeah they'll take you and go oh it's a
49:29
whole different thing when you go
49:30
through yourself and see or watch or or
49:32
understand what they gave their lives
49:35
you cannot escape being rewarded you're
49:38
not gonna god's gonna make sure you
49:39
don't miss the rewards there's rewards
49:41
now in this life but the ones throughout
49:44
eternity
49:45
and and there's more than just a
49:47
memorial there's places uh
49:49
that have i know it talks about thrones
49:51
around heaven all in heaven and there
49:53
are people who sit on them sometimes
49:55
they get to make some decisions or uh
49:57
maybe people come by just to meet them
49:59
it's not like they're ruling over heaven
50:02
it's just a place of honor there's
50:04
places of honor that maybe they're not
50:06
there all the time but they have
50:07
opportunities to sit there and people
50:08
want to come to see him or something
50:10
like that it's it's beyond your normal
50:12
understanding
50:14
but you're never going to be bored with
50:16
anything that's there it's always going
50:19
to be captivating exciting
50:24
being not bored you've talked a number
50:26
of times about that that you can
50:27
actually be part of making a
50:30
film you could people go to the theater
50:33
and they can watch you at the theater
50:36
if i'm
50:37
you know you correct my language if i'm
50:39
saying this right
50:40
right or wrong but
50:42
the people have written to me a number
50:43
of times and says how is it possible for
50:46
let's say make a john wayne movie with
50:49
john wayne in there
50:51
and some and people going what is there
50:53
to do other than ride a horse
50:56
um you know what i'm saying how does i i
50:58
don't know how does a storyline
51:01
get built into a movie in heaven with
51:04
with zero
51:05
gun shooting and all of that
51:09
specific
51:10
maybe
51:11
maybe i'm saying it wrong but have you
51:13
seen specific movies or parts of them we
51:16
know even when they make movies down
51:18
here they don't actually kill people
51:19
right right that is true last time
51:25
those guns they use here down here
51:28
making movies uh people aren't probably
51:30
really associated much with the
51:32
producing but i've seen both sides of it
51:34
and i understand the making of a movie
51:37
and by the way that's why all those
51:38
credits keep going by forever because
51:40
all those people are parts of making
51:41
this look good the special effects part
51:44
you know the sound part the the film
51:46
part the costumes i mean script people
51:49
and screenwriters and it's more than
51:52
that what you see on the film the few
51:53
people you see in that film it took
51:55
thousands to make that happen
51:57
uh in heaven it's kind of the same way
51:59
there's still things that make things
52:01
happen now they're not going to show
52:02
there's no movies with gore or people
52:05
being murdered or stuff that doesn't
52:07
exist but there are exciting intense fun
52:11
different things to see in movies
52:13
and yeah he could do a cattle drive
52:15
stuff sort of like that take people and
52:17
categorize for the first time and
52:19
some of them are funny because you know
52:20
john wayne had an actual funny side
52:22
there's no
52:24
no
52:24
profanity
52:27
it doesn't exist in heaven not even
52:29
explaining or showing things there's no
52:31
profanity so you're not going to see a
52:33
lot of swearing or sexual things or
52:36
witchcraft not at all
52:39
no extreme no violence of any kind no
52:42
one dying suffering or agony but you
52:44
know why because they're highly gifted
52:47
and it's good when they make things
52:48
people want to go see these things made
52:50
by people who know jesus christ john
52:52
wayne accepted jesus christ that's
52:54
really known in many places
52:57
his daughter was there present when she
52:58
received christ and it was while he was
53:01
watching a show i think the crystal
53:02
cathedral so stop knocking them people
53:05
uh when they had a meeting there and led
53:07
people to christ that was the time when
53:08
john wayne in his own room
53:11
not there yes and he was in a lot of
53:14
pain at the time and um they said if
53:16
possible get on your knees i know this
53:18
all to be true and so his i don't know
53:21
if his daughter helped him he said i'm
53:22
getting on my knees he got off of his
53:24
bed
53:25
um and got on your knees and received
53:28
jesus christ and saved yourself
53:31
so the movie
53:32
the movie group in heaven were the
53:34
production people were really happy when
53:36
john wayne showed up
53:40
so there is there's like shooting and
53:42
stuff and uh like things like that but
53:44
there's no blood being splattered
53:46
anywhere and there's not real bullets
53:48
and
53:49
um now i could tell you this when you go
53:51
on hunts up in the mountain of spices
53:54
the only way you shoot things is with
53:56
the camera scope and you're taking the
53:57
pictures going back to this big
53:59
clubhouse they have there people are
54:01
shaking their hands saying you're nuts
54:02
well then you're saying heaven is nuts
54:04
and you haven't been there so forget it
54:06
hello so
54:08
these things we enjoy on the earth
54:10
there's just a different way they do it
54:11
in heaven but it's just as exciting
54:13
intense funny amazing captivating and as
54:17
the father tells me all the time he said
54:21
i would be in trouble if i have said you
54:23
must come like a little child and
54:24
there's not fun here
54:28
so there's a lot of fun and exciting
54:30
things to do in heaven and people have
54:32
gifts on the earth that did stuff
54:34
similar in heaven but it's so much more
54:36
fantastic so that all ties back to the
54:39
whole salon thing the reason why there
54:41
will be is because god gifted people
54:43
with that so he has to make a way for
54:45
them to use that gift in heaven no
54:47
matter whether it's a baker a painter a
54:50
designer
54:51
a director an events planner
54:54
those those rodeos i mean amusement
54:56
parks people have to have gifts to
54:59
create those things the only thing not
55:02
in them is evil wickedness darkness but
55:05
that doesn't mean you're not going to
55:07
have a good time i never cared for the
55:09
dark stuff
55:11
yeah awesome um speaking of fun now this
55:15
because i don't know if the dinosaurs
55:18
lived at the same time that adam and eve
55:19
did or not but it says did adam name the
55:22
dinosaurs were there dinosaurs on the
55:24
ark well probably not in the ark right
55:28
i i think the alligator may be the only
55:30
remnant left of them
55:34
and they they kind of look like one but
55:36
in the much smaller scale i mean really
55:38
kind of similar they were like
55:40
they were on the earth when he made it
55:43
the first time which is another whole
55:45
show
55:48
when it says in the beginning
55:51
god created the heavens and the earth
55:54
okay
55:55
uh there's a time when he made the earth
55:58
that mankind was not on the earth yet he
56:00
made it it was beautiful
56:03
there was no sun to light it it was lit
56:06
by his glory
56:07
and there's a scripture i think in
56:09
jeremiah that talks about when god
56:11
turned the light out
56:13
um
56:14
and then there was darkness upon the
56:16
deep so between verses one and two
56:19
are millions of years if you're not in
56:21
that group
56:22
you'll get over it when you get to
56:24
heaven and find out but when the
56:26
dinosaurs were made when he first made
56:28
the earth i was taken back i saw it it
56:31
was uh the sky was like a peachy pink
56:34
um and there was this water vapor shield
56:36
that he put around the original earth uh
56:39
it's still the same landmass by the way
56:42
and it was round back then
56:44
not flat how about that so when he made
56:47
the earth the first time he made it um
56:50
and
56:51
there was no storms there was no raining
56:54
on the earth so we had to have a way
56:56
to water these hundred foot high flowers
56:58
that i saw there they had forest of
57:00
flowers a small dinosaur could actually
57:03
go stand under one if they wanted to
57:05
uh none of the dinosaurs ate flesh at
57:09
when they first made they ate the
57:11
vegetation they ate the seeds they eat
57:14
the fruit that's what he gave them to
57:16
eat when he first made them they weren't
57:18
wild they weren't them you know harmful
57:21
that happened when satan was cast out of
57:24
heaven
57:25
uh but when he made the earth there was
57:26
time it was beautiful it was such peace
57:29
he put watcher angels who have flesh on
57:32
them on the earth to care for the
57:33
dinosaurs and they would talk to them
57:36
dinosaurs talk after them and so that
57:38
was during that time
57:40
uh when he
57:42
flooded the earth with water the first
57:44
time this was before noah's ark and it
57:47
clearly says in verse two that there was
57:49
darkness upon the face of the deep right
57:51
that was the water and this in the
57:53
spirit hovered over it and god was about
57:56
to remake the earth that so before that
57:59
time was when the dinosaurs existed uh
58:01
there were no cro-magnon men there was
58:03
no cavemen at that time it was just
58:05
god's creatures and the water angels on
58:08
this beautiful earth which you will get
58:09
to see when you get to heaven by the way
58:11
you see all of it happening
58:13
uh and then when he began when he
58:14
decided okay satan's trying to destroy
58:17
the earth and mess it up because he he
58:19
is actually the one who
58:22
made the dinosaurs bad well they began
58:24
to eat each other
58:26
and redestruction on the earth and satan
58:28
began to make it a wilderness which it
58:30
says in the bible it says he began to
58:32
make the earth a wilderness it says that
58:34
this is the original earth and was
58:37
causing destruction on the earth that's
58:39
why god took the light away it says he
58:42
turned the light out he took his glory
58:44
off the earth that brought the darkness
58:46
and then he began uh to break the water
58:49
vapor shield that had twice as much
58:51
water in it that brought a mist down so
58:54
the mist used to come from there and
58:55
from the earth itself and that's how the
58:57
flowers got the water and the dinosaurs
59:00
hide was i can tell you this you can't
59:02
take a dinosaur and stick them in the
59:03
desert but they have found their their
59:05
bones in the desert because that part
59:07
used to have ocean in it
59:10
you can't take a hide this thick and not
59:12
keep water on even alligators crocodiles
59:15
have to stay in the water most of the
59:16
time they come out in the sun for a
59:18
while but if they got trapped out of the
59:20
water that high would eventually crack
59:22
and fall apart so there's all kinds of
59:25
evidence around us that something
59:26
existed before our time and people try
59:29
to make it something else god made the
59:31
earth the first time lit it with his
59:32
glory made this whole system with his
59:35
water vapor shield and then he put two
59:37
handfuls of water on it another water
59:40
vapor shield and it was like being in
59:43
an atrium
59:44
and his glory lift that whole earth so
59:47
with the mist coming and the light of
59:49
the glory it made the sky
59:51
not blue they even need oxygen at that
59:54
time because this was before the fall
59:56
this is before
59:58
the fault happened and things were just
60:00
different run different in verse two
60:03
there's destruction that's happened on
60:05
the earth there's even water on the sky
60:07
it says you remove the water off the
60:09
permanent the firmament is the sky
60:11
so all these in verse two all this stuff
60:14
has happened he didn't make it that way
60:16
and then it says
60:17
clearly he began to replenish the earth
60:22
in other words he was putting it back
60:24
together removing all the excess water
60:26
off of it drying it out where it need to
60:29
be dried out and then he began to
60:31
replenish the earth with the with the
60:33
creatures with the birds and all that
60:35
stuff and then of course we know on the
60:38
sixth day he decided to make man so
60:40
there's you a little bit of a big
60:41
picture that happened
60:43
so the gun way back when um the the
60:46
watcher angels were the ones who cared
60:48
for them and were on the earth with them
60:50
so i do not believe there were actual
60:52
dinosaur dinosaurs i know they show the
60:54
loch ness monster
60:56
in scotland we were there i didn't see
60:58
them by the way
61:00
yeah because we were there too they
61:02
paint the
61:03
on the boat that you take the tour at
61:05
loch ness and then you got a picture of
61:07
the dinos what is it the monster
61:10
on the glass
61:12
messy yeah that's what it was and then
61:14
you see i was taking pictures of the
61:16
glass um okay two more quick questions
61:19
to wrap up uh do our angels
61:23
my apologies do our angels know our
61:26
destiny
61:28
i think most assuredly your guardian
61:31
angels
61:32
know what your destiny is because they
61:34
try to keep you on track
61:37
yeah they do more than just standing
61:39
with a sword you know trying to kill
61:41
anything comes by you
61:43
they they
61:44
they give up they will say things to you
61:46
that will either um
61:48
help heal your soul or maybe inspire
61:50
your soul they'll give you thoughts that
61:53
lead you towards christ they'll give you
61:55
thoughts of ways to fix things
61:57
uh
61:58
they probably help people the people who
62:01
are going to be like creators of
62:02
inventions i'm sure that they help them
62:04
even in that by saying things to them
62:05
that would help them do their inventions
62:07
and stuff like that
62:08
they i do know this they're sent at the
62:11
time of conception
62:12
when you are conceived in your mother's
62:14
room your guardian angels are sent then
62:17
and i will see them walking around
62:18
pregnant women and they're waiting on
62:20
the baby to be born so guess what uh
62:23
just so the left nose there were
62:25
witnesses to what you did to those
62:27
babies
62:28
and no one in heaven is happy about it i
62:31
just had to add that for free but your
62:33
guardian angel is sent at the time of
62:34
conception you are something already
62:37
when he takes that little spirit of life
62:39
from himself and he gets knitted and
62:42
attached to that dot of flesh
62:44
that is your spirit man man cannot make
62:46
the spirit we can't make the spirit okay
62:50
that has to come from god and so at the
62:52
time of conception that's when he sends
62:54
that little spirit of life it talks
62:56
about in the bible when he blew into
62:58
adam's nostrils he takes that and
62:59
attaches it in the mother's womb your
63:02
guardian angels are sent right then
63:03
everybody has more than one because one
63:06
has to take a break and go back to
63:07
heaven and come back
63:09
it says that your angel always is before
63:11
the face of god that means one or the
63:13
other is up there talking about you
63:15
maybe things you need help with and
63:17
maybe things you need to know about
63:19
they're getting some instructions from
63:21
the father to come back but you always
63:23
have one with you all the time
63:26
when you die and step out of this body
63:29
your spirit man steps out the first
63:30
thing you will see will be your own
63:32
guardian angel
63:33
waiting to help escort you to heaven
63:36
nice but i'll be fine that'll be fun
63:38
okay last question are there creatures
63:41
from earth that don't exist in heaven we
63:44
know and that this person wrote we know
63:46
it's the opposite is true that there are
63:47
things on heaven that are not on earth
63:50
are there things on the earth
63:52
creatures that are not in heaven
63:55
i think it wouldn't be the creatures i
63:57
think it would be insects
63:59
oh yeah
64:00
well
64:02
it would be impacting just me yeah i've
64:05
seen every kind of creature that i have
64:07
seen physically on this earth they are
64:09
in heaven
64:10
they're in heaven they're different in
64:12
heaven they have a real life in heaven
64:15
uh every creature can communicate or
64:17
talk to any of the people who are in
64:19
heaven
64:20
um
64:21
they are not eaten in heaven i might as
64:24
well add that nobody goes and shoots or
64:25
kills these creatures who have a real
64:27
life uh god towed noah put every
64:31
creature on the ark that has a spirit of
64:33
life in them that's a spiritual body
64:35
with the soul in it but those on the ark
64:38
okay those are the ones you put on the
64:39
ark
64:40
and there's a reason for that so so when
64:43
creatures die they go to heaven
64:46
and often quite all of your pets go to
64:48
heaven every one of your pets that
64:49
passed away your own guardian angel
64:51
escorts your pet i'll talk about the
64:53
past escort your pet to heaven
64:56
but every kind of thing i've seen
64:58
literally that exists right now on the
65:00
earth the creatures i've seen um some of
65:03
them in heaven
65:04
so but i've seen creatures in heaven
65:07
that were never on the earth i think
65:09
that's the mystery part that's some of
65:11
the wonders that you get to see in
65:13
heaven the things that you never saw
65:15
on this earth that exist in heaven he
65:17
has a lot more there than what he put he
65:19
put some of them on the earth some of
65:21
them you never put on the earth
65:23
yeah
65:24
awesome well cat tell people about
65:26
revealing heaven.com what can they get
65:28
there
65:30
well they can get get my my books my
65:32
products revealingheaven.com is where my
65:36
my company operates and sells the
65:39
product sets up the events and that type
65:41
of thing happens there i think you can
65:44
see some testimonies on that
65:46
and then um so that's where you go to do
65:48
that type of thing i think i have a copy
65:50
of my book somewhere i was just going to
65:52
show my book and now i don't know yeah
65:53
there's a great book i've read the books
65:55
and they're really really good i hope
65:57
people yeah so i have one here i was
65:59
just going to show it to everybody here
66:01
is the book right here it's called
66:03
revealing heaven
66:05
and you see the wing with some of the
66:07
eyes in it and the holy spirit makes me
66:09
laugh all the time he said when you put
66:10
the wing of the living creature on the
66:12
book make sure half's on the front
66:14
half's on the back some people won't
66:16
like your book in the bookstore they'll
66:17
turn it around well if they turn it
66:19
around
66:20
they wouldn't see more of them
66:24
and they'll see me with my pink hair
66:26
that was their plan not mine and so this
66:29
is book one right here i've got book one
66:31
book two totally different uh
66:33
stories and encounters in both of those
66:36
books different places in heaven and
66:38
i'll just show some people there are
66:40
illustrations in this book
66:42
um this would be one of the nursery
66:44
walls in heaven where little babies have
66:46
these beautiful little things they sleep
66:47
and they don't have like a hard bed uh
66:49
beautiful like a big seashells with
66:51
glorious fabrics on it birds flying and
66:54
take them for rides roses and flowers
66:57
grow out of the wall that sing to these
66:58
babies the angels will take them and
67:00
hold them and rock them and sing to them
67:03
and as i've said before babies grow so
67:05
very slow that they're still young when
67:07
you go to heaven later
67:09
and so there's there's all kinds of
67:11
illustrations in this book
67:13
one day we'll make a coffee table book
67:15
with them all in color here's one of uh
67:18
two guardian angels taking the person
67:20
home that they watch
67:23
and uh so the guardian angels look
67:26
mostly like people with wings your
67:28
guardian angels are different than the
67:29
army most of the army are creature-like
67:31
looking things with like eight eyes and
67:33
stuff like that that's so they can see
67:35
the enemy that would be satan and the
67:37
dark army in the front or the back they
67:39
have eyes on the back of the head this
67:41
is a transport
67:42
and uh there's no steps attached to
67:44
anything she walks on steps floating in
67:46
air she was in her 90s when she passed
67:49
away
67:50
her nickname was mrs matt
67:52
and these are her guardian angels who
67:54
escorting her home to heaven
67:56
so this book has illustrations of heaven
67:59
in it and uh
68:00
but a lot of a powerful evidence that
68:02
heaven is real so you would get that one
68:04
or book two we have audio books we now
68:06
have them on uh digital i think like on
68:09
flash drives or downloadable we have got
68:12
so many revelations now we still we do
68:15
still sell cds and dvds and i've been
68:19
told to let them go but there's still
68:20
people out there buying them and they
68:22
don't do digital stuff on the computer
68:24
yet so
68:25
we want everyone to have a chance to
68:27
have it but there's all kinds of
68:29
revelations on the cds dvds some of them
68:32
are um have some instructional stuff on
68:34
it and one thing we'll be adding is a
68:37
lullaby i have an amazing highly gifted
68:40
person who went to the boston
68:42
conservatory of music who sings opera
68:45
and we will be making some cds together
68:48
or even maybe dvds where you'll actually
68:50
hear this beautiful singing songs about
68:52
heaven and then i will be prophesying or
68:54
declaring over your babies over your
68:56
children is something that we will do
68:58
next year this year sorry this year
69:00
sometime this year maybe close to the
69:02
close of the end we'll have all kinds of
69:04
music available eventually that sings
69:06
about heaven
69:07
but so this will be added but we have so
69:09
much revelation i all will help you
69:12
find out about when the earth began what
69:14
that was like the ancient past we have
69:16
um i'm trying to remember the name now
69:19
we have copycat which shows about
69:21
everything that satan has stolen images
69:23
and things that he stole from god and
69:25
perverts them on the earth and then we
69:27
have all kinds of things like the
69:28
kingdom age we have um uh i can't
69:31
remember all the titles marked which is
69:33
for young people
69:35
and it's showing a young person with
69:36
tattoos on their arms or remarks of god
69:39
and talks about what he's going to do
69:40
with that generation in these days
69:42
coming up i release that at a a youth
69:45
thing with 3 000 youth in it and then
69:48
released the lightning power of god into
69:49
every single one of them it was one of
69:51
the most powerful meanings i had
69:53
so a lot of these are events that took
69:55
place since the anointing and the glory
69:57
are on them and you can just so go go to
70:00
to regainingheaven.com and see
70:03
we also do things like i've always
70:04
showed this cup i don't
70:07
right here
70:10
and we try to produce things that
70:12
represent heaven or speak against our
70:14
enemy which would be the devil
70:17
and so there's a lot going on there and
70:18
then i also have oh we even have these
70:21
simple little things like um
70:23
this is we have these little tent cards
70:25
and this is the thing you declare about
70:27
getting grace for abundant life oh god
70:31
and on this side is the prayer the
70:33
declaration you make over your loved
70:34
ones who are not saved
70:36
this is what he said this is what he
70:38
said to tell them to declare and so
70:41
these don't cost almost nothing i think
70:43
and you can add it to any any kind of
70:45
order i'm just going to read what it
70:46
says father i declare that all of my
70:49
family my friends and those that i love
70:51
will become mighty children of god they
70:54
will be free in jesus name they will not
70:56
miss their destiny they will become the
70:58
living testimony of the saving power of
71:00
jesus christ amen
71:02
and that is what uh they have me bring
71:05
back to the earth to tell people you
71:06
declare that over your family members
71:09
and they were they father
71:15
so he gave me the exact
71:17
prayer decree to me
71:20
and then he promised you you
71:23
do this and i'll do that right exactly
71:26
and he's very serious because you know
71:28
even jesus did that
71:30
the famous prayer all right our father
71:33
who is in heaven holy is your name that
71:35
whole thing came from jesus christ this
71:38
is from jesus christ and the father if
71:40
you don't know how to pray for them you
71:42
don't have to tell god how bad and
71:43
wicked they are by the way he knows that
71:46
and i want to add one more you're making
71:48
a stand this is important if you're
71:49
making a stand for someone in your
71:51
family or people who are like family to
71:53
know christ
71:54
don't make the declaration then turn
71:56
around and tell everybody how bad and
71:57
wicked they are not all the time in
71:59
other words if you're giving a testimony
72:01
to somebody that's different but i'm
72:03
just saying you can't be double-minded
72:06
this is your mind set on a of course for
72:09
your family ones or loved ones to know
72:10
jesus okay hold it up right there
72:13
but if you just ask for the declaration
72:15
card it's on uh when you go to order
72:17
something you can always add this you
72:18
can send it to other people so they'll
72:20
know about it so we want to help people
72:23
get into heaven and this is just a good
72:25
way to do it and and you know the word
72:28
says i got to add one more thing the
72:30
word says it's appointed under man to
72:32
die
72:33
wants to die and then the judgment
72:37
i want to assure you that word judgment
72:40
does not talk about the great white
72:41
throne judgment it is not talking about
72:43
the judgment seat of christ it's when
72:45
you die there is a judgment made is
72:49
there someone out there standing for
72:50
them can christ
72:52
use the keys to hell death in the grave
72:56
to do something about your declaration
72:59
because he will and that's why it says
73:01
it's appointed unto me and wants to die
73:03
and then the judgment
73:05
okay that's right when you die there's a
73:06
judgment made
73:08
had these people ever declared have they
73:10
ever asked jesus christ into their heart
73:13
is there someone standing for them to
73:15
make that happen to give time for that
73:16
to happen and this was adamant jesus
73:19
christ was adamant about telling you
73:21
about this so there is ways and jesus
73:24
said to me some people will be shocked
73:26
to see who made it but it was because
73:28
they
73:29
made a stand and didn't get off of that
73:32
stand they kept that stand stand there
73:34
for
73:35
and don't change what you're saying
73:37
about your family members or your
73:38
friends and then there's catker.com
73:40
where you get all kinds of revelation
73:42
training
73:43
um powerful things and it is the only
73:46
way that you can give to me online is to
73:48
go to catcure.com click on the treasury
73:51
and yes you can become a guardian we
73:53
have the guardian zone that's all those
73:55
who give to us we just sent out all of
73:57
our letters to people we sending out the
73:59
gifts that we have purchased for them
74:01
for the guardian zone and i want to say
74:03
like steve
74:04

74:07
you help make it happen and i want to
74:10

74:12
get the same reward we do when you
74:14

74:19
that is a surety so thank you for all
74:22
those who give make sure you do give to
74:24
the elijah list because you wouldn't be
74:25
hearing the prophets right now those who
74:27
are speaking truth the truth makes you
74:30
free
74:31
not just not man's mindset
74:34
not means assumptions not man's plans
74:37
not threats of the enemy but the truth
74:39
makes you free and steve helps to make
74:42
that happen by giving the the microphone

to the prophecy gives us the platform so
74:47
you can know about god know about jesus
74:50

74:54
i am grateful and i thank the father
74:56

75:00
doreen
75:01
in jesus name because i'm bringing him
75:03
to remembrance of all that he has done
75:06
father all that he has done that you
75:07
have asked him to do even to his own
75:10
hurt he has not stopped putting forth
75:13
the true word of god and let the
75:16
prophets be heard who are telling the
75:19
truth that he knows
75:21
and i thank you god for setting steve in
75:24
the place you have given and the
75:26
authority you have given him and i pray
75:28
that every demon flee from him when he
75:30
goes into a place that they shake and
75:32
tremble in fear when he wakes up in the
75:34
morning and feels the presence of the
75:36
living god and gives voice to those who
75:39
speak for him and won't hold back

hey happy wednesday february 9 2022
01:38
welcome to the broadcast uh by the way
01:40
jeff in case we didn't talk about this
01:42
uh or in case we weren't ready to be
01:43
sure to get that video ready we're going
01:45
to run that in a minute so i wanted to
01:47
tell you about the um
01:49
the wells that we are digging that you
01:51
are digging um it's all paid for by you
01:55
our viewers and we're now doing three
01:57
wells a month in uganda so we're going
01:59
to show you uh two things we're going to
02:01
show you a brand new video about the
02:04
wells that are being dug and then at the
02:06
end of the video we're going to show you
02:08
a map of where these wells um are it's
02:11
amazing amazing amazing so this is just
02:14
to remind people that we're in
02:16
partnership with show mercy
02:18
you can find them at
02:19
showmercy.org just like it sounds mike
02:22
and laurie sally uh they are the ones um
02:25
with the village
02:26
called field of dreams in uganda
02:29
and then we're partnering with them to
02:30
get these wells drilled so it's a it's a
02:33
twofer we're both doing it together and
02:35
you'll see the sign
02:37
where it talks about elijah's streams
02:39
and show mercy
02:41
so
02:42
without further ado let's play that
02:44
video jeff
02:55
[Music]
03:15
[Music]
03:25
so
03:27
[Music]
03:35
[Music]
03:47
[Music]
04:50
[Music]
04:58
[Music]
05:01
hello
05:08
[Music]
05:13
wow is that not amazing
05:15
you all did this the reward goes to you
05:18
you're the one that sends in the money
05:20
we take your uh income and we we take
05:23
what you send in we spend uh ten
05:25
thousand dollars per well i think we're
05:28
on well let's look at the map if you can
05:30
put that map up i think it's ten all the
05:33
blues are wells that are finished now
05:36
and if it was bigger i'd read the names
05:38
of these villages every single one of
05:40
those is in a different village and then
05:42
the yellows are the next three uh wells
05:44
i believe though the yellows are the
05:46
february wells that we're digging and we
05:49
plan to keep going we're going to do
05:50
three wells a month all year long and
05:52
don't expect us to stop because we're on
05:54
a roll uh the the people
05:57
mike and laurie have expressed that that
05:59
there's so much more favor they have
06:01
in this whole region in the community
06:03
people now know
06:05
that elijah's dreams and show mercy
06:08
field of dreams are doing are doing this
06:12
and so now they're very very open the
06:13
gospel is being shared
06:16
each of the wells are prayed over and
06:17
anointed and
06:19
as they're finished pastor fred i think
06:21
is his name is helping get this done so
06:24
uh he's one of the the the native
06:26
peoples i'm not sure what you'd say
06:28
though the local
06:30
um
06:31
people
06:32
and he's the pastor there and he's
06:34
helping mike and laura get this done but
06:36
bless you bless you bless you i think at
06:37
the end of every one of our
06:39
videos or every one of our streams
06:41
there's a way to donate there's a link
06:44
uh we put the link on the chat and we
06:47
put the link in below
06:49
youtube we try to put it different
06:50
places so you can donate or mail a check
06:53
we appreciate that so much it not only
06:55
helps us keep this program going but you
06:56
can see where this is going
06:58
and
06:59
i think like i said i think we're at
07:01
well 10
07:02
now it's something like that i'm losing
07:04
track because it's an odd number because
07:06
we started with only one and then we
07:08
started doing two a month and now we're
07:10
doing three a month we will very likely
07:12
increase the number of wells rather than
07:15
decrease it so we'll see what god does
07:17
but isn't that amazing thank you all for
07:19
what you're doing for thank you for
07:20
generosity on behalf of the lord you
07:22
know the lord you saw that scripture you
07:24
even if you give so much as a cup of
07:26
cold water to one of these you will not
07:29
lose your reward if you sent money in
07:32
knowing that a good deal of art we tithe
07:35
out of that and the tithe
07:37
a significant portion of the tithe we
07:39
get
07:39
out of elijah's streams goes right to
07:41
these wells too and then the gospel is
07:43
shared so just wanted to really uh thank
07:46
you thank you thank you all for doing
07:47
that so all right well without further
07:49
ado let's bring kat in here
07:52
hey
07:53
did you see all of our wells there did
07:55
you see that i did that is amazing i'm
07:58
telling you that so blessed is the heart
08:00
of god i know it's helping the people
08:02
but it really is part of what the father
08:04
wants us to do he wants us to reach out
08:06
to be kind to care
08:08
which um obviously the left cares for
08:10
nothing but we do we have to we we
08:12
follow jesus christ and you know he
08:15
helped he fed the people everywhere he
08:16
went he would they did he would give
08:18
them water and so that is just a normal
08:21
thing to do as a believer is to reach
08:23
out and help people so i am really
08:26
um excited about what y'all are it's
08:28
just you know i just haven't had this
08:30
much fun
08:31
years and people might have heard me say
08:33
it was 1987 where god spoke to me in the
08:35
middle of night and he said well
08:37
ministries and then he said little
08:39
orphan children now they're not all
08:41
orphans but they're all children yeah
08:43
and um
08:44
it's in and then finally so whatever
08:46
that was 30 some years and then we
08:49
finally got to obey the word of the lord
08:51
but
08:52
maybe i should have started before that
08:54
but uh and when i had that word we were
08:56
pretty darn poor i was just telling my
08:58
step about yeah i think he was just
09:00
talking about the future steve what you
09:02
know
09:03
you're part of the prophetic that's what
09:04
happens he'll say something to you it
09:07
could be 10 20 30. there's things he
09:10
showed me 45 years ago that we're just
09:12
not stepping into but i knew it would
09:14
always happen it's like i never stopped
09:16
believing
09:18
like you there's no way it could happen
09:20
back then anyway
09:22
we were trying to just eat back then in
09:24
those days you know growing up but you
09:26
know what even trying to eat ourselves
09:28
we still shared with other people
09:30
and uh we were always continually
09:32
getting blessed we we had basic stuff
09:35
probably but we were so happy that we
09:37
loved helping people and we would take
09:39
even in the 60s when the there were all
09:42
the flop houses where the
09:43
the young people would gather to take
09:45
drugs my dad would take big pots of stew
09:47
and soon
09:48
and they'd always let you come if you're
09:50
going to feed him then he'd cheer jesus
09:52
and some of those very people turned up
09:54
to be revivalists and evangelists in
09:56
these days wow so you never know like
09:59
what you're helping the ones you're
10:00
helping there you never know what
10:02
they're or who they're going to become
10:04
for god so you're seating in the lives
10:07
of future
10:08
leaders probably in the world right now
10:12
that's just so amazing we had another
10:14
place in uganda that did contact us and
10:17
we're looking at that as a as a
10:19
secondary place to to drill wells so um
10:23
god's really got our our focus on these
10:25
wells um you know it's just so amazing
10:28
because you see every single well
10:31
and uh lori wrote to me the other day
10:32
and she said already through these wells
10:35
that you saw on that map thousands of
10:37
people are using that one and a thousand
10:39
she said so
10:41
it's just
10:42
you can tell i'm excited about it you
10:43
can really tell that i'm
10:45
too because you know growing up with my
10:48
dad who he was
10:50
sir he touched probably probably
10:53
hundreds of thousands of people in his
10:54
lifetime
10:56
dropping them and i mean we would we
10:58
would really help people that were
10:59
abandoned or or
11:02
something
11:03
and we would work with them sometimes a
11:05
couple of years getting them a place
11:06
getting them clothes i mean we would
11:08
give our own stuff away even though we
11:09
didn't have
11:10
and we i actually still carry that on
11:13
now in my own life if people need
11:15
something sometimes my husband have to
11:17
get used to i say go get us go find a
11:20
truck get a rental truck and we take our
11:22
almost a half a household of our
11:24
furniture
11:25
somebody who had none and we didn't give
11:27
them the old beat up stuff we gave them
11:30
the brand new stuff and i my heart would
11:32
just be so excited and so happy that we
11:35
got to make a difference so i i
11:37
understand what that is like it truly is
11:39
truly truly is more blessed to give
11:42
than receive it's like they're enjoying
11:44
that so much and we're enjoying it a
11:46
whole lot more if it can be
11:48
possible so
11:49
well kathleen you know we're in amazing
11:52
times this even seems like an amazing
11:54
month amazing week amazing day and what
11:57
what's on your heart to share about
11:59
current events before we get into
12:00
questions every day things are changing
12:03
and i'm telling you no matter what
12:04
you're hearing in other news sources
12:07
it's all downhill for the left i just
12:10
have to say the truth you know i'm
12:12
always going to tell the truth besides
12:14
what the father son and holy spirit are
12:15
sharing with me personally that they
12:17
showed me months and months ago
12:20
is happening right now
12:22
they're not going to tell you uh who is
12:25
who is coming forward to be witnesses
12:26
they're not going to give a lot of that
12:28
out until the hammer really falls on all
12:30
of them but i can tell you the
12:32
foundation is totally getting into
12:34
crumbles right now
12:36
and every time this is a sign you can
12:38
tell when they start adding insane
12:41
things i'm talking about the laugh and
12:43
they start adding insane things on their
12:45
list of to do uh you know they're
12:47
desperate
12:48
because you know why they're adding new
12:50
stuff that is dangerous or that is
12:52
criminal activity the other stuff is not
12:54
working
12:56
yeah
12:56
no hell cannot create anything good it
12:59
just gets worse and worse that's what
13:01
happens when you give yourself into the
13:02
darkness it only gets worse and worse
13:04
people there's never going to be any
13:06
better or good in any of that uh evil is
13:09
not good okay
13:11
yeah
13:12
it is bad and this is the worst thing
13:15
you could be involved in but more and
13:17
more people are standing up the everyday
13:19
um citizen
13:21
not just in america but even canada as
13:23
you well know yeah people are watching
13:25
those truckers and
13:27
uh we did have something very
13:28
significant happened since our last
13:31
broadcast
13:32
that you all know about the caravan the
13:34
convoy
13:36
that has gone across to the country of
13:38
canada well god says north american
13:41
continent that has gone uh from there
13:43
it's header thing to ottawa or or way
13:46
over to the from going from the
13:48
west to the east area in canada and uh
13:51
there's tens of thousands of truckers
13:54
people in case they're lying to you
13:55
about it i know they've heard from their
13:58
um their leader uh who's never going to
14:01
tell you the truth either you know not
14:03
even in canada their leader is not going
14:05
to tell the truth and they've been
14:06
putting up with him for a long time
14:08
because i know i have a lot of friends
14:10
in canada and they've always been not
14:11
just complaining but fed up with the
14:14
illegal regulations and laws he's been
14:17
making
14:18
and uh so this convoy really was quite a
14:21
shock to him he didn't expect this
14:23
backlash against all of his stuff that
14:25
he's saying
14:26
people tend to want to be free
14:29
and they're fed up with what's going on
14:31
and so this convoy started with just a
14:33
few hundred trucks i i forgot close to
14:36
like fifty thousand that sounds like
14:38
insane right but that is really what's
14:40
going on and they've gone across all of
14:42
canada and people are coming out
14:46
by the dozens if not hundreds in some
14:48
places to feed these truckers i mean
14:51
wherever they stop like for the night or
14:53
if they take a break people are there
14:54
with food with supplies
14:58
bringing gas and i mean it's just
15:00
craziness to see what a good crazy uh to
15:03
see how these people are pulling
15:04
together because they know these
15:06
truckers are not just there representing
15:08
them they're representing the people in
15:10
canada and the people are with them
15:13
because they know this is for their good
15:16
well the the t person
15:20
their leader that i don't know what's
15:22
gone wrong with his brain either he made
15:24
a decision i'm going to do something
15:26
this is just got to stop it's got to
15:27
stop so he contacted all these big
15:30
industries that had this massive um like
15:33
commercial grade tractors when i say
15:34
tractor on commercial grade tractors he
15:37
was going to send them all to this line
15:39
of this big convoy and begin to bust it
15:41
up and break it up because when people
15:43
get united it is very dangerous
15:46
[Laughter]
15:47
you didn't like this whole picture
15:49
because you know people have they have
15:51
their cell phones and they can't hide
15:52
the truth of being shown
15:54
and of what's really going on they're
15:56
making a stand for their freedom and so
15:59
he decided i'll stop this right now and
16:02
i forgot how many hundreds of these huge
16:05
massive tractors he contacted these
16:06
commercial farmers said you will go
16:08
there you will bust this thing up and
16:11
end it and so all these massive tractors
16:14
came up alongside where the convoy was
16:17
and instead of making them get out and
16:19
and stop or either take their stuff or
16:21
make them move they got out and stood
16:23
alongside them
16:27
and said we are together with you that
16:30
is freaking out their leader now what is
16:32
he gonna do now right uh they're saying
16:34
we're making a stand too we want to be
16:36
free too so we're not forcing them to
16:38
end this we're a part of it
16:40
[Laughter]
16:42
oh man isn't it fun watching people get
16:45
united you know and when you get united
16:47
against egypt you know what this i know
16:50
was a god thing because let me tell you
16:51
there are praying people in canada yeah
16:54
i was told a long time ago don't go
16:55
there it's dark when i'm sorry
16:57
everywhere i went i saw light light in
16:59
the people light and regions there uh
17:02
they've had some very important people
17:04
just come from the area and bring the
17:06
truth many many places in america too
17:09
uh but they're making a stand and when
17:11
it only takes one or two people to
17:13
finally stand and say we're not having
17:15
this anymore we're doing something about
17:17
it we're going to let them know we're
17:19
not afraid of them we're making a stand
17:21
we are going to be free and and now that
17:24
stand is just increased because instead
17:26
of sending someone against them to stop
17:28
it they are joining them knowing from
17:31
the very moment that they got that
17:33
called this is what you will do oh they
17:35
went there but they're not making them
17:37
stop so i'm celebrating all of you uh
17:40
farmers and people in canada who came
17:43
alongside the the they their people
17:46
there
17:46
to bring freedom to all them i
17:48
congratulate you and celebrate
17:50
awesome and you know i'm hearing that
17:53
this is about to um be released the
17:55
truckers in the united states i
17:57
understand that this is just a rumor but
17:59
the rumor is on super bowl sunday which
18:02
is this sunday that after the super bowl
18:04
the truckers are going to start from in
18:05
l.a heading back east so if that's true
18:09
we're about to witness uh probably
18:12
what canada is doing even in an increase
18:14
even more so
18:16
um because the the population is greater
18:18
in the united states so they can do more
18:20
so
18:21
and you're right they are really trying
18:23
they're they're trying their best not to
18:24
interrupt you but i'm so excited they're
18:27
trying to keep as much as possible
18:29
undercover
18:31
you know so you know the left knows as
18:33
little as possible about what their
18:35
plans are and let me tell you they've
18:37
learned how to communicate with each
18:38
other really well it will be
18:41
massive that's all i can say
18:43
it will be mind-blowing to see how many
18:46
of them and i do know this along the way
18:50
which you're going to figure that anyway
18:51
more will be added but to think from if
18:54
from california to dc
18:56
you're going to see this american convoy
18:59
and this is the greatest part
19:02
other uh nationalities
19:04
in this country are also involved in
19:06
this trucking convoy it isn't just you
19:09
know we the white people in america yes
19:12
we the black people the hispanic people
19:14
you know the ones from india whoever
19:16
wherever they are that they want freedom
19:18
are already and they have had time the
19:21
american ones have had time to super
19:24
plan ahead of time the feeding stations
19:26
the places where they'll get their fuel
19:29
um they may even stop and and have bull
19:31
horns and say some stuff i know even
19:34
people are getting ready to stand along
19:36
the
19:37
is like they did in canada
19:39
and probably a line hold streets in
19:42
cities so you know they're going to show
19:44
them what they think about our fake
19:47
leadership in dc they're going to show
19:48
them what they think they're done with
19:50
it we are done with that and we know
19:52
that whole thing is crumbling even
19:54
though if they won't tell that truth one
19:56
day it will it will be told and it will
19:58
have to be told on the news there will
20:00
be no other no other
20:02
choice for them to do that
20:04
the freedom has already begun and i know
20:07
god had said watch the first three
20:09
months of this year yeah and you'll see
20:12
great things happening that will begin
20:13
to bring hope and joy not just hope but
20:16
joy into your heart so uh keep the
20:18
celebration going
20:20
and now you can visibly see things
20:22
happening that there's no way you can
20:24
hide okay you can't hide a hundred
20:26
thousand two hundred thousand people's
20:28
activities going across these different
20:30
areas in canada and in america so you
20:33
can see what has started there is now
20:36
coming down here in our country
20:38
and uh so this is this is our stand for
20:40
freedom people so make sure you're
20:42
praying for all of them pray for every
20:44
one of them protection uh of course
20:47
provision and supply it will bring hope
20:50
and joy into the hearts of everyone who
20:52
is there as it passes you know as it
20:54
passes by if they come to your city make
20:57
sure you get out there in the streets
20:58
and let them know that you're standing
21:00
with them and thank them for their for
21:02
their own stand totally totally you know
21:04
it's kind of fun but i think it was the
21:06
late 70s they had that famous song about
21:08
the trucker convoy that's when cb radios
21:11
took off and they had this famous song
21:14
and then that star goes folks i think we
21:16
got ourselves a convoy breaker breaker
21:19
one nine right or something like that
21:21
and and i heard that in canada i don't
21:23
know if they tried to shut off the
21:25
the cell phones or whatever but of
21:26
course truckers use cb radios anyway
21:29
but but other people were buying were
21:31
going out and buying cd radios so they
21:33
could communicate with the truckers
21:35
without the need
21:37
without the need for the cell phones
21:38
because you just as long as you're in
21:40
range you can talk to any of the
21:41
truckers all at the same time
21:45
back in the day when my husband's
21:47
parents lived in ohio
21:49
um my husband actually got one one of
21:51
those radios as we go up the west
21:53
virginia turnpike uh you could talk to
21:56
anybody any of the truckers if you
21:57
needed help they needed help you heard
22:00
them have conversation all the way up
22:02
day or night and so that's what he's
22:04
talking about they have their own
22:05
antennas that they operate from they
22:07
don't need to sell power they don't need
22:09
a uh they don't need a networks to be
22:11
involved right right you can't stop
22:13
those conversations people i know people
22:16
that have them in their homes and just
22:18
for fun with having to talk to all the
22:19
truckers
22:20
yeah if you got one drag it out and
22:22
clean it up
22:24
yeah to come out and say hello
22:27
as the college age which i was at that
22:29
time you would be bizarre if you didn't
22:32
have a cd radio in your car it was that
22:34
big of a deal you know and yeah you'd
22:36
learn to use it and people get on your
22:38
case if you didn't say your call signs
22:40
or your handle or whatever yes see so
22:42
they were doing that people long before
22:44
the cell phones came along yeah we
22:46
didn't have that yet people had a way to
22:48
communicate didn't they stephen now
22:49
they're going down
22:51
it was fun those were fun days so i
22:53
don't know whatever happened i guess i
22:55
sold it with the car but well let's see
22:57
i guess we'll get into some questions
22:59
about heaven and heaven related things
23:01
so for anyone that's new cat's been to
23:03
heaven uh literally thousands of times
23:06
over the last 20 30 years um is that
23:08
about right am i saying that right
23:11
it's past 20 years so you know after a
23:13
while you kind of lose count but
23:15
um yeah it has been over 20 years since
23:18
um and by the way if jesus came in
23:20
person everybody came in person and told
23:22
me uh the father and his plans about
23:25
taking me to heaven to reveal heaven to
23:27
earth like never before so you know the
23:29
truth about it he said it would dispel
23:32
the fear of death uh and that has
23:34
totally done that with so many people
23:36
but it would also let you know
23:38
for you there
23:40
and uh it is my great pleasure uh to
23:43
step out in obedience to the father i
23:45
didn't
23:46
ask and i always say this this was not
23:48
my plan and i never asked for it i just
23:50
always gave the father what he wanted i
23:52
would obey as much as i possibly could
23:54
whatever he asked me to do in the small
23:56
things so don't despise the small things
23:59
people he trained me by saying you'll
24:01
fly to this airport and and when you go
24:04
into the concourse where the food
24:06
station is you will give this person
24:07
dressed like this this message from me
24:10
and i had to just go i mean i flew uh
24:13
one time to minneapolis
24:16
to the airport there and i had this very
24:18
important message it was just grab on a
24:20
little piece of paper said i'll give you
24:21
the message when you get on the plane
24:23
this is stepping in faith okay
24:25
i did it in faith yes i paid for it out
24:27
of my own pocket
24:28
and when i got to the full court there
24:30
was the guy dressed exactly like he said
24:32
in a blue mechanic's uh outfit
24:35
and uh he said when he bows his head to
24:37
pray over his food you will run up and
24:40
say this is god's answer
24:42
and then you have to turn around and
24:43
leave wow so i wrote his answer on this
24:46
piece of paper it was about some new
24:48
invention and he was telling him yes he
24:50
was going in the right direction with it
24:51
was so profound but i didn't really
24:53
understand that uh and i had to race to
24:55
catch my plane back i flew gave the
24:57
message
24:59
so when he asks you to do things like
25:01
that that makes no sense to your natural
25:03
mind god doesn't ever have to make sense
25:06
he's god
25:07
and things he's doing right now that you
25:10
don't understand or see it might not
25:12
make sense to you but he has a reason
25:14
for doing things you just have to follow
25:17
and do what he asked so that's how he
25:18
trained me to do these things to hear
25:21
him uh exactly and distinctly and then
25:24
he would start catching me up to heaven
25:25
and showing me places and i have a
25:27
photographic memory so when i tell you
25:28
this is what i saw it's what i saw if i
25:31
told you this is what i heard it's what
25:33
i heard if i if i helped felt amazing
25:36
emotions or i smelled aromas or tasted
25:39
the food that's exactly what happened to
25:41
me so you're getting an eyewitness not
25:44
just an assumed report this is not an
25:46
assume report this is eyewitness
25:49
accounts
25:50
uh
25:51
excuse me give me get a drink yeah go
25:53
for the dream
25:56
ivanis accounts on purpose planned
25:59
by the father son and holy spirit to
26:01
reveal their home the father's house is
26:05
a world called heaven it is not just a
26:08
building and he's preparing a place for
26:11
you that you can be there with him if
26:12
you're born again believer if you don't
26:14
know jesus you better get on that train
26:17
because it's the only way there
26:20
yeah wow okay well wow wow wow cat all
26:23
right let's jump into some questions now
26:25
a lot of the questions related to heaven
26:28
or
26:29
heaven related stuff like you said pets
26:32
god takes your pets to heaven which i
26:34
love we just had to put our kitty down
26:36
last week or the week before but kat
26:39
because you had told us about that our
26:41
pets go to heaven because you had
26:43
described what happens because you had
26:44
said you're doing them a favor when
26:46
they're really sick and they're in pain
26:48
and this kitty was in terrible pain and
26:50
his kidneys shut down suddenly
26:52
you know we just knew we had done this
26:54
kitty a favor
26:55
and it's a little bit hard even so but
26:57
still you know you just ushered them
26:59
into the presence of the lord what is
27:01
the cat what is that animal's experience
27:04
i don't even know how to even ask that
27:06
question or if you would even know how
27:07
to answer it what is it what does an
27:09
animal experience when they suddenly
27:12
do you know has the lord ever showed me
27:13
anything like that what they experienced
27:15
actually uh quite a few times has
27:18
happened since
27:19
we have always had a lot of pets and
27:21
right now of course we rescue cats we
27:23
have cats everywhere yeah but um ma we
27:26
used to have yorkies um one while i was
27:29
married this is like over the last 20
27:30
years we've had yorkies my mom had one i
27:32
had one um they think they're people
27:35
they don't know their dogs
27:37
and uh and we love them very much but
27:40
eventually they get very old and you
27:42
know
27:43
i had kept mine beyond the time they had
27:47
appointed times they were supposed to
27:48
leave leave for heaven and i kept mine
27:50
and kept saying no you're going to stay
27:52
and not go
27:53
and the poor little dog got like blind
27:56
and weak and already moved
27:58
and finally my family come they said we
28:01
don't think she'll last you get back and
28:02
god said i'll let her last but you're
28:04
gonna let her go
28:07
and so uh so um i did i said well i
28:10
promise that if you let last time get
28:13
back and say goodbye then i will release
28:14
her to you and it did happen when they
28:17
when they pass
28:19
just like we do their spiritual body
28:21
that looks just like them steps out of
28:23
their fleshy body
28:26
i firmly believe that on the day the
28:28
dead in christ will rise
28:30
they will give their bodies back to you
28:32
because they are living in heaven your
28:34
own guardian angel my own guardian angel
28:37
took my yorkie to heaven and when she
28:40
stepped out of that that physical body
28:43
and she had stopped breathing there she
28:45
was
28:45
and my angel just grabbed her up and
28:48
took her up to heaven i have seen her in
28:50
heaven several times when i was there
28:52
just enjoying herself playing and games
28:55
and stuff with other pets that are up
28:57
there but they experience uh more more
29:00
so i think for them it's easy they don't
29:02
in their head have to figure out what
29:03
just happened to me they know they're
29:05
not hurt they're not sick you know
29:07
they're not and they're not infirmed
29:09
anymore they can run jump and play
29:12
because they also look younger if they
29:14
were if you're if your pet was really
29:16
well i never thought of it that way yeah
29:18
it's just like us when you could be 99
29:20
when you pass but you look like you're
29:22
in your 20s you're like 20s when you
29:24
step out of this physical body i
29:26
literally have been with people when
29:28
they passed and
29:29
i knew it was them stepping out of their
29:31
body and their angels waiting would
29:33
reach their hand out if you had loved
29:36
ones that you were with and they were
29:37
about to pass and they reached out that
29:38
was probably to take their angel's hand
29:41
that was going to be escorting them back
29:42
to heaven but the same thing with the
29:44
pets except that your own angel
29:47
takes your pet up to heaven to your
29:49
mansion that's being built and they know
29:51
that's their home now they know that's
29:52
their new home and if you had other pets
29:55
go they're gonna be with those other
29:56
pets enjoying yourself so they're happy
29:59
and i think the most amazing time
30:03
uh that i experienced all this was my
30:05
mom's little yorkie who jen and i took
30:08
he couldn't hardly move or breathe
30:10
anymore and my mom of course was like i
30:12
don't think i can take when jenna and i
30:13
go we'll take him so we took him to our
30:16
our family vet and took him in and we
30:19
stayed with him the whole time
30:21
and they gave them just a real simple
30:23
shot so he kind of went to sleep and
30:25
eventually he passed and he jumped out
30:28
of his body
30:29
yeah you could see it because you're a
30:31
seer you actually watched it happen you
30:34
actually watched it happen yes and then
30:36
and then when i saw that i
30:39
turned again and i said that the father
30:41
said run outside
30:43
and he said get your camera ready run
30:44
outside so i ran outside the vet and we
30:47
have a photograph of that dog's
30:49
spiritual body
30:51
heading towards heaven it is so him he
30:54
had the point his ears you know yorkie
30:56
you fixed the ears of the stand up he
30:57
had really high pointy ears and he was
31:00
really quite cute and it was a spiritual
31:02
body look just like him but younger and
31:04
i got pictures to come back and say look
31:07
mom he's on his way home to heaven and
31:10
she
31:10
was still rejoicing
31:12
we will be doing i'm just going to leak
31:14
it out right now don't ask us when it'll
31:16
be done we will be doing because i know
31:18
all of my stuff is going to say why'd
31:20
you do that because i'm going to give
31:21
you all hope and joy
31:23
our next calendar will be about pets
31:26
good good good
31:28
pets in heaven pets in the clouds that
31:30
we've gotten pictures of pictures of our
31:32
own pets it will make everyone rejoice
31:35
god said it'd be one of the most
31:36
favorite calendars we ever make there'll
31:38
be a little story with it but you'll see
31:41
either picture
31:42
of them in the sky literally in the
31:44
spiritual body and that that that dog's
31:46
picture will be in the calendar when we
31:49
make it so god is adamant about letting
31:52
you know your pets go to heaven so
31:55
i've already just broken the
31:57
hidden thing now that's good okay so
32:02
it's going to be so much fun making that
32:03
calendar with so many memories yeah i
32:05
want one i want one
32:09
my artist is going to do a rendering of
32:11
my dad walking along part of his ranch
32:14
with all of our pets from the time we
32:16
were growing little
32:18
walking behind him on his property that
32:20
will be one of the scenes in the
32:22
calendar so have you is that an actual
32:24
scene you've seen in him i saw in heaven
32:27
i actually saw that scene in heaven uh
32:29
uh he god caught me up to my father's
32:31
ranch my dad didn't see me or even talk
32:34
to me but i saw him i could identify the
32:37
pets i had when i was a little girl and
32:40
i tell the story when we lived in new
32:42
york we weren't allowed to have pets
32:44
where we live but they had resident mice
32:46
there
32:48
we made friends with the residents and
32:50
we taught them how to jump off the
32:52
curtain rod onto our shoulders these
32:54
little tiny mice i saw them in heaven
32:56
writing on the back of another one of
32:58
our pets that we had so
33:00
it could be a really cute story that
33:02
goes with that but that was an actual
33:04
eyewitness account i saw my brothers uh
33:06
i go on the iggy i saw my brother's
33:08
alligator you hear me talk about all the
33:10
time charlie was in this long line of
33:12
pets so
33:13
god was showing me yes i mean it when
33:15
they go to heaven so i have seen all of
33:18
these pets plus uh the couple other uh
33:20
encounters i had but but i have amazing
33:24
photographs that we took
33:26
and let me tell you every time we take
33:28
them to officemax to get printed the
33:30
people freak out because they know we
33:31
didn't generate that
33:33
i'm doing good to use my cell phone i
33:35
don't know how to make anything online
33:38
uh so i don't get to see most messages
33:41
and stuff like that and like that's why
33:43
i have tech people yeah
33:45
but none of these photographs that we
33:46
put in the calendar will be doctored up
33:48
in any way they'll be the real deal and
33:51
quite surprised and delighted so your
33:54
pets are enjoying themselves awesome
33:56
okay well along that line uh about uh
33:58
paul is asking he said we had to put my
34:00
dog down a week after my 21st birthday
34:03
since then i've been having dreams
34:05
regularly where he is with me and is not
34:08
dead is the lord
34:10
possibly allowing him to visit me
34:12
interesting question
34:14
either that or he's just catching you up
34:16
while you're sleeping
34:18
oh wow that's even better
34:20
that has actually happened many times to
34:23
people
34:24
usually within maybe the first year or
34:26
two of someone a pet passing they have
34:29
actually been caught up to certain like
34:31
there's this field they are taken to or
34:34
someplace by the crystal sea sometimes
34:36
they're walking with their with their
34:37
pet on the beach of the crystal sea
34:39
uh but a lot of them are in this
34:41
beautiful meadow there's meadows there
34:44
it's near butterfly field which is an
34:46
actual place in heaven where all the
34:47
butterflies will fly and attach
34:48
themselves and they'll sing nice
34:51
in heaven this isn't heaven i'm talking
34:53
about um but you know i don't i don't
34:55
know myself of them but i'm not saying
34:57
they couldn't appear i'm not saying i
34:59
know they can't come back and live i
35:01
just want to clarify that well i mean
35:02
even i'm not going to come back from
35:04
heaven and live with you okay
35:06
number one they wouldn't want to leave
35:08
heaven yeah
35:10
well it's even a better to me uh um it's
35:13
even a bad
35:25
that is what you're saying right
35:27
uh well you broke up when you just said
35:29
that so okay so when when he dreams that
35:32
the the animals visiting him and he's
35:34
alive and it feels real you're saying he
35:37
might be being caught up himself to
35:38
visit his animal
35:40
yes absolutely wow okay all right next
35:43
question can your grandchild's guardian
35:45
angel
35:47
and the holy spirit oh can you ask your
35:49
grandchild's guardian angel and the holy
35:52
spirit to help keep her or him in the
35:54
knowledge of what their purpose is in
35:55
life
35:56
while they're still in the womb
35:58
and as they grow up so there's i guess
36:00
there's can you ask the holy spirit and
36:03
their angel to do things like that make
36:06
them
36:07
walk the straight path i guess i don't
36:08
know
36:10
well i don't know what they mean how far
36:12
along they're growing up because
36:13
eventually everybody does have to make a
36:15
choice yeah but absolutely um i would
36:18
say like my grandchildren are being
36:20
trained by their parents my my my
36:23
children my
36:24
son-in-law my daughter
36:26
um i had three girls and they're
36:29
training them how to hear holy spirit
36:32
okay and some of them actually have seen
36:34
their guardian angels and um so they're
36:37
they're they're they're called to be in
36:39
ministry in some form or shape of
36:41
ministry or to be out there to be known
36:42
and seeing they are
36:44
and so that's something put in their
36:46
heart now god will put it in their heart
36:49
it may not be visible or known at the
36:51
time
36:52
some come out um as soon as they start
36:54
speaking they might start saying things
36:56
about god i'm just saying get ready for
36:58
these generations of children being born
37:00
now to do that more so than in the past
37:03
uh
37:03
but i'm pretty sure the angel continues
37:06
to talk to them that's why they're here
37:08
the guardian angel will try to influence
37:10
them to do what's right and not wrong
37:12
or to to ask for forgiveness i mean uh
37:15
that's what your guardian angel is there
37:17
they're garden protect your soul
37:19
as well as them and so i'm quite sure
37:22
that they've been given guidelines by
37:24
god when they're sent at the time of
37:26
conception
37:27
that is when your guardian angels are
37:29
sent
37:30
so life begins at conception people i
37:34
know the angels show up and they'll be
37:36
waiting outside the mother for that baby
37:38
to be born so they can start speaking
37:40
things of god they sing to the babies
37:42
you can't hear them and that's many
37:45
times a little baby is looking all over
37:47
the room they're seeing the angels
37:49
whenever mine they bring mine here and
37:52
where i live to visit me they're always
37:55
looking at the angels and of course i
37:57
see their angels with them so they're
38:00
not going to leave those those children
38:01
but in the womb you have to understand
38:05
if anything was spoken by the father
38:06
holy spirit it would be planted in their
38:08
spirit somewhere because they are little
38:10
babies and even jesus as inside the womb
38:14
of mary had to grow and begin to learn
38:17
now he learned the normal things to
38:19
learn even as a little child but at one
38:22
point he knew he was the son of god
38:24
all know the story about the caravan
38:27
where he came of age and he in the
38:29
father then revealed himself and he knew
38:32
that he was about the father's business
38:34
that would be his father in heaven and
38:36
and from that moment on he was different
38:38
but up until then i think he probably
38:40
had to learn like we did instead he
38:42
faced every every kind of temptation or
38:45
trial or whatever that we ourselves have
38:48
had to face in our lives so even growing
38:50
up he had to learn how to be nice kind
38:52
polite i'm quite sure that joseph taught
38:54
him a lot of those things himself you
38:57
know the normal natural things but as
38:59
far as god imparting and speaking that
39:01
happens even when children are young my
39:04
children heard at a very early age at
39:07
three one of them started being caught
39:08
up in heaven and shown things
39:10
and uh they god still speaks to this one
39:13
grandchild he speaks a lot to the other
39:15
one so
39:16
if you're praying for them to know jesus
39:18
christ and not mr destiny that's very
39:22
important but make sure when you speak
39:23
to them yourself
39:25
don't be harsh i just have to say this
39:28
is the truth
39:29
don't yell don't yell and holler out in
39:31
your house when your baby's born you try
39:33
to keep an atmosphere of peace and joy
39:36
as much as you can
39:37
you don't want to cause distractions
39:41
in the soul or even in the natural
39:42
nature of that baby you know babies when
39:44
they're sung to when they're loved they
39:46
just grow up differently themselves and
39:48
ones who are in a household where people
39:49
are always fighting and screaming
39:51
so if at all possible
39:54
and i will tell people all the time
39:56
don't you feel like you gotta fight go
39:58
outside pray first before you talk to
40:00
each other i'm talking to the husband
40:01
and wife you pray loose all of the
40:03
wounds ask for grace from god and then
40:06
have a conversation with them because
40:09
you don't want to impart um
40:11
uh a feelings or things into your little
40:14
child growing up
40:16
that's why kids usually get into crime
40:18
their parents were either in crime or
40:20
they didn't treat them very well but god
40:22
is adamantly told me to make sure that
40:24
i'm saying to all the ones who are
40:26
related to me make sure that you have
40:29
peace in your household that when you
40:30
talk to your children you can still
40:32
correct them but don't scream and yell
40:34
and make them feel degraded it is not
40:37
good for that child if my mom was
40:39
sitting next to me she'd be sitting
40:41
right here uh uh nodding her head yeah
40:45
so it is important the atmosphere you
40:47
create and i know sometimes there's a
40:49
situation where you're not married to
40:50
someone who's nice at all make sure you
40:52
have time for that child to encourage
40:54
them and i will say this and this is
40:57
true
40:57
you as a watcher over their soul because
41:00
that's who you are you're raising a soul
41:02
in the kingdom
41:04
adam was called a living soul because
41:06
that's your whole inside that's what you
41:07
think you choose then your emotions are
41:09
displayed if they have seen or witnessed
41:12
something when the other person leaves
41:15
you lay your hand on their head and say
41:16
as a watcher over their soul i choose
41:19
with my will to lose all of the trauma
41:21
of the harsh words the profanity uh
41:25
anything that would hurt my child
41:27
someone anyway i loose it in jesus name
41:29
and guess what jesus will come and take
41:31
all that stuff out of that child i tell
41:34
people if you adopt kids who are in very
41:36
abusive situations you really need to do
41:39
that lay your hand on their head and say
41:40
as a watcher of their soul i choose my
41:42
will to lose trauma abuse that happened
41:45
even in the past harsh unkind words you
41:48
know any words the enemy loose it out of
41:50
their soul and jesus will come pull it
41:53
out and then it can't affect their
41:54
future and confine the love and the life
41:57
of god to them
41:58
in the past we didn't know all this we
42:00
knew of course that we would pray this
42:02
is a very high level of prayer
42:05
to declare a decree but you're really
42:07
using the keys to the kingdom that i
42:10
give you the keys to the kingdom okay
42:12
and it's about binding and losing
42:17
if somebody bullied your kid at school
42:18
whatever you do when they come home lay
42:20
your hand in their head said i choose my
42:22
will to lose all the bullying the
42:24
meanness any hate uh any abuse out of my
42:28
child's soul and i've had testimonies
42:30
from parents that did that and it was
42:32
like it never happened wow
42:35
wow cat okay let me ask you this
42:37
question you talked about um
42:39
uh wasn't what wasn't the question but i
42:41
really wanted to key in on this because
42:43
you said you talked about jesus learning
42:45
as a child he had to learn there's a
42:47
scripture in king james that says he and
42:49
he learned obedience by the things he
42:51
suffered and i always said that was an
42:53
odd scripture that jesus learned
42:55
obedience by the things he suffered is
42:57
there any more detail you can
42:59
uh yeah
43:01
he learned he learned obedience because
43:03
there were consequences
43:05
yeah i'm sure if he said something sharp
43:07
or harsh himself while he was growing up
43:10
uh that he got corrected i'm sure that
43:13
uh even god has given given a dynamics
43:16
of how to raise a child and that is with
43:19
affection
43:20
um correction and direction and i'm sure
43:23
you need all three of those when you're
43:24
raising up children i'm sure joseph and
43:27
mary both employed that
43:29
with jesus especially mary knowing that
43:32
he had a powerful call on his life and
43:35
so he learned that there would be
43:36
consequences i'm not saying when he was
43:38
older and he already knew that he
43:39
belonged to the father but i'm saying
43:41
before that time you know if he did
43:43
something he shouldn't have done
43:44
something i'm quite sure that mary and
43:46
joseph both had consequences for him and
43:49
he did so in other words the things he
43:51
went through and learned there's going
43:53
to be consequences
43:54
and he did grow and also there's a
43:56
scripture that i love
43:58
as he walked in obedience to his parents
44:00
and honored his parents and i promise
44:02
you he just jesus honored joseph as the
44:05
one who raised him and mary as you know
44:08
his mother he honored them and there's
44:10
promises but in luke 2 52
44:14
this is my favorite scripture and jesus
44:17
because they've been walking in
44:18
obedience and learning how to live jesus
44:22
increase
44:23
in wisdom and stature and favor with god
44:28
and man that's good
44:30
so that is what will result in your own
44:33
child when you raise them with
44:35
consequences you know and you have those
44:37
three things affection direction or
44:40
affection correction and direction uh
44:43
then that will be the result that your
44:44
child will increase in wisdom that's
44:47
understanding right knowing and stature
44:50
that means his integrity uh his personal
44:53
character
44:55
and favor
44:57
now you have to see because of his
44:58
obedience he got favor
45:00
not just with god but with man so 252
45:03
you should write that down and remember
45:05
that when you're declaring over your
45:07
child and and cat on this
45:10
you know the scripture is very cl plain
45:12
that he uh clear that
45:14
that he he was attempted in all points
45:17
and yet without sin
45:18
is it possible that before he became
45:21
that 12 year old or 13 year old boy he
45:23
did sin in the sense of he had to be
45:26
corrected with something or how do you
45:28
explain that
45:29
steve
45:32
you don't always get corrupted for sin
45:34
okay
45:35
uh
45:36
they did they made a not a good decision
45:38
that wasn't necessarily sin right okay
45:40
sin is rejecting we know the basic of
45:43
basis of sin is rejecting jesus christ
45:46
and then you get into areas where you
45:48
you
45:49
there's a there's an age of
45:50
accountability
45:52
nobody knows that age god
45:54
from that point on you have grace and
45:58
you can have correction from your
45:59
parents
46:00
um to go in the right direction
46:03
but maybe it was something that was
46:04
didn't please his parents or maybe he
46:06
shouldn't have done that didn't make it
46:07
a sin
46:08
so there's a difference in the sin and
46:10
not making good decisions that's good so
46:13
i think the consequences jesus faced as
46:15
growing up would be not good decisions
46:18
okay i don't think he outright sin
46:20
because he said without sin right yeah
46:22
he faced it all even as an adult but he
46:25
didn't sin so we weren't talking about
46:30
when you got corrected you know when you
46:31
make wrong decisions that's how you
46:33
learn not to get into sin later that's
46:35
really good remember how to stay on the
46:37
right path when you walk in obedience
46:39
and honor to those who are over you you
46:41
know uh then you already learn how to
46:44
walk on that path and then you yourself
46:46
can have integrity like luke 252 so i'm
46:49
not ever saying he outright sin because
46:52
it didn't live without it but being
46:55
young and immature you know
46:58
we do make mistakes and our parents have
47:00
to drag us back in line and and give us
47:03
correction and direction that's the most
47:05
important part the direction
47:06
um but don't forget affection that's
47:09
good that's the best explanation i've
47:11
heard on that uh totally that's totally
47:13
totally yeah i know a lot of people that
47:16
was totally from the father affection uh
47:18
correction and direction you can't leave
47:20
one of them out you will not have a full
47:22
rounded child if you do nothing to give
47:25
direction all the time and correction
47:27
they're not going to know how to love
47:29
that you're leaving the love out but you
47:30
can't just have affection and direction
47:32
and not have corruption they'll think
47:35
that you that that the world owes them
47:37
everything
47:38
and they won't consider other people and
47:40
you can't even just have affection and
47:42
correction and not direction they won't
47:43
even know what to do and i've seen some
47:46
kids raised that way they couldn't make
47:47
decisions on how to save how to look for
47:49
a job so you need all three the father
47:52
gave this he said this guess what this
47:54
is how the father operates with us
47:56
affection
47:57
correction
47:59
and direction nice yeah
48:01
good okay now let me ask a question you
48:03
i know you and manuel
48:05
johnson each tell many stories about or
48:07
several stories where god has taken you
48:10
to the future not showing you the future
48:12
taking you there
48:14
and then he's also taking you back in
48:16
time and you didn't you weren't shown
48:18
that you were actually there bobby
48:19
connor talks about being at the
48:21
crucifixion he was there it was he was
48:24
there so that's in my head and then this
48:27
question comes from wendy
48:30
which is interesting about time she says
48:32
does the anointing work backwards in
48:34
time for instance if i release the
48:36
anointing
48:37
into a doorknob and i pray that
48:39
that it touches everybody who has
48:41
touched the knob
48:43
in the past and future
48:45
would that work that's an interesting
48:46
question so they're they're wanting to
48:48
pray backwards in time
48:51
well i'm not quite sure that would work
48:53
yeah that's an interesting one
48:55
i know i have
48:56
many conversations
48:58
about going back and changing everything
49:00
in time i i have to say personally the
49:04
father has never told me that was
49:06
possible
49:07
the only thing i know about something
49:09
like that ever happening in in probably
49:12
rarely that somebody was sent back
49:15
that i don't do this i don't do that
49:17
don't ask me to do it because they
49:18
hadn't decided to go back and rescue
49:20
somebody really would have died so
49:22
they'll be here in this time i have
49:25
never ever and i don't see anywhere in
49:27
the bible that says you can go back and
49:29
change everything so uh somebody would
49:31
never live well i know people who want
49:33
they want to go back in time and wipe
49:35
out hitler uh so none of that stuff
49:37
would happen but i have to tell you
49:39
there are things on timelines that are
49:41
going to happen how we deal with them
49:44
and how we respond to them in that time
49:48
is really what matters i do not think
49:51
you can choose on your own i'm going to
49:52
go back in this time and wipe out
49:54
somebody so none of that would happen
49:56
sometimes there are certain people sent
49:59
that that are birthed through or because
50:02
of these people that then later become
50:04
great people and you would have wiped
50:06
out all of that you can't see it as i'm
50:08
going to fix this one thing you moving
50:11
somebody off the earth that never
50:12
existed and never wouldn't their
50:14
genealogy would be gone and yet great
50:17
people came out of some people who
50:18
weren't good
50:20
so you are not going to change this
50:22
whole world right now to be perfect this
50:24
is not heaven one day it will be perfect
50:27
and and there's some people who try
50:29
their whole life to do this um you can't
50:31
really pray over people who are in the
50:34
past right they're not there anymore
50:37
they're not here anymore and i think
50:39
people get really focused on that it
50:42
could even be a distraction i'm not
50:43
saying what you're wanting is not a good
50:45
thing i'm just saying it's not going to
50:48
happen yeah
50:49
he shows me things to have true
50:51
revelation on how those things happen or
50:54
what really took place like in the
50:56
spirit realm back in that time and
50:58
things like that but but i know people
51:00
personally who want to go back
51:03
in other words you can't say well i wish
51:05
i'd met this person years ago i'll go
51:08
back in time and make it happen then it
51:09
only met them and not the others
51:12
you you're not gonna do that okay you're
51:14
not god number one you aren't changing
51:17
god's timeline of what is going to
51:20
happen
51:21
and so i would encourage you pray for
51:23
what's going on right now you can pray
51:25
into the future though you can make a
51:27
stand for you and your family line up to
51:30
a thousand generations you can declare
51:32
over them and that will make a
51:34
difference of those coming in the future
51:38
your life should be focused on future
51:40
current and future that's good because
51:42
you are not going to change the path now
51:46
kat let me tell you a really short
51:47
version of something that talks right
51:49
into the future it was a bizarre
51:51
incident about god had
51:54
me encount
51:55
encountered like 15 years ago he took me
51:57
to a jewish cemetery in in queens new
52:00
york okay and what there's this bizarre
52:02
it's too hard to explain why i ended up
52:05
there i saw these two people that then
52:06
disappeared i'm convinced they were
52:08
angels they told me where the entrance
52:10
is the largest jewish cemetery in this
52:13
part of
52:14
new york i ended up in this jewish
52:16
cemetery and i was looking for a place
52:18
to hide and pray okay
52:20
i found only one spot in the entire
52:22
cemetery is like this horse shoot in i
52:24
thought why am i here lord i have no
52:26
idea i got on my knees nobody could see
52:28
me that's why i chose that spot god
52:31
didn't say go here i was just trying to
52:33
hide yeah and i and and so i thought i
52:35
got nothing to pray i started thinking
52:37
looking at the headstone thinking well
52:39
may you know that scripture about
52:41
ezekiel prays for the bones to come
52:43
alive and i was going through my head
52:45
and i said well i don't know about that
52:46
but i'm gonna pray and the name on the
52:49
headstone was finkelstein or finkelstein
52:51
however he said and so i said lord i
52:53
pray for every
52:55
living relative of finkelstein from
52:58
these finkelsteins to be blessed blah
53:00
blah i prayed something like that just
53:02
like that i wrote this up on the elijah
53:05
list and this guy wrote to me from
53:07
germany he said steve hold on to your
53:09
hat
53:10
while you were doing that we had a
53:12
special guest from israel whose last
53:14
name was finkelstein and she said i will
53:17
never go to germany not after they did
53:19
this to my people and during that time
53:22
you were praying
53:23
she was weeping because of all the
53:26
healing that was taking place now that's
53:28
praying it forward right yes it is yes
53:32
that amazing isn't that amazing yes and
53:34
i'm sure that um god did put that on
53:37
your heart to pray that specific prayer
53:39
at that very time yeah
53:41
even though you didn't hear him say to
53:43
go there i'm sure your angel was
53:44
impressing you even though you couldn't
53:46
see him that was something god needed
53:48
spoken he needed it released and spoken
53:51
in the earth and you did it when things
53:53
line up with god's timing it is the most
53:56
amazing significant thing
53:59
you will experience in your life when
54:00
that happens but just that one little
54:02
act of doing that
54:04
uh not even understanding it because
54:07
look at look at what that reached that
54:08
was powerful yeah it was powerful
54:10
awesome awesome okay
54:12
um
54:15
i want to make sure
54:16
cat have you seen jesus seated at the
54:19
right hand of the father
54:21
on his throne or does he share a throne
54:24
i've always wondered
54:25
that's a confusing scripture does he sit
54:27
on the same
54:28
sea or does he share a throne because
54:30
he's seated beside the father
54:32
then he seated with the father so what
54:34
is it
54:35
i think it's whatever they want at the
54:37
time i have seen both i've seen christ
54:39
on a throne by himself i have seen him
54:42
many times sitting in his father's
54:44
throne right next to him i have seen
54:46
that happen
54:48
i think also significantly to let people
54:51
know is there is one general
54:54
massive throne room i call it the
54:56
general throne room because there's more
54:57
than one throne room there's the
54:59
commissioning throne room there's the
55:01
throne room that's connected to the
55:03
courtroom
55:04
there's another a courtroom where people
55:07
are given in the spirit weapons to pray
55:09
with
55:10
there's more than one i think the
55:11
commissioning throne room is in our
55:13
calendar when we did the one
55:16
the most recent one we did for 2021 it
55:18
has a picture of the father on the
55:19
commissioning throne room and that's the
55:22
one that has the horns before the altar
55:24
and he actually puts mantles on people
55:27
and when he's going to give you a new
55:29
mantle your layer of you that looks just
55:32
like you you yourself are seated and
55:34
have any places in heaven if you people
55:36
caught up there you might see yourself
55:37
sitting on the throne that would be a
55:38
spiritual image of you is called into
55:41
the commissioning throne room he
55:42
literally puts a mantle on you when you
55:44
hold on the horns of the altar and he's
55:46
decreeing things over you
55:48
at that time in your life there could be
55:50
someone praying those very things over
55:52
you or you felt something come over you
55:54
something and then the holy spirit began
55:56
to speak to you but the general throne
55:58
room is the one mentioned in the book of
55:59
revelations
56:01
revelations 4 what sau where john is
56:04
caught up and sees the father
56:06
with the with the rainbow coming in and
56:08
out of him is very clear uh he doesn't
56:11
see jesus at that point but he sees the
56:13
father on his throne and and the
56:15
rainbow's moving in and out of him
56:17
and even when um they i think it was uh
56:20
was it ezekiel that saw the throne
56:22
moving being moved yeah the wheels and
56:25
the wheels the wheels within wheels yes
56:27
that's the spirit of the living creature
56:29
that comes out it looks like a gyroscope
56:32
it's more like this it's not like a
56:34
wheel within just a wheel it's not like
56:35
that it's like something that would move
56:37
i've seen that but so there's many
56:40
different
56:41
places in the bible it talks about the
56:42
throne but i totally have seen him
56:45
sitting right next to his father then
56:47
again i've seen times when i saw jesus
56:50
just on a throne and you know if you
56:52
don't know he also has his own mansion
56:55
in heaven jesus has a mansion the father
56:58
has a personal place that is his in
57:00
heaven also
57:01
it's not like the throne is vacated
57:03
usually one or the other are in there
57:06
especially if someone's coming home to
57:07
heaven they will both be in that throne
57:09
room but i've seen him sitting right
57:11
next to the father or something does
57:12
everyone come home to the throne room is
57:15
that what you're saying you have to
57:17
okay okay
57:18
because i'm always picturing showing up
57:20
at the gate somewhere you know always
57:22
the jokes about saint peter wait i don't
57:24
really mean saint peter but but
57:27
but
57:28
he meets you at the gate yeah some sort
57:30
of gate thing or something there is a
57:32
huge gate the one with the portals is a
57:34
massive gate but but there is a
57:37
disembarking place like we have airports
57:39
where you a certain place you don't land
57:41
in anybody's yard there's a place when
57:43
you arrive somewhere that you come to
57:45
whether it's a train depot or something
57:47
like that there's a there's a depot when
57:50
you're caught up whether you're in any
57:51
kind of a transport or really and a
57:54
chariot up to heaven the first place you
57:56
will always come to is this depot in
57:59
heaven which is gorgeous you see the
58:00
river of life you see the gates a little
58:02
way off and a lot of family members or
58:05
pets are waiting for you there
58:07
like i saw oral roberts when he came
58:08
home the masses were out there to
58:10
welcome him
58:12
and um so you're you're there and then
58:14
jesus many times will greet you finally
58:17
escort you into the throne room he's the
58:20
one who walks you back up the throne to
58:22
the father it says he is the door
58:25
it says jesus is the only way back to
58:27
the father so jesus himself eventually
58:30
no matter who comes up in heaven he will
58:31
come get them and walk them up the steps
58:33
to the throne and say look father here's
58:35
your son here's your daughter they've
58:37
come home wow individually everybody
58:40
gets that individually individually very
58:44
cool very cool i don't think i ever
58:46
understood that wow
58:47
i love this stuff all right um
58:51
the bible describes the four creatures
58:53
oh you just talked about that in ezekiel
58:56
and revelation as being covered in eyes
58:58
why eyes
59:00
and their question is what do eyes
59:01
represent i don't know if it represents
59:03
something it is something right it's a
59:05
it's useful eyes right they're doing
59:08
something right there
59:09
[Laughter]
59:12
yeah you know
59:14
they're not just there for good looks
59:16
right
59:17
no that they help
59:19
why do you have eyes to use something
59:20
yeah to see right because she says what
59:22
do they represent and i'm thinking
59:24
they're not representing right they're
59:26
actually doing
59:27
those wheels when the
59:29
the wheels with them within the wheels
59:32
it is the spirit of the living creatures
59:34
that talks about it on the throne
59:36
it that part of them comes out and it
59:38
navigates
59:40
they didn't lose their eyes in their
59:41
head they didn't lose their eyes all
59:43
over their body they have thousands of
59:45
eyes in their wings these are the living
59:47
creatures and it talks about this it
59:49
says it says in the bible that that that
59:51
wheel in the wheel of the spirit living
59:53
creature it's gonna move the throne it
59:55
comes out it's gonna navigate it's gonna
59:57
move it it has to see where it's taking
60:00
the throne so these eyes are living
60:03
they're not pictures of eyes they're not
60:04
just paintings of eyes these are living
60:07
eyes that are in these wheels within the
60:09
wheel and i may get something like that
60:11
to represent that and they literally
60:13
they catch them and they navigate the
60:15
throne wherever it goes in heaven or
60:17
wherever now the living creatures are
60:19
there but that wheel within the wheel
60:21
that's their spirit that's part the
60:22
navigation throne so it has to see
60:25
whatever has eyes in heaven is alive
60:28
yeah
60:29
it's just a being it's a spirit or it is
60:33
like one of the hosts or something like
60:34
that
60:36
okay wow
60:37
live okay now here's a question about
60:40
they want to know about does the spirit
60:42
does the holy spirit have a sense of
60:44
humor
60:45
does he say funny quips or she actually
60:48
said funny jokes but i'm i don't know
60:51
yeah so tell me
60:52
yes yeah between between father son and
60:55
holy spirit holy spirit is the drama
60:57
king
60:58
that is his nickname in heaven
61:01
he is a very funny he's very focused
61:04
very serious he loves to put on a show
61:08
and i don't know what else you would
61:09
call it back in the days when the holy
61:11
spirit was falling on people everywhere
61:14
speaking in tongues is quite a show if
61:16
you've never seen or heard it it's very
61:18
powerful it is the holy spirit speaking
61:20
through the mouth of these the of the
61:22
people that invite him to indwell them
61:24
he moves into so think you get jesus
61:28
right you get holy spirit you already
61:29
got a show going on the inside of you
61:31
holy spirit loves drama he loves um he
61:34
loves movies he loves he loves
61:37
theatrical stuff
61:38
good
61:40
decent exciting powerful stuff because
61:43
some people have this picture of how it
61:45
is on earth it's not always good to talk
61:46
about those things no holy spirit does
61:49
have the greatest sense of humor of all
61:51
three of them oh wow and he is the one
61:54
who gives me the one liners to say to
61:56
people when they don't want to hear them
61:58
or when they love it and they hear it
62:00
it's always him that gives it to me and
62:02
if i'm talking about something he will
62:04
say to me talk about this
62:06
like right now just stop and talk about
62:08
this that's him
62:10
uh so he totally will get involved in
62:12
your life he does give you direction it
62:14
says so uh sometimes it's direction
62:16
because you need to know sometimes it's
62:18
because he wants you to
62:21
so he's just he's the pageantry guy he's
62:23
the funny man he's the he loves
62:27
pageantry he's the life of the party guy
62:29
huh
62:30

62:35
celebrations uh and he loves sweets he
62:39
just does and he loves flowers and
62:42
he loves to dance and he dances with
62:44
everybody in the throne sometimes these
62:46
mass big dances they have and that may
62:48
not be in your mind your mind is what in
62:50
the world are we going to do besides
62:52
bowing before the throne of god
62:54
i'm telling you they would be bored
62:56

62:58

63:05
victory come they love victory in your
63:08
life
63:09
and they celebrate and rejoice it says
63:11
they celebrate over one person just one
63:13
person coming home to heaven there you
63:15
go out the one person
63:16
uh they they love
63:19
life
63:20
and they actually live life in heaven
63:23
there's no oppression there's no doom
63:24
and gloom there's no threats there's no
63:27
fear there's no rejection there's none
63:29
of that there there's life and living
63:32
life at its fullest and that's why he
63:34
gives us what he gives us grace
63:37
for abundant life
63:40
that's an abundance you have to have joy
63:42
you have to have celebration um
63:44
everybody wants to you know make sure
63:46
things are taken care of and we should
63:48
we should make sure you know that we're
63:50
being uh having integrity with with
63:52
money and if you think i'm misspending
63:54
money i will just give you this
63:56
if he sends it
63:58
he spends it oh that's a good one any
64:01
money it's where god wants it spent and
64:03
how he wants it spent maybe you should
64:06
start saying that god i would love to
64:08
have this much money if you send it i'll
64:10
let you spend it and then he will
64:11
influence you to make sure it's okay for
64:14
you to have money it's okay
64:17
to have good things uh god wants us to
64:19
be blessed but remember other people who
64:21
don't remember if you say if you get a
64:23
bunch of money say god is there
64:24
somewhere you want me to spend some of
64:25
this money
64:26
i promise you he's going to tell you but
64:28
that is my motto no matter what i end up
64:31
by having if he sends that money and he
64:34
does through many sources he is going to
64:37
have the right to spend that money
64:38
that's good you know i love that line
64:40
too
64:41
i had not heard you talk about bars in
64:43
heaven but this relinda says can you
64:46
talk about the bars you saw in heaven i
64:48
guess they mean is there some sort of a
64:52
starbucks place or what what what have
64:54
you told people i don't remember that
64:56
one well i think they may be talking
64:57
about the kind of cell alcohol
65:00
i don't know and they can't be talking
65:01
about alcohol unless it's spiritual
65:04
alcohol
65:05
yes i will tell you the only a neighbor
65:08
i can't even say this yeah that's an
65:09
inebriated inebriated in heaven is from
65:12
the holy spirit yeah his presence just
65:15
causes that to happen you laugh out loud
65:18
i mean you fall on the road the streets
65:20
of gold sometimes laughing out loud
65:22
because of the prince of the holy spirit
65:24
the only wine they have in heaven it
65:27
does not have alcohol
65:29
alcohol
65:30
this may be a crusher just loose it from
65:32
your soul no beer no hard liquor no
65:35
there's not in heaven nothing cages
65:38
nothing ferments it's not going to
65:39
happen but you will have holy spirit
65:42
wine to drink and let me tell you you'll
65:44
never have a hangover from i've never
65:47
drank i've never experienced that and
65:48
don't want to have no desire for it i'm
65:51
actually very much against alcohol don't
65:53
offer me a drink you will get a message
65:56
okay i'm just going to save it for free
65:57
yeah people excuse me of drinking
65:59
they're lying out right because i
66:01
despise that my dad used to rescue
66:04
surviving alcoholics and i saw what it
66:06
did so let's go back to heaven
66:08
there are places you can go into
66:11
that people are playing music and the
66:13
joy of the lord and uh people who do
66:16
guitar and stuff like that um not elvis
66:18
doesn't do that but elvis does play in
66:20
his own room many times himself wow yes
66:23
there's they're more it's more like i
66:25
guess what what are they called pubs i
66:27
guess it's more like a pub place you
66:29
could eat food delicious food you can
66:31
have wine from heaven if you want to and
66:34
then you come out and you fall off your
66:36
stool and they drag you out and laugh in
66:37
the streets
66:39
that kind of thing happens but it isn't
66:41
tied to darkness or evil you're not
66:43
going to be drunk god talks against
66:46
drunkards and you know he says strong
66:50
drink is a mocker is going to mock you
66:53
with your life so you shouldn't go there
66:56
right you should go there
66:58
and the the the wine that they talk
67:00
about in the bible biblical wine was i
67:02
think three percent alcohol people uh i
67:05
would very not even very good to pour it
67:07
on a wound but when you hear about
67:09
celebrations
67:11
most jews drank um
67:14
that's the wine they drink is three
67:16
percent alcohol it's not 25 or 100 proof
67:18
you know 100
67:20
100 proof of holy spirit maybe yeah but
67:22
but in one way she is kind of right
67:25
there are places to go you meet with
67:27
your friends you laugh and talk and
67:29
celebrate together
67:31
but only the holy spirit's presence they
67:33
have vineyards in heaven everybody can
67:35
jump in the baths and mash the grapes
67:37
they put them in these huge vests i've
67:39
been there and then holy spirit
67:41
literally will invade every single vat
67:44
nice nice in these vineyards so when you
67:47
drink it you're getting filled with him
67:49
not
67:50
with jesus
67:52
there are things like now i'm not a
67:53
coffee drinker but most of the earth
67:56
loves
67:57
all the different varieties of coffee
67:59
and frappuccinos
68:00
that's about the coffee steve yeah so
68:02
are there these places with all kinds of
68:04
coffees
68:05
yes
68:06
there are and there are people who grow
68:09

talking for hours it seems like right
71:07
and so if they're talking for hours
71:09
is the entire conversation about the
71:12
lord or are they talking about this
71:14
family member and that activity what
71:16
what what would you have you heard
71:18
conversations it's like most of my
71:21
conversations
71:23
i had two in the department store
71:25
yesterday i just started because of my
71:27
hair of course i got to share heaven
71:29
what's going on i mean they get the
71:30
whole thing and oh i love your pink hair
71:32
what's that or they'll say where are you
71:34
from and i'll go heaven
71:36
i have a heaven conversation in the
71:38
department store uh i do talk about
71:40
other things sometimes like i love
71:42
horses you know i did so people in
71:44
heaven depending on what encounters
71:46
they're having you can have encounters
71:48
in heaven with jesus really okay person
71:50
to person you can have one with the
71:51
father they talk a lot about that but
71:53
they do talk about family they do talk
71:55
about friends people go on tours all
71:58
over heaven maybe they just got to go to
72:01
the valley of the falls you know see
72:02
these 200 foot waterfalls or dive down
72:04
in them maybe they got to go to the
72:06
mountain of spices and see fall leaves
72:08
this big that never dropped their colors
72:10
wow
72:11
and they're all in these places
72:14
talking about their experiences they
72:16
just had and how amazing and then they
72:18
go oh what have you been here have you
72:20
seen this isn't god good to us don't you
72:23
love having us beyond anything yes they
72:25
have conversations like that that's good
72:28
now do they do do they have
72:29
conversations
72:31
you know i've asked you this in
72:32
different ways over the years
72:35
about reminiscing do they reminisce
72:37
about how our children came to the lord
72:40
or is that so old news that it's all
72:43
current my family over here is doing
72:45
this and my daughter over there has a
72:47
coffee shop and my son over there has a
72:50
uh old car
72:52
model t shop what what what did they
72:55
talk about family yeah
72:57
i think they do both okay i think they
73:01
they don't have their memory their whole
73:03
memory is not taken away i think your
73:05
memories of really tragic traumas you
73:08
don't talk about them in heaven at all
73:10
but certainly fun times you have with
73:11
your family when
73:13
they and their child could be sitting
73:15
next to them now you're still going home
73:17
as your father son and daughter but you
73:20
still remember your family members you
73:21
live near them you go on trips together
73:23
so yeah you can talk about fun things
73:25
that you did on the earth sometimes
73:27
uh real important ones was how they got
73:29
born
73:30
again okay yeah and the other thing you
73:33
talk about is you're taken to a theater
73:35
when you go to heaven that shows your
73:37
whole life relived with all of the sins
73:40
and the and the evil and harsh things
73:43
that happen removed and you will see
73:45
every time your angel intervened saved
73:48
your life how holy spirit influenced you
73:51
what was going on in heaven when you did
73:54
certain things on the years and the
73:55
prayers how they changed your life you
73:58
see all that the first thing you want to
73:59
do
74:00
is go to the coffee shop next to this
74:02
place and talk to all your friends about
74:04
that
74:06
how your angel intervened and because
74:08
your friends go sometimes to watch your
74:10
life we live you know i my my you know
74:13
i've told many many times on this
74:14
program i have a very very abusive
74:16
father he's with the lord now he's been
74:18
with me he loves you oh awesome and i
74:20
love him and he's been there about 30
74:22
years but but the life of my life
74:25
especially as a child let's say my up to
74:27
my teenage years or yeah or young adults
74:29
was was the word the abuse so how does
74:32
he so does he replay my childhood
74:35
showing me
74:36
this momentary good thing with my father
74:38
this momentary good thing
74:40
so i would end up with memories only of
74:43
the good things he ever did
74:44
yes
74:46
yeah
74:46
because in you um in anyone in heaven
74:50
there's no sorrow
74:52
there's no fears
74:54
there's no regrets even you don't even
74:56
have regrets it's gone it's not part of
74:59
your and you have to remember you're in
75:01
your spiritual body right your soul is
75:04
with you your soul does not sleep your
75:05
body sleeps in the earth your body
75:08
sleeps but your soul with all the memory
75:10
banks that has in it even if you
75:12
approach to something there would be no
75:15
wounding you can't be re-wounded in
75:17
heaven it's not going to be trauma again
75:20
but but most people don't even think
75:22
about that they're so thrilled and
75:23
amazed that they're there they think
75:24
about the goodness of god they will
75:26
usually talk about the good memories and
75:28
the good things that happen even the
75:30
movie is not like a solid movie it
75:32
sometimes leaves out years of your life
75:34
on purpose you're not going to expose
75:37
these theaters are not to expose every
75:38
wicked evil thing that you did is it's
75:40
about the grace and the goodness of god
75:43
and how he influenced you your angels
75:45
influenced you how they saved your life
75:47
how they brought you up spiritually
75:50
together with other people that you were
75:52
involved in ministry or stuff the good
75:54
stuff it's the good stuff that you get
75:55
to see so that you come out so filled
75:58
with life and gratitude for god now
76:00
people give testimonies in heaven uh
76:02
someone new comes home everybody wants
76:04
to go hear them um
76:06
talk about their life on the earth
76:08
they're always always going to talk
76:10
about the power of god the goodness of
76:12
god his mercies to them and so people
76:15
when somebody comes home i they're all
76:16
probably still trying to hear uh
76:18
halftime is here or robert speak or
76:20
billy joe daughtry or
76:22
smith wigglesworth the people want to
76:24
get to know
76:26
but mainly if somebody new comes they
76:28
all have certain events where they can
76:30
go and speak in people or you can invite
76:32
them to speak to your own friends and
76:33
stuff in heaven so everybody wants to
76:35
know what did you think
76:37
when you first stepped out of your body
76:40
well they do they do talk about that
76:42
okay they do how did you feel when you
76:45
knew you were gone right your body was
76:47
lifeless you turned around you don't
76:48
know you're dead sometimes steve because
76:50
you feel you're as a spiritual being you
76:53
will be able to feel your body you can
76:55
pass through this these natural walls
76:57
but but there's a spirit realm
76:58
everywhere where your spiritual body
77:00
when it steps out it's alive filled with
77:02
the life of god the joy here you for the
77:05
first time seeing your guardian angels
77:07
or jesus has come in his own chariot to
77:09
pick you up but you're like
77:10
oh you are so undone and excited and
77:14
waves of joy begin to feel you fled over
77:17
you so everybody wants to hear
77:19
how did you feel when that happened oh
77:22
wow i didn't know that happened that was
77:24
really good good to hear wow thinking of
77:27
my mom who's very close
77:29
and uh
77:30
to see that happen to her
77:33
to know that it's not to see it because
77:35
i'm not a seer but and you do see you've
77:37
been uh at the bedside of more than one
77:40
person who passed
77:41
you watch them step out don't you i did
77:44
i did uh my husband's best friend
77:47
who was a native american indian we
77:50
called him chief that was his nickname
77:52
uh he decided to stay in florida instead
77:54
of go back to the reservation when he
77:56
got out of the marines they were in the
77:57
marines together he was somebody who
77:59
laughed he was such a great person he
78:01
laughed everything he never wanted to
78:03
take him to a funeral he would laugh
78:04
because he had that joy in him
78:07
and uh so we really loved him a lot he
78:09
got married his wife eventually passed
78:11
away
78:12
and he he really missed her after after
78:14
she passed away and so then he wasn't
78:17
feeling well i think he just wanted to
78:19
go to heaven anyway we were with him a
78:21
lot in the last few weeks especially my
78:23
husband actually went and cared for him
78:25
and i was out speaking and my husband
78:28
called and they said the the hospital is
78:30
telling me they don't think he'll make
78:31
it through the night so we came directly
78:33
from the airport to his hospital room
78:36
and he was like in icu
78:38
and this precious person who wasn't um
78:41
used to be a hospice nurse
78:43
was had gotten um i guess he got trained
78:46
to be an intern or something he was
78:48
there present with him he was so undone
78:51
that we were we came to be with him even
78:52
though we weren't family family i said
78:55
oh he is like family and i knew
78:57
everything that was going on i saw
78:59
angels waiting
79:00
somewhere in the room some were just his
79:02
own angels were around his bed all the
79:04
time they were touching him they were
79:06
saying things in his ear
79:08
i had time to call each of our daughters
79:10
and let them say goodbye to him because
79:12
he was that precious to them
79:14
and then and the guy said well he's
79:16
going to be another eight hours and i'm
79:18
like no he's not
79:19
i was telling
79:21
he said how do you know that i see the
79:22
angels who are about to come in i said
79:24
they're waiting they're waiting for us
79:26
to make sure we get our daughters to say
79:27
goodbye and he's going to go he's
79:29
probably maybe in the next hour he'll be
79:30
gone he said oh i don't think so well
79:33
it's okay it's all right don't worry
79:34
about it and so this is our last
79:36
daughter
79:38
said to him in his ears no he wasn't
79:40
responding i mean he his heartbeat was
79:42
still going but his angels were watching
79:45
everything we did they would smile every
79:47
time wow her daughters got to say it
79:49
went in his spirit it went into spirit
79:52
and i saw the words going in his spirit
79:54
it was very powerful and then more and
79:56
more angels began to come in behind the
79:58
others and i went it's not going to be
79:59
very long and so my husband said goodbye
80:01
to him i said goodbye to him and there
80:03
was a rush
80:05
there was a rush you could i could hear
80:07
and feel the rush the rush of angels
80:09
filling the room and then he goes
80:12
his spiritual body went out and went
80:13
well he's gone and he goes no he's not
80:16
and then there goes zayn
80:18
[Laughter]
80:20
then he starts to cry he goes you really
80:22
saw that happen
80:24
i'm like yes this is what happened he
80:26
said i always thought
80:28
that they were alone everybody was alone
80:30
they died and went no no their angels do
80:32
not leave them if they're going to
80:34
heaven they can't leave them they'll
80:36
always be with them and when they step
80:38
out of their body the first thing
80:39
they'll see is they're greening their
80:41
guardian angels so they're getting to
80:44
finally see the one who's been with them
80:46
since they were since before they were
80:47
born actually so i saw them all
80:49
according to the room filled with light
80:52
shh
80:52
and they rushed in and took him and went
80:54
up wow well he's gone
80:57
wow wow okay and it's amazing to me that
81:00
you know
81:01
god could have done it with just one
81:03
angel he didn't need a room full of it
81:05
what's what's the deal with that why
81:08
why
81:09
we're our benefit to know
81:11
uh chief loved people
81:14
he would give you the shirt off his back
81:16
he was so kind and he loved people i
81:19
think it was out of honor of how he
81:21
lived his life i think it was about the
81:23
honor he had
81:24
uh not even so much as us but i got to
81:26
witness it and the more you honor god
81:29
with your life um the more are going to
81:32
be present to escort you home to heaven
81:35
and like i saw i mean i saw many known
81:38
people uh being taken up to heaven and
81:40
jesus came and got them himself and in
81:43
his fiery chariot and he just held out
81:45
his hand he said come on it's time to go
81:47
home
81:48
and they would not even hesitate to get
81:50
there the guardian angels were right
81:51
there so it is a powerful you're seeing
81:54
a hospital room with you know the bags
81:57
hooked to them you see this
81:59
but in the spirit
82:01
if you're love and belong to jesus
82:02
christ there is a celebration going on
82:05
around you in that room
82:07
you don't wait to get to heaven to have
82:09
the peace and joy of god it floods the
82:11
room that's what part of the light was
82:13
that light came and filled his physical
82:16
body with that light and then it took
82:18
his spirit man just came out
82:21
wow
82:22
filled with joy and celebration they
82:24
were celebrating that he was going home
82:27
to heaven so even though you thought
82:29
they were alone they died
82:31
not alone if they belong to jesus christ
82:34
so so so many people are hearing this
82:36
and their fear of death is leaving them
82:38
i mean i can feel it happen that is very
82:40
very cool so many hundreds hundreds of
82:42
thousands
82:43
you have more light
82:45
spiritual bodies
82:46
the room is filled with the light of god
82:49
the glory coming off of your angels the
82:51
grins on their faces
82:53
and uh if it's your guardian angel and
82:55
you liked something like i still
82:57
remember the young man who passed who
82:58
was like a comedian
83:00
he passed young and he used to wear this
83:03
clown nose all the time in church just
83:05
to make jokes to people and everything
83:07
when he passed i saw it when he he the
83:10
angel tried to get him to come and get
83:12
him to come and and he didn't look up
83:14
and finally goes it's time to go when he
83:16
looks up his own angel is wearing a red
83:19
clown nose
83:22
are you serious are you serious
83:24
and then the young man did not hesitate
83:27
he just went forward like this he
83:29
stepped out his physical body fell back
83:31
and he said here's one for you and gave
83:33
him a clown nose to wear on his trip
83:36
home to heaven
83:38
