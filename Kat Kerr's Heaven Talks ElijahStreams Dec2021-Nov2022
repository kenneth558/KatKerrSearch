the way uh i'm i'm going to say this
01:52
before i forget to make the announcement
01:53

01:55
might forget if i don't say it
01:57
you know we have cats we have questions
01:59
for cat already for today so we don't
02:01
need those uh our staff decided it would
02:03
be great to have you ask any and all
02:05
kinds of questions about christmas
02:08
as it relates to heaven or whatever cat
02:10
knows is seeing understands so ask your
02:13
questions about christmas for next
02:15
week's broadcast most of the
02:18
people put those questions underneath
02:21
the youtube not in the chat to the right
02:22
but underneath uh where you put your
02:24
comments where they stay there not the
02:26
ones that just disappear and roll off
02:28
the screen
02:29
um and there are other ways we get them
02:31
too some people have hit reply and do
02:33
different things that our preferred
02:35
method is below youtube um and we'll try
02:38
and look at other places as well but
02:39
that's we're going to tell you that
02:40
specific one so i want to thank
02:42
everybody for your amazing donations
02:45
yesterday we pretty much had an
02:47
unprecedented number of donations and we
02:49
really appreciate that this ministry is
02:51
really growing by leaps and bounds uh
02:54
after the first we've got several more
02:55
people we'll be bringing on board in
02:57
fact we'll make those announcements at
02:59
the right time just a few of those
03:01
we will announce like this
03:04
i think that some of you have seen
03:05
illumination who now works for us we we
03:08
got her by making the announcement on
03:10
the
03:11
air so we will be making some
03:12
announcements
03:13
uh either next week or after the first
03:15
i'll see what the staff wants to do and
03:17
then people can then begin to send those
03:19
in so we'll figure out how to do that
03:21
and give you an address
03:23
or email whatever the staff wants and
03:25
we'll tell you which positions we're
03:26
looking for so
03:28
but anyway thank you very much for your
03:29
generosity i know it's the as you we
03:32
approach the year end many of you are
03:34
trying to to determine what you want to
03:36
do with your what things you want to do
03:38
with your um final giving for the year
03:40
we certainly appreciate you thinking
03:42
about us you know i've said that we've
03:44
built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda
03:46
and and then we've doubled the size we
03:48
paid for the construction of doubling
03:51
the size of the health clinic
03:53
on in that ugandan village i haven't
03:54
even shown you that picture yet uh we
03:57
have to work we're committed to do 24 to
03:59
dig 24 new wells in and around that
04:02
community and region and some of you who
04:05
saw that video we'll show it several
04:06
more times you saw that the people were
04:09
drinking
04:10
some of them when the water is running
04:12
off of the piglet tree into the water
04:14
that they they put in their drinking
04:15
water and they bring it home it's just a
04:17
horrific thing so we're digging
04:19
freshwater wells thank you so much for
04:21
your i i would say your help you know
04:24
it's not just you helped us you did it
04:26

05:46
next week you probably heard that and we
05:49

05:51
you talked about christmas town all that
05:52
so i'll have you just kind of elaborate
05:54
on that next week so well
05:57
yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll
06:00
just jump in um before we have any
06:02
questions cat what kind of anything
06:04
current events you'd like to share
06:07
uh
06:08
well i do there are there are things out
06:10
there everybody knows about and things
06:12
people can't know about right now but i
06:14
i can continue to tell you that that
06:17
foundation of the left is crumbling
06:20
um there's other people leaving their
06:22
positions because they're being exposed
06:25
in that is privately
06:27
that i can't announce who that is but
06:30
that big support this is the thing when
06:33
you lose your support like you were
06:35
saying you can't do anything that is
06:36
absolutely true but guess what it's also
06:38
true for the left
06:40
all the people who are jumping on that
06:42
bandwagon are jumping off many of them
06:45
are jumping off some of those are really
06:47
big supporters and i can tell you bottom
06:50
line why i can tell you why they want to
06:52
have money left over
06:54
because they keep being asked for more
06:56
and more and more you can't give
06:57
yourself to something that is totally
07:00
darkness and think they're going to let
07:03
you go how about if i give you that as a
07:05
tip
07:05
you can't do it you can run in
07:07
and agree and participate with things
07:10
that are evil
07:11
and think that will let you go
07:14
i can also tell a story about that there
07:17
are people who were part of an extreme
07:19
dark uh uh thing that was going on this
07:22
is probably maybe 15 years ago
07:24
and they actually had seen demons talk
07:27
to demons and not trying to scare
07:28
anybody they gave permission
07:31
they gave permission and they thought
07:33
what they got to do was exciting and
07:35
amazing but guess what they wouldn't let
07:37
them go they tormented them for the next
07:40
10 years of their life
07:42
and and they just couldn't get rid of
07:44
they didn't get rid of them because you
07:46
can't give yourself to something it's
07:49
like what god says what you enter into
07:52
will enter into you and that's how
07:54
simply something that's one liners of
07:56
some of the most powerful things he ever
07:58
says to me but what you choose to enter
08:00
into will enter into your soul that's
08:02
just what happens and either you think
08:04
about it you want to run after it or
08:06
else you give them a tie to you and
08:08
these people actually gave a tie
08:11
to to this these beings that were um
08:14
beginning to torment them when they were
08:16
done with the fun thing they thought
08:17
they were going to be a part of which
08:18
was dark was really bad i'm not going to
08:20
tell you what that was but they couldn't
08:22
get rid of them finally they had to
08:24
repent
08:25
and and cleanse their soul and every
08:28
every place they lived they had a place
08:30
that the demons would always come in at
08:31
night and torment him they couldn't do
08:33
anything about it
08:34
so they had somebody get hold of me
08:37
i didn't meet with them i told them what
08:39
they would have to do and they could
08:40
never ever go to that place again
08:43
and they would have to just you know
08:45
make sure that they
08:46
got that out of their soul number one
08:48
but they actually had to renounce
08:50
anything or any hold or tie that
08:53
darkness have with them that they gave
08:55
permission to that's the difference and
08:58
people who are just maybe attacked every
09:00
now and then that's it that's illegal
09:02
that's taken to the course of heaven
09:04
sometimes and sometimes god just comes
09:06
in supernaturally and ends that that's
09:09
like an attack this is not what these
09:11
people were doing they willingly
09:13
participated in these evil acts that
09:15
were happening somewhere and that's why
09:18
it took longer to get rid of it they
09:21
finally broke it they have had no no
09:24
nothing else come they stopped coming
09:26
they severed that tie they severed that
09:29
portal that was open by their own
09:31
repentance and then um having to take
09:33
communion over the whole thing and you
09:35
know what they attempted to come back
09:37
but they said they couldn't they served
09:38
only the living god they would not serve
09:41
the enemy again so that's why it's so
09:44
important to make sure you never get
09:46
into one of those places or participate
09:48
like that it's really hard to get rid of
09:50
and that's what people are finding out
09:52
now
09:52
who already have been a part of this
09:54
thing this year and a half long thing
09:56
that's been going on in our country
09:58
more and more people think i can make
10:00
money if i let them use me for this or
10:02
if i lie about this or if i cheat in
10:05
this way i'll make money well they're
10:07
finding out they're losing their money
10:08
that's what's happening they're losing
10:10
their money and once they make a tie or
10:13
a contract with this darkness that's
10:15
going on they won't let you go that's
10:18
why you don't want to participate in the
10:19
beginning you stand strong against
10:21
everything that's going on you keep
10:23
running after god right now in your life
10:26
and don't forget to celebrate he's still
10:28
saying that to me god has already seen
10:30
the beginning to the end he knows
10:32
exactly what will happen and i know
10:34
there's a lot of theories and
10:36
assumptions and people think they know
10:37
what's going to happen i can tell you
10:39
god is going to decide when that does
10:41
happen when it does it will be so great
10:43
you won't have to wonder if you'll hear
10:45
about it so this is just a tip to people
10:47
or those who are still in the darkness
10:49
you better get out while you can if you
10:52
don't you probably will lose everything
10:54
because this is an evil thing happening
10:56
in our country you cannot steal a
10:57
country you cannot give yourself to
10:59
satan or his evil ex and think he will
11:03
let go of you if you're already stepping
11:05
outside of that maybe you never got born
11:07
again you better get bored again really
11:09
quick
11:10
i will say that you better get born
11:11
again because that's probably the one
11:13
thing that can save you from all the
11:15
stuff you've been involved in but
11:17
there's already people they've already
11:18
got some people who are being witnesses
11:20
um to a lot of these accounts that
11:22
excuse me that are happening so i would
11:24
just encourage you and i'm gonna keep
11:26
doing it get out of that darkness while
11:28
you can
11:29
repent make sure you make sure you tell
11:32
somebody who is accountable
11:34
who is an authority in the area that's
11:37
just looking to see what's going on so i
11:40
just want to encourage people those
11:41
things are happening right now people
11:44
are uh they're distancing themselves
11:46
from some people they're actually
11:48
getting out of these things themselves
11:50
but people who have money are finding
11:53
that if something doesn't happen to stop
11:55
this whole thing they themselves will
11:58
have no money or property so let me tell
12:01
you evil will never bless you evil can't
12:04
create life or hope or something that's
12:06
going to help there is no help in evil
12:09
and darkness that comes from god that
12:11
comes from belonging to jesus christ so
12:14
all you who've been out there have been
12:15
strong and stayed strong and given hope
12:18
to people that that god does know what's
12:20
going on don't give up okay you got to
12:22
stay strong it says making your stand
12:24
and standing there for us i just want to
12:26
applaud you
12:28
yeah yeah
12:29
making a great stand for jesus christ
12:33
he made everything we know and see
12:36
nothing is hidden from him so if you
12:38
think because god's not saying anything
12:41
right now to everybody that does not
12:44
mean he doesn't he does have a plan he
12:46
he does he does have a plan for all of
12:48
this that's good ken i think you said
12:50
something a minute ago and i thought you
12:51
know i'm going to ask her to expound on
12:53
that you said people had sold out to
12:55
darkness and you got them into
12:57
repentance and to receiving the lord if
12:59
they hadn't but then you said
13:01
they took communion over that thing or
13:04
something to the that effect and you're
13:06
you're speaking about communion as if
13:08
it's a weapon
13:10
and let me just
13:11
ask you to expand uh expound on the
13:14
weapon of communion what does that
13:16
actually do
13:17
when people take communion
13:19
it is so powerful and
13:22
unfortunately most churches has just
13:24
become a tradition yeah
13:26
i will give you a good example of that i
13:29
remember
13:30
where i was attending at one time it had
13:32
become like a tradition
13:34
that doesn't make god very happy because
13:37
there is power in the blood of jesus
13:39
christ and his surrender totally to the
13:42
father's will and even his own
13:44
willingness to do he didn't have to do
13:47
anything at the cross and no matter what
13:49
people think don't take the crosses off
13:51
your wall now that you think he's not on
13:52
it anymore his own personal mark he
13:55
makes as a carpenter is a cross that's
13:58
what he does even in heaven when he
13:59
makes things that is significant
14:02
it means everything to all those who are
14:04
a believer who have received the the
14:07
sacrifice that christ did and died for
14:09
us he shed his own blood for us that is
14:11
a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks
14:14
things sometimes that nothing else can
14:18
and especially people if they've had
14:20
things going on in their house at night
14:22
maybe they may be familiar spirits or
14:24
other kind of spirits if there's nothing
14:26
else you can do you've prayed maybe
14:28
you've fasted you need to take communion
14:31
yourself over your property and then you
14:33
go outside and you pour some on the land
14:36
and say with the blood of jesus christ i
14:38
redeem this land a shockwave
14:41
of jesus christ will it tell you it will
14:44
embed itself in the property you're
14:46
living on and then you invite holy
14:49
spirit to invade it just invite the
14:51
spirit of god to invade it and let me
14:53
tell you what it'll be hard for anything
14:55
spiritually bad or evil to come on that
14:58
property it would be too painful for
15:00
them
15:00
taking communion is something some
15:03
people actually do every day
15:04
and i do it about once a month myself at
15:07
least sometimes more than that
15:10
and recently we just cleansed our land
15:12
again and let me tell you what the peace
15:15
of god with the presence of god will
15:17
infuse that the presence of god is in
15:19
communion
15:21
it represents many things it represents
15:23
the sec
15:25
reminds us of the sacrifice christ did
15:28
but it's something that brings us
15:30
together if you do that with your family
15:33
it will be so powerful in the spirit it
15:35
brings a bond with you and your family
15:38
together when you take that together
15:40
recognizing together as a family what
15:42
christ did for you
15:44
sometimes it opens things you never
15:46
could get open sometimes it breaks the
15:48
power of the enemy that nothing else
15:50
will break i even tell people who've
15:52
been sick for a long time you should be
15:54
taking communion over your body it says
15:57
very clearly in the bible what you know
16:00
what he did by his stripes what does it
16:03
say
16:04
you are healed okay the blood it helps
16:07
your mind and your mental faculties it
16:10
just does
16:11
physically mentally and emotionally it
16:14
can heal things and break things off of
16:16
you that never could be broken off
16:18
before
16:19
wow
16:20
that's my you know my spiritual father
16:22
wade taylor last five years of his life
16:24
he was my spiritual father he would take
16:27
communion every single day and i believe
16:29
he sometimes several times today his and
16:32
his he believed that the lord had shown
16:34
him that the closest thing we have you
16:36
know the tree of life isn't on the earth
16:38
right now he he strong
16:40
strongly believed that the taking
16:42
communion was the closest thing we had
16:44
to a tree of life on the earth as far as
16:47
the natural
16:48
you know elements that type of thing is
16:50
interesting you know and he was a very
16:51
healthy man until you know finally it
16:53
was his time and suddenly he was gone
16:55
but uh yeah that was i i've never looked
16:57
at communion the same since he since he
16:59
said that because i thought you know
17:01
that what if he's true
17:03
what if it's true that there's so much
17:05
more healing available to us
17:08
there is you know and i remember at
17:10
least i was in at the time that they had
17:12
just did it they were doing it again
17:13
just as a rope thing as a just a normal
17:16
thing they did once a month and god
17:19
yelled from heaven to me it is holy it
17:22
is holy it is holy
17:25
and i'm telling you the presence of god
17:27
fell so strong on me he said you will
17:29
say something about this and
17:32
so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh
17:35
one of the prophets visiting visiting
17:38
and uh
17:39
they read it to the congregation like a
17:41
week later they read it and the power of
17:43
god fell on the entire church and people
17:46
actually got on their knees and repented
17:49
for not taking it for the full uh the
17:51
power of god that was in it the fullness
17:54
of his sacrifices in there well what
17:56
what did he represent he represented
17:58
life hope joy
18:00
healing
18:01
empowerment that's what's in that's
18:04
what's in taking communion that's what
18:06
that means
18:07
that's profound i mean it's just so
18:09
profound yeah when i was raised up but
18:12
i'll get into these questions here when
18:13
i was raised
18:14
in a fundamental church it was like
18:16
every 13 weeks we had a communion they
18:19
even did the foot washing with it and
18:20
all that but it was like if we could
18:22
figure out a way to get out of that
18:24
particular
18:25
uh church service and stay home and once
18:28
in a while we'd figure out something
18:29
like let's go to the beach today it was
18:32
it was just a ritual there was no power
18:35
in it and we just looked for ways to get
18:37
out boy i would never do that
18:39
you know with my
18:40
understanding
18:42
it's very powerful here's
18:44
here's the first question um
18:46
this is a two-part i'll just read them
18:48
both but my mother was in her last days
18:50
in the hospital in hospice she kept
18:52
telling me about these beautiful atriums
18:55
she kept seeing i personally believe god
18:57
was showing her glimpses of heaven
18:59
before she passed so question when are
19:01
there
19:01
atriums in heaven and two does god
19:04
reveal heaven to people in their last
19:07
hours or moments to comfort them or to
19:09
prepare them before they die
19:11
um well that the last part is absolutely
19:14
true some people it's their first
19:17
glimpse of not just having
19:20
many people in their last maybe maybe
19:22
the last week especially they'll begin
19:24
to see family members who are in heaven
19:26
they'll just
19:27
see their faces or something sometimes
19:29
they might hear them say something
19:31
that's not like they're going to abide
19:32
there with them but he is letting them
19:35
have glimpses of having something else
19:37
they'll see many times are their own
19:39
angels
19:40
or or they'll just see angels in the
19:42
room that's really a clue that they're
19:44
probably not going to stay very long
19:46
and but if everything jesus christ
19:49
unless they walk up and he walks up to
19:50
him and say you know you will live and
19:53
not die or it's not your time but
19:55
sometimes he'll catch them up there and
19:57
tell them there and then send them back
19:59
but if if they begin to tell you that
20:01
i've seen jesus then that either means
20:04
they're going to be fully healed or
20:05
they're going to be fully healed by
20:06
going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of
20:09
that happens sometimes you'll give them
20:10
glimpses of mansions in heaven or the
20:12
streets of gold or even the throne
20:15
sometimes so that is absolutely that
20:17
part's absolutely true i think because
20:20
their spiritual body is getting more
20:22
aware
20:23
and um
20:24
even when it gets close to them stepping
20:26
out and they literally step out of their
20:28
body that's what they do if they're
20:30
sitting up naturally they'll just step
20:32
right out of their the physical body
20:34
it'll fall back but there they are right
20:36
there looking at their own body that's
20:38
happened to a lot of people and then
20:39
jesus would say it's not your time so
20:41
they have to go back in
20:42
wow there are many different things that
20:44
could happen some people were here
20:46
heavenly choir saying that part is very
20:48
true
20:49
and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about
20:51
something else in a minute about the
20:53
choirs but that is true and yes uh even
20:57
sometimes when people are really sick
20:59
maybe they're not terminal they will see
21:01
glimpses of places in heaven and i
21:03
believe the atrium thing that they're
21:04
seeing is probably some beautiful part
21:06
of the gardens of heaven uh there's a
21:09
friendly forest in heaven they have
21:11
beautiful gardens surrounding that
21:13
there's a butterfly there's like this
21:15
beautiful meadow where butterflies are
21:18
uh they actually will sing you hear them
21:20
singing so they could hear a heaven part
21:23
of heaven singing they could see angels
21:24
i could see family members there
21:26
and that does bring peace to them and
21:28
sometimes not just peace some people get
21:30
really excited when they when they have
21:32
glimpses of heaven like that that's
21:34
amazing well that's it's encouraging
21:36
because as i said the number of times my
21:38
mom's real close i'm kind of curious by
21:40
the way regarding that now my mom's
21:43
memory is going we just got back from
21:44
ohio she's got now she doesn't remember
21:47
from conversation to conversation
21:50
a few minutes late does god
21:53
let me ask it this way does god have a
21:54
harder time getting a hold of someone
21:56
like that who needs a little bit more of
21:58
him or does he have an easier time
22:00
because she's
22:02
tuned out of life what would that be
22:04
like
22:05
for her to maybe
22:07
i think it wouldn't matter what state
22:09
they're in mentally emotionally or
22:11
physically
22:13
when he wants to make himself known or
22:15
let them begin many times if we're
22:17
saying they feel no matter where they
22:19
are on their path if they belong to him
22:21
it he already has that connection with
22:24
them in their spirit
22:26
when he's ready to show them something
22:27
he's going to do it but normally that
22:29
will begin to change that person and
22:31
even if they can't remember what they
22:32
ate the day before who visit them the
22:34
day before they normally will not forget
22:36
if they begin to have encounters and
22:39
sometimes it's not like a face-to-face
22:41
encounter sometimes it's his presence uh
22:44
sometimes they they may say oh i feel
22:46
really good right now i i feel amazing i
22:49
feel such peace on me that's usually
22:51
because christ could be in that room
22:54
with them right there in that moment i
22:56
just know that sometimes it might be a
22:57
little bit easier in my thinking if your
23:00
natural mind begins to shut down or your
23:02
memory system the reason for that is
23:05
they can't remember the things that they
23:06
were angry about they can't remember
23:08
things
23:09
you know they can't remember their cares
23:11
they can't remember their concerns they
23:12
don't remember any things that were said
23:14
to them or maybe things that they did
23:16
that they shouldn't have you know maybe
23:18
unkind words that's gone from them so
23:21
that does totally open it up for the
23:24
lord to begin to either speak to them or
23:25
begin to show them things so this that
23:27
might be a good thing well you know it's
23:29
interesting you would say that i wasn't
23:30
going to share this but you know my
23:32
life's an open book right now but you
23:34
know
23:36
what what's that
23:39
you love it it's so open because every
23:40
millions are white i know well we went
23:43
out in march and i i was thinking i was
23:45
being a good dutiful
23:47
obedient loving son to offer her to come
23:51
and live with us from ohio and boy oh
23:53
heck broke liz and i understand this is
23:56
this is really what happens to a lot of
23:58
seniors at this age they if you think
24:03
if they're thinking you're taking their
24:04
blasted i mean she didn't say any bad
24:06
words but she was furious he was
24:09
okay so now fast forward we just can't
24:11
went out there in ohio and we were
24:14
itching her along
24:15
and then she called me after we we got
24:18
back and and
24:20
she's now she's inviting herself to live
24:22
with me instead of the other
24:24
i said i said well mom
24:27
you
24:27
you know after you treated me so
24:30
horribly and she goes what are you
24:31
talking about and she made me repeat it
24:33
five times and she didn't even remember
24:35
after five seconds after i told her she
24:37
said now tell me again what i did then
24:39
we found out later she doesn't even
24:41
remember any of us flying out there
24:43
during march
24:44
yeah that does that actually doesn't
24:48
happen as part of the process of just
24:50
being prepared many times just to just
24:53
to leave
24:54
um but that's normal and you're right
24:56
that's very normal
24:58
and
24:59
even most people when they of course if
25:01
they're still around here around a
25:02
heaven uh a hundred years old you you
25:05
should see some of them some of them are
25:06
sharp as attack but in the natural most
25:09
people's bodies and their systems and
25:11
the way they operate their thinking it
25:14
kind of begins to shut down some uh they
25:16
may be alert in every other way but
25:19
their memory from like the day before
25:21
whatever like she was saying to you that
25:23
might be god's blessing sometimes
25:25
because like you said she didn't
25:26
remember even saying that yeah it feels
25:28
like well i had i had actually been
25:31
again here's that open book thing i was
25:33
really wounded i was hurt and i kind of
25:36
cared that i kept forgetting her in my
25:37
heart all this time after i found out
25:40
yesterday that she has no recollection
25:43
i'm thinking what
25:45
what how what purpose would it be to
25:47
even have any hurt left what have i
25:49
heard about something that she has no
25:51
recollection of ever doing so it's like
25:53
it just fell off it just fell off
26:00
it's almost like
26:01
maybe a child does something not to hurt
26:03
you on purpose but it just happens you
26:05
know
26:06
and uh especially in the different
26:08
growing years they might say something
26:09
hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and
26:12
it it it's part of their growing the
26:15
young on the young side but when they're
26:18
older it's just part of what's natural
26:21
and i think that is i know people who've
26:23
forgotten that went through traumas and
26:25
stuff not not my family of other people
26:27
had horrible traumas when they got
26:29
closer to that age they didn't even
26:30
remember it it's like it just naturally
26:33
left them and they're happy i've also
26:36
known people who like almost couldn't
26:37
stand being around somebody and now they
26:40
love them it's the same
26:42
same people but but they really love
26:44
them because the person who was holding
26:46
that was gone because the memory part
26:48
was gone
26:49
so yes steve you can't you can't hold it
26:51
against somebody who to them like well
26:52
that never happened i would never say
26:54
that
26:55
they mean to you i never said that
26:58
yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't
27:00
you know i was
27:03
you were hurting that hurt
27:07
so anyway that's good all right here we
27:09
go
27:10
he goes i'm i'm finding out that my
27:12
seven-year-old son
27:13
is a seer what is your number one piece
27:15
of advice for a young seer for their
27:17
parents his sister has an autoimmune
27:20
issue and he said that once while we
27:21
were praying for her healing he looked
27:24
up and saw a small angel about four
27:26
inches tall
27:27
with wings wearing a red dress with her
27:29
hand on my daughter's foot praying for
27:32
her would that have been her guardian
27:34
angel that my son saw or a different one
27:37
sent for specific purpose so it's kind
27:39
of a multi-part there that probably
27:41
would be a different one sent for a
27:43
specific purpose but since you brought
27:44
that whole thing up
27:46
i i have known families who had a child
27:49
who was handicapped in some way
27:52
they get extra angels assigned to them
27:54
just because of that what we would call
27:57
a disability uh they get extra ones
27:59
assigned to them
28:00
and this young man now is so almost
28:03
absolutely normal he has some physical
28:05
things not causing him pain but growing
28:07
up they said he wouldn't live they said
28:09
he would never have a normal mind he
28:11
would never be able to talk never feed
28:13
himself and this was being fed to this
28:15
young child's parents like their whole
28:17
life they refused to accept that they
28:19
made sure he had everybody the care that
28:21
he had but they talked to him normal
28:24
they didn't treat him like there's
28:25
something wrong with him and he has two
28:28
angels that are with him all the time
28:29
besides his guardian angel and they're
28:31
there because of this this handicap
28:34
thing he has like i said this is like 30
28:36
years later and you know to see him he's
28:39
so filled with the light of god he's a
28:40
believer
28:42
and he's such a testimony to people
28:44
because of how he has grown in every way
28:46
that the doctor said he wouldn't be
28:47
alive but there were two angels assigned
28:50
to him and i knew somebody else who had
28:53
someone who was grown and they also had
28:56
two other angels and finally i just
28:57
asked holy spirit why are those other
28:59
angels with him
29:01
they looked different than from their
29:02
guardian angels and they said oh they're
29:04
sent to they they like protect the
29:07
anointing that they carry they're there
29:09
just to be uh yeah to bring things down
29:11
from heaven to them that god wants to
29:13
put into them i'm pretty certain that's
29:16
what that four inch angel was that was
29:18
like a little messenger angel bringing
29:20
something down they wouldn't be part of
29:22
the host but they probably were brought
29:24
down from heaven with one of the hosts
29:25
probably brought them down there so that
29:28
was great as far as being a seer
29:30
i would get a journal most important to
29:33
write down things that he's seeing it's
29:35
really important that they do that
29:38
when he gets older he'll be very
29:39
grateful for that journal uh like right
29:41
the day what he said he saw just write
29:44
in his words what he said
29:46
and then anytime he comes i've already
29:48
told some of my
29:50
my daughters to make sure that they do
29:51
that and so one of them has actually
29:53
started cataloging and now this child is
29:56
10
29:57
and he's not stopped seeing things but
29:59
it's very powerful to him that he can
30:01
read about the things he said that he
30:03
heard said or that he saw so definitely
30:07
most important thing you can do is uh no
30:09
matter what god ends up by doing with
30:10
that gift he has
30:12
it will be very powerful one day make
30:14
sure you're writing it down yeah and
30:16
what
30:16
what's the deal with the four inch angel
30:20
versus a seven foot angel i mean
30:22
what would you say about that
30:24
i would say
30:25
possibly whatever it is that the child
30:28
is um whatever it was you said that they
30:30
had it probably there may be like a
30:33
tribe of those little angels like that
30:35
made for that specific thing
30:38
that they were diagnosed with and that
30:40
maybe that may be something that god
30:42
sends maybe his life is in them they're
30:44
they're probably putting the life of god
30:46
in them oh the peace of god in them so
30:49
that would be their only assignment that
30:51
would be what they would be sent for
30:52
probably to keep that child in peace or
30:55
the presence of god yeah i guess the
30:57
issue was it was she just said it was an
30:58
autoimmune issue so she didn't say that
31:01
so
31:01
okay melanie asked how old does god look
31:05
how old would we perceive him to be in
31:07
earthly terms i've heard you describe
31:09
kind of seeing his face but i've also
31:11
heard you describe
31:12
almost a little bit of a veil so i mean
31:14
how do you see him you and i talked on
31:16
the cruise that one time and i said are
31:19
you telling me
31:21
cat that you're sitting down
31:23
sitting down talking face to face with
31:25
the god of the whole cosmos
31:28
and you just like yeah
31:32
you know
31:32
that should be crazy
31:34
it would be like
31:36
asking that question to a child
31:38
that really saw something let's say your
31:40
child went and saw somebody or met
31:42
somebody and you maybe try to convince
31:44
them i don't think you saw them they
31:45
would be so adamant
31:47
uh that the child like part of me
31:50
there's nothing in me that could make up
31:52
anything he wouldn't use me at all if he
31:54
if if i did that i i'm a detailed person
31:57
so i'm always going to see details one
32:00
of the reasons why i see him clearly is
32:02
he chose me because i have a
32:05
photographic memory and i am a detailed
32:07
person like i'm not going to hear just a
32:09
sentence that he says i i'm taking
32:12
places that i have to remember all that
32:14
i saw
32:15
and then they have to write that down if
32:16
it's things that god came and told me
32:18
personally and he said i want you to i
32:21
want you to share this with people then
32:22
i have to remember exactly what he said
32:25
it's not like it becomes um familiar in
32:28
any way i won't even use that term
32:30
because the power uh the power he
32:33
carries i'm sure he has to probably uh
32:36
maybe minimize that a little bit just
32:38
for me to be able to be around him i
32:40
probably i sometimes i feel like
32:42
when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's
32:43
just to be in his presence i feel like
32:45
i'm going to melt and go inside of him i
32:47
don't know how to yeah outs to explain
32:49
that the love that comes from him is so
32:52
powerful and it's it's not just what i
32:55
feel his appearance is
32:57
quite striking if i could say that
33:01
you feel life
33:02
coming from him because it did we all
33:05
lived there so it's like he's holding
33:07
everything in him all of time is in him
33:09
he didn't appear somewhere time came
33:11
from him
33:12
and i know i i love the one-liners he
33:14
tells me to tell people they get their
33:16
heads so undone they try to wrap their
33:18
head around it but most of these things
33:19
are spiritually um discerned
33:22
i would say in his normal appearance
33:25
because i've seen him like a certain way
33:27
many times then there's times i've seen
33:29
him with flames of fire with lightning
33:31
bolts shooting out of him when he's
33:33
walking against the darkness and stuff
33:35
like that his own appearance begins to
33:37
change it talks about the wrath of god
33:41
and any believer you should know this
33:43
that we are not appointed under that
33:45
wrath that he was demonstrating that
33:46
would be evil in darkness and wickedness
33:50
that he despises evil he despise what it
33:53
does to people so if he was gonna catch
33:55
me up there and talk about the justice
33:58
that is coming then his whole appearance
34:00
would be to bring justice that would
34:03
show me that that fierce side of him
34:05
okay
34:06
the loving father side of him which is
34:08
what i see many times
34:10
i know his hair is made out of light
34:12
remember the father is all spiritual but
34:15
he still has the ability to hold me if
34:17
he wants to
34:19
or i can just stand next to him i can
34:22
see into his eyes and usually they're
34:23
like blue flames of fire they're they
34:26
look blue to me blue flames of fire but
34:28
what comes out of him if you could
34:30
picture
34:31
um
34:32
i love the northern lights i've not seen
34:34
them in person but i've seen god
34:37
and that's what that rainbow looks like
34:38
coming out of him if you ever wondered
34:40
it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not
34:42
like you could just paint it around him
34:45
and it would just be there and not have
34:46
life and movement and i would have to
34:48
say seeing the northern lights in the
34:50
way that they move like this coming out
34:53
of him continually and on these
34:56
waves of his rainbow which he it comes
34:59
from him no man made the rainbow people
35:02
it comes from the living god it's part
35:03
of his own appearance and his person and
35:06
out of that comes these little spirits
35:08
of life they'll ride on this rainbow
35:09
then ride back in him that's what you
35:11
used to do when you lived inside god it
35:14
says in him we live we move we have our
35:18
very being the prophets and poets of old
35:20
have spoken of these things what things
35:22
when they were shown that
35:25
way in the past god would show himself
35:26
to people sometimes and sometimes it was
35:29
someone who was a poet and they actually
35:30
wrote poems about that
35:32
and so one of those made it in the word
35:34
of god so that's just a part of him to
35:37
see him like that the creative side
35:40
where i would see jesus step out of the
35:42
father and the father would say
35:44
something and then he would make what he
35:47
said that's why he was called the word
35:50
we know in the book of john it says that
35:53
we know in the book of john when john
35:54
said
35:56
the word was with god
35:59
and was god and there was nothing that
36:01
was made that was not made by him
36:04
that was jesus christ that's who he the
36:07
word came to the earth and died uh as
36:10
the son of god and so they're one and
36:13
the same the word jesus christ are the
36:15
same but when he was the word he only
36:17
had a spiritual body he was all spirit
36:20
it was still a body i know in your mind
36:22
you can't imagine you think of something
36:24
like a little like a spirit like
36:26
whatever you want to call it like the
36:28
spirit of a person or something they're
36:30
much more there's much more to them than
36:32
just some little wispy thing if you're
36:35
in a spirit world which heaven is and
36:38
everyone there in the spiritual body
36:40
they look solid in that world okay so
36:43
when i see the father most of the time
36:45
he looks like he's solid although he's
36:47
all spirit so i've seen him with love
36:50
coming out that consumes like the whole
36:52
army of god before they're going to go
36:54
somewhere um to bring justice for him
36:57
over someone on the earth he'll
36:59
literally go and just stand in their
37:00
midst and every one of them will be
37:03
permeated with his love he loves them
37:05
too
37:06
and his love and and just empowerment
37:09
and and when you see that he's he is
37:12
kind
37:13
and he is good and many people don't see
37:16
the father is good but jesus himself
37:18
said there's none good but the father
37:21
and so when you see there's many
37:23
different parts of him sides of him
37:25
uh that's who he is but
37:27
i i'm always undone
37:30
when he comes most of the time
37:32
unannounced
37:33
because what is on his heart to share
37:35
i'm i'm his revelator that's what he
37:37
calls me that means i reveal for him
37:41
i don't reveal for a man so i'm not
37:43
gonna usually i can answer questions ask
37:45
me if i've been told or shown it
37:47
otherwise i can't answer that i can't
37:49
answer for him if i haven't been shown
37:51
or told something
37:54
so it's really quite undone sometimes
37:56
the room i'm in like where i sleep which
37:59
is in my office built this moment
38:01
there's a huge portal in that room and
38:04
and sometimes he would come down through
38:06
that portal but sometimes most likely in
38:08
the hotel room a lot of times he'll just
38:10
walk through the wall like it's not
38:12
there and he'll begin to tell me stuff
38:14
sometimes he'll tell me to write it down
38:16
sometimes he'll write on the wall
38:18
and we know that even in the word of god
38:20
it talks about him doing these things so
38:22
for him
38:23
those are normal things he does when he
38:25
when he knows somebody who's going to
38:27
tell the truth who will not embellish on
38:29
what he
38:31
what he said which is extremely
38:33
significant even john the baptist had
38:36
one of the greatest revelations ever
38:37
given on the earth that's why they said
38:39
he's the greatest prophet of all that's
38:41
why that's in there he announced
38:43
literally
38:44
here is the son of god he actually got
38:47
to say that even though in the natural
38:48
he was jesus's cousin when he spoke
38:51
those words he wasn't speaking from a
38:53
natural viewpoint he was speaking from a
38:55
divine point and he never changed as
38:57
much as that he came that he came to say
39:00
that you had to repent of your sins
39:01
right he was one of the first ones to
39:03
give that message so what he said was so
39:06
powerful when he actually said here he
39:08
is
39:09
uh the the first and only person on the
39:11
earth who could actually say here's
39:13
jesus christ the son of the living god
39:15
this is the messiah that was a powerful
39:17
word but he never changed what he said
39:19
because that's what god told him to say
39:22
wow yeah and you've always been obedient
39:24
that way you know almost to a
39:26
frustrating point because people will
39:27
ask you something i've seen it even on
39:29
um
39:30
what's the kenneth copeland channel i
39:32
can't think of any victory channel or
39:33
whatever and flashpoint and they'll try
39:35
to get you to answer a question you'll
39:37
say i can only tell you what god told me
39:39
and then he'll launch into your
39:41
prophecy that was that's pretty i've
39:43
learned learned a good way um also
39:45
that's part of that same question is
39:47
does god the father does he look like a
39:50
grandpa does he look like a dad who's
39:52
older what what age
39:54
impression when he leaves well i know
39:56
you're wanting most people will judge
39:58
somebody by their skin
39:59
okay or conditioning is a skin and does
40:01
it have wrinkles does it not have
40:03
wrinkles does it have like brown spots
40:07
and most people judge people nor in the
40:10
natural you know um if they have white
40:12
hair no hair
40:14
i mean i i can't answer him in that
40:17
context i cannot put him in a category
40:20
as a human i know that i see life in him
40:23
i see still even now talking you can
40:26
still see his face
40:28
very clearly and it's filled with life
40:31
there's no age in him he's never going
40:34
to age his hair is white it's alive his
40:38
hair on his head is living it's not
40:40
short hair it's down below his shoulders
40:43
uh he has this amazing uh wonderful
40:46
beard
40:47
um
40:48
it just you know i can't i tell people
40:50
say what do you think he looks like
40:51
kenny rogers he doesn't look like a
40:53
human
40:56
everyone fails in comparison to him
40:59
because of the stuff he carries that
41:02
makes him who he is
41:04
but i can just say that you will you'll
41:06
never regret giving yourself to his son
41:09
that is the one where you are assured of
41:11
meeting him in person
41:13
he's excited about seeing you he cannot
41:15
wait for you to get back home to heaven
41:18
and i hope this gives you a glimpse of
41:20
the other side of dying for you you're
41:22
losing something for him he's gaining
41:24
something he's gaining his son or his
41:27
daughter back to himself he is so
41:30
excited all of heaven celebrates when
41:32
they come home so for them there's
41:35
there's there's no loss in their mind uh
41:38
from the time they step out of the
41:39
spiritual body they're stepping right
41:41
there they feel his presence they see
41:43
their angels their excitement floods
41:46
them you know i mean it's not like they
41:48
don't love you to actually love you even
41:49
more
41:50
but but just to be in his presence i
41:53
understand why jesus when he had to live
41:55
on the earth he'd go away to the
41:56
mountains to to be with his father he
41:58
would go away to go be that he needed it
42:00
after living here with humans are you
42:02
kidding
42:03
and so king himself
42:05
loves the father and i think for him the
42:08
greatest thing he gets to do is take us
42:10
back to him when you come home to heaven
42:12
he walks you up the steps of god's
42:15
throne the father's throne and gives you
42:18
back to him he says
42:20
your son your daughter they've come home
42:22
and let me tell you the celebration will
42:24
start in heaven at that time but but he
42:27
is not little he's not a little person
42:29
in any way whatsoever but this is what i
42:32
love about the father one of the
42:33
greatest things i like to say about him
42:35
is he could be a hundred feet tall two
42:37
thousand feet tall whatever he wants to
42:39
be he can be that size i think sitting
42:42
on the throne many times and to me he
42:44
would look like maybe i don't know 10 15
42:46
feet high he he doesn't want to make
42:48
himself invisible to you if you're
42:50
coming home to meet him but i've seen
42:52
him holding the earth in his hands so i
42:54
hope you get this picture i've seen him
42:57
back in time when he was making the
42:59
earth holding it in his hand this is the
43:02
father when the word would step out he'd
43:05
make it gave it to the father the father
43:07
began to speak over the earth itself
43:10
he would pour water from himself he's
43:12
going to put the water on the earth he
43:14
poured from his own south the river of
43:16
the river of life that comes from him he
43:19
poured that in as the ocean on the earth
43:23
and so whatever they did they did
43:24
together and so i've seen him that big
43:27
to hold the earth in his hand
43:32
i've seen him be you know make himself
43:36
well call enormous eyes just to hold you
43:38
he'll stand up on the throne and hold
43:39
you to himself
43:41
and i also know this about him that even
43:44
though he's on the throne
43:46
he himself can make himself
43:49
not leaving the throne
43:51
small enough to step inside of himself
43:54
to play with all the little spirits of
43:56
life that's who you were are you serious
43:59
with you in himself while he's sitting
44:02
on the throne people he knows what's
44:04
going on
44:06
if you think he's willing to give this
44:09
earth that he loved that he spoke over
44:12
to evil what do you think he didn't have
44:14
and he kicked it out it got unseated
44:18
lost his place lost his authority lost
44:21
his power
44:22
lucifer did you think he's changed his
44:25
mind about that because he has not
44:28
he loves you too much and this time is
44:32
too important for him to give it over to
44:34
evil all i know is they're going to lay
44:36
down roll over and beg god for mercy
44:40
when those days of justice fall upon
44:42
them and for some of them it will be too
44:45
late
44:47
wow wow catboy the anointing hit you
44:49
right there god came
44:51
god came down wow
44:53
wildcat
44:54
cat let me can i explore a little bit
44:56
you talk about the son loves the fat
44:58
father loves his son and son loves the
44:59
father i think we've talked about this a
45:01
little bit let me
45:03
drill down you know when i was raised up
45:04
we'd always make sure we pray in the
45:06
name of jesus make sure you say the name
45:08
of jesus and it became like a
45:10
a formulaic word make sure you mention
45:13
the name of jesus because then god can
45:15
has to do it but but is there something
45:18
in when we pray in the name of jesus
45:21
that we should at that moment
45:24
almost tap into how much the father
45:26
loves jesus
45:28
as we're saying that as opposed to just
45:30
making sure you pronounce jesus or
45:33
yeshua what
45:35
what is that go ahead and understand who
45:38
you're talking about when you use this
45:40
name
45:41
uh and if if there's probably if you're
45:44
saying it just from head knowledge this
45:46
is what you want to know don't ever say
45:48
his name from head knowledge
45:50
okay you need to say it from revelation
45:54
like what i just spoke okay that's how
45:57
you should feel every time you say his
45:59
name for any purpose you're having power
46:03
in that name of jesus that's why it is
46:05
one of your greatest weapons the name of
46:07
the name of christ okay his name his
46:10
blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of
46:14
who he is he right now he right now is
46:17
the king of glory people uh he has many
46:21
other titles besides jesus christ when
46:24
you talk about him as your savior and
46:26
what he did for you he also gave you
46:28
power over all the power of the enemy he
46:33
gave us three things you see him from
46:34
that viewpoint it should almost be like
46:38
a threat to hell that you are saying the
46:41
name of jesus christ
46:43
wow wow
46:45
yeah that's a whole lot different
46:47
well that's what the lord's been showing
46:48
me lately is is to tap into to that to
46:53
him to the reality
46:54
um
46:56
yeah and this one you kind of answered
46:58
this this is the next question but you
46:59
kind of addressed this
47:01
it says before jesus came to the earth
47:02
and he was called the word in heaven did
47:05
his spiritual body then look like
47:08
what we know as his human body or what
47:10
we think of as his human body or was his
47:12
body more like i don't know what i don't
47:14
know what this means was his body more
47:16
like the holy spirit i i think this
47:18
person's grasping between um
47:22
a cloud like the holy spirit or the body
47:24
of jesus but i i think they both have
47:27
um
47:28
a
47:29
spiritual butt right
47:32
yeah i would say when you are you
47:34
talking about let me get the timing
47:36
right are they talking about what jesus
47:37
looked like when he stepped out of his
47:39
physical body let me see when jesus came
47:41
to the earth and he was called the word
47:44
in heaven he was called the word did his
47:46
spiritual body then in heaven
47:50
look the same as his human body looked
47:52
on earth
47:54
oh when he was the word did it look the
47:56
same as the physical body on earth that
47:59
seemed to be the question no physical
48:00
body changed him from what he looked
48:03
like
48:05
because if it looked just like the word
48:07
why did not satan recognize him oh good
48:11
point oh good point he did not know when
48:14
he took him to the mountain temptation
48:15
that was the son of the living god he
48:18
didn't know that he was trying to find
48:19
out who he was
48:22
he was always pursuing who is he until
48:25
he himself said who he was he did not
48:28
know
48:29
he did not know he was the word that was
48:31
with god the word was all spiritual body
48:34
that was his divine body a spiritual
48:37
body a spiritual body like we were just
48:39
talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know
48:41
what they're talking about you're
48:43
talking about what they've seen on tv or
48:44
movies this little wispy thing steps out
48:46
they can go through walls and the reason
48:48
why uh your spiritual body down here
48:50
could walk through a wall is that
48:52
physical wall is a temporary substance
48:56
it's even a temporary realm the physical
48:59
realm is not the original realm the
49:01
spiritual realm where the whole world
49:03
called heaven was created where tribes
49:06
of angels were made where you go back
49:08
home to live in that place you don't
49:10
pass to the walls in heaven and your
49:12
spiritual body okay you have substance
49:15
in your spiritual body but as far as the
49:18
appearance thing the word was very
49:20
powerful he could go in and out wherever
49:23
he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he
49:25
had no flesh attached to him the other
49:28
sacrifice you don't realize he made was
49:31
he was willing not just to walk and live
49:34
in a physical body he had to keep the
49:36
physical body wow and so when your
49:39
little spirit person leaves god when you
49:42
lived in god you didn't look like
49:44
this okay you had a little appearance
49:47
you had a face you little face you had
49:48
body you could play inside of god and
49:50
the river of life climbed the mountain
49:51
that's in him a ride in and out on the
49:54
waves of the rainbow you could do those
49:56
things in your little spiritual body but
49:59
you didn't look
50:00
this gave you an identity okay that's
50:03
one of the reasons why he wanted you to
50:05
have a fleshly body number one so you
50:07
could live in this physical body in this
50:10
physical world and do things for him
50:12
here
50:13
but as opposed to the word the word look
50:16
different than jesus christ did because
50:19
the flesh wrapped around your spiritual
50:21
body
50:22
your spiritual body actually adapts to
50:26
the flesh
50:27
because when your throat man steps out
50:29
of this body when mine does
50:32
it looks the same as if i was in my
50:34
fleshly body except
50:37
i look a whole lot younger and so were
50:40
you one day so know that satan did not
50:43
recognize
50:45
who jesus christ was he didn't know he
50:47
was the word okay who made him actually
50:51
uh satan was created he's a created
50:53
being
50:54
he didn't know that that was the word he
50:56
didn't know at all
50:58
and that that was part of the bushwhack
51:00
people so that was part of the butch
51:02
whack that jesus would almost have a
51:04
disguise that satan wouldn't recognize
51:07
for a very long time jesus could do
51:09
things he wanted to say what he wanted
51:11
to and
51:12
and satan i'm sure was quite shocked
51:15
when jesus christ you know
51:17
living on the earth began to cast demons
51:20
out of things that really freaked him
51:21
out i'm really sure
51:23
now he said okay this person's got power
51:25
he's got power i i don't didn't know he
51:27
had this power uh
51:30
and he's not really as brilliant as he
51:32
wants people to think he is because when
51:34
he got kicked out the heaven part of his
51:35
mind was seared by that lightning bolt
51:38
i'm just letting you know so he did not
51:40
know that that jesus christ was the word
51:43
of god because jesus himself with his
51:46
fleshly body looked different than the
51:49
word and right now he still looks like
51:51
jesus christ who lived and walked on the
51:53
earth except for this
51:55
he has his glorified body already he was
51:58
glorified that body was glorified when
52:00
he stepped up from hell came up from
52:02
hell and stepped into that physical body
52:04
that was dead laying on that slab
52:07
life infused it but not just life but
52:09
the glory of god infused the body of
52:12
jesus christ and he walks around now in
52:13
his physical glorified body
52:16
in heaven so when he comes to see me
52:18
that's that's who i see is the one in
52:20
the glorified body and you know when you
52:22
said uh this is the first time it ever
52:24
clicked that we would have looked
52:26
different inside the father because we
52:28
would only look like we looked down
52:30
because i'm a combination of my mother
52:32
and my father that's
52:34
the appearance i took on
52:36
that's right because i had a natural
52:38
mother father so i don't look totally
52:40
different in heaven before god selected
52:42
the family for me i guess yes
52:45
he knew all along
52:47
he knew you would be looking like just
52:49
like you do now steve
52:51
he knew everybody would be looking like
52:52
that like they do right now in their
52:54
physical body he knew
52:56
when you were in him you were chosen
52:59
at that point for some things in your
53:01
life he put a little mark on you he knew
53:04
i would be a prophet he knew you would
53:06
make a home for the prophets to come and
53:08
say whatever god wanted to say he knew
53:10
that we probably knew each other we
53:12
probably were friends inside of him that
53:14
would be cool to know that would be
53:16
really interesting you think so we
53:18
wouldn't
53:18
be doing so because
53:20
i know
53:21
those who were friends inside of god if
53:23
he chose you to be a part of your
53:25
lifetime
53:27
uh in a significant way he would
53:30
absolutely choose people that kids that
53:32
you were like call them kids they all
53:34
little they're all little at all like a
53:36
bunch of little kids living in him and
53:38
and you had i would see little kids
53:40
sometimes with little groups playing
53:42
with each other and doing things with
53:43
each other and we we can have a whole
53:46
whole just segment about life and god uh
53:49
really that would be quite fascinating
53:51
to find out revelation about what did
53:53
you do in there what went on there what
53:54
does it look like and there's another
53:56
whole thing
53:57
but i'm pretty sure that we probably
53:59
were friends i know my husband and i
54:02
were friends when we were we were part
54:04
of this the little group that we had
54:06
uh inside god that we played there's
54:08
millions inside of him but
54:10
there's no back to god there's no size
54:13
to god it's like inside of him he's part
54:16
of infinity
54:17
and that at one time you know before he
54:19
made the earth we all everyone who ever
54:21
was or will be lived in him you can
54:24
imagine in your head let's hope you
54:26
maybe that makes you realize how
54:27
powerful he is about who he is uh he is
54:30
limitless in his understanding and his
54:32
knowledge and in his revelation he's
54:35
unlimited in almost every way he's
54:37
unlimited can i ask you a a difficult
54:41
question
54:42
that some watching will even um
54:45
it would be their question it would be
54:47
their question
54:49
god knew you before you were born he
54:51
knew what you would look like before you
54:52
were born and then there are people who
54:55
are product of of either
54:58
born out of wedlock in some cases rape
55:01
how do you what do you say to people who
55:03
say but what about me how could god have
55:05
known me
55:07
and allowed me to either have
55:10
children of abuse or
55:12
what do you say about the plan of god
55:14
and what
55:15
sometimes we're allowed to go through
55:17
in this life
55:19
i think one day
55:21
when you get your book given to you that
55:23
was written about you in heaven you'll
55:24
understand that he didn't choose any of
55:27
the evil stuff at all that wasn't had
55:29
nothing to do with god at all he sent us
55:31
to this earth it's an imperfect earth
55:33
there's imperfect people
55:35
everybody is held accountable for what
55:37
they did they they there there will be
55:39
an accountability uh of course when you
55:42
receive jesus christ that has something
55:44
to do with wiping that away
55:46
but i can tell you this he sent you this
55:48
is what happened he picked you for
55:50
certain things he sent you to earth at
55:53
the time he needed you to be here
55:56
he didn't choose those people to be
55:58
wicked they weren't always wicked when
55:59
they were children they weren't wicked
56:01
okay so everybody making their own
56:03
choices are raising their children
56:06
in a certain way because of what's in
56:08
them
56:09
and that's why i always i talk to young
56:11
people a lot i've done young people
56:13
meetings and i say you have to
56:14
understand that you're not just going to
56:17
be raising children one day you are
56:19
shaping souls
56:21
that came from god for his use do not be
56:24
abusive i'm i'm telling them this
56:26
already but you know what that's if they
56:28
watch a lot of violent stuff
56:30
just go into their soul and even
56:32
psychiatrists know this they don't
56:34
understand the workings of the soul or
56:36
what the soul looks like but what you
56:38
what you choose what you listen to all
56:41
the time will become a part of you what
56:43
you watch all the time would become a
56:44
part of me and eventually you might even
56:46
act out some of those things you see
56:49
and that's why there's evil satan helps
56:51
that to happen he makes sure it happen
56:54
happens and yet there's some people who
56:56
grew up in a violent household
56:59
that that never part part took of that
57:01
they they were strong they never allowed
57:03
that to affect their life or how they
57:06
lived it later and became and were
57:08
totally totally different people than
57:10
what that person was that had them so
57:12
you have to understand god didn't create
57:15
he didn't make evil happen
57:17
he didn't even make lucifer satan
57:20
if you go back that far let's go that
57:22
far he may lucifer to be an anointed
57:25
being who would help lead worship
57:27
for him to create glory for him to be a
57:30
light for him that's what that's what
57:33
lucifer's job was he made him for that
57:36
he didn't make him to be evil it says in
57:38
the bible iniquity was found in him
57:42
that was significantly because god
57:44
didn't put that in him
57:46
okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's
57:49
own thoughts and own
57:50
wicked desires to be greater than god
57:53
and want to rule
57:55
from that came evil began to be birthed
57:58
inside of him before it came out so
58:00
because there is evil
58:03
present in this world one day there
58:05
won't be any
58:07
we can look at it that way but god
58:09
didn't choose you to be tormented he
58:12
didn't choose that those people who
58:15
raised you had every right to choose to
58:17
do what was right regardless of what
58:19
within them they had every right to be
58:22
kind to you to nourish you
58:24
to nurture you and everything and know
58:26
god and no happiness and joy
58:29
and not have your mind tormented later
58:31
in your life all the things that
58:32
happened to you as a child but god
58:33
didn't create evil
58:35
in this earth
58:37
he didn't know evil would be here but he
58:40
also sent his son for the very purpose
58:42
that you could be free from anything
58:44
you went through you can be free from
58:46
any event no matter how bad it was or
58:48
when it happened you don't have to carry
58:50
that stuff on the inside of you
58:52
and that's why he came to bring freedom
58:54
in life he had an appointed time to be
58:57
here even jesus christ had to be made
59:00
into a seed this is what it says christ
59:03
was made into a seed he was made okay he
59:06
had he was going to have flesh on him
59:08
and i think on my our next um report we
59:11
do i'll actually read the poem holy
59:13
spirit gave me
59:14
about when the announcements began to
59:16
made it be made in heaven that the word
59:18
would die for us that the word would be
59:20
made flesh which it says in the bible
59:24
he was planted as a seed in the womb of
59:26
mary but there's this whole beautiful
59:28
story
59:29
it's called the year before christmas
59:32
and what literally began to happen in
59:34
heaven um you know before he was even
59:36
sent
59:37
and i'm not going to do that today but
59:39
we'll do that next week but you have to
59:41
understand god has been from the
59:42
beginning to the end and no matter what
59:44
you thought you could do that would be
59:46
better
59:48
he
59:49
has a plan
59:51
he was willing to sacrifice his own son
59:53
who was tormented and tortured and so
59:56
horribly abused wrongfully accused uh
59:59
you know unjustly treated
60:02
and and basically murdered
60:05
he knew that
60:06
his son would go through that but what
60:08
comes from that and this is the thing
60:11
you even though it's not god's intention
60:13
to make you suffer for him his son
60:16
suffered for all of us
60:18
you can take your life no matter what
60:20
you've been through and you can lose all
60:21
of that all of that horror all of that
60:23
abuse all that torment all that trauma
60:26
lucifer from your soul in jesus name and
60:28
jesus will come pull it out of you
60:30
and it will be like it didn't happen in
60:33
other words you might think about it but
60:34
there'll be no torment in it there'll be
60:36
no suffering in it
60:38
because we can be totally free
60:41
from all of the effects of evil but god
60:43
didn't make people bad he didn't make
60:46
evil itself
60:48
and the evil one who's done this will be
60:51
more tormented than anything that ever
60:53
existed throughout all the time he satan
60:57
will be more tormented than any other
60:59
anyone else who ends up in that lake of
61:01
fire
61:02
satan will be the most hated being in
61:04
there the most tormented and he will
61:06
have no
61:08
power whatsoever so you can think of
61:11
it's one thing you to be in a place of
61:14
torment but when you everyone is
61:16
tormenting that one person and they
61:17
can't escape or get away uh that is his
61:20
end he will have nothing from anything
61:23
he's done god also knows that he's a
61:26
just god
61:27
and kind loving god so you need to see
61:30
him the kind loving one who gave the
61:32
greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying
61:35
to cover up things that were done to you
61:37
my parents didn't torment me uh but i
61:40
certainly was picked on and and made fun
61:42
of most of my life growing up and i just
61:45
had to let it go i don't even know about
61:46
losing you know i decided i'm going to
61:47
let it go and go on i have stuff i have
61:50
to do and i want to see done
61:54
you have to make the same decision but
61:55
let me tell you god does know everything
61:58
and he is not it is seedtime and harvest
62:01
people this is not
62:03
don't get your 50 bottles of anointing
62:05
oil out okay because this is not the end
62:08
time harvest it talks about in the bible
62:10
before all the other stuff start to
62:12
happen we're not even ready to handle
62:14
that harvest like that okay you're going
62:16
to be powerful you're going to be filled
62:18
with god when those days come but it's a
62:21
seedtime and harvest for what you've
62:23
been planting what the left has been
62:25
planting harvest for them is about to
62:28
happen what you've been planting by
62:30
yours making a stand still filled with
62:33
life encouraging people bringing people
62:35
hope you're going to get the greatest
62:36
harvest you've seen in your life so far
62:39
this is the seedtime and harvest is
62:40
happening now just that's for free what
62:43
time is it time and harvest for us
62:46
individually for whole groups of people
62:48
if it's evil you're going to get a
62:50
harvest of justice and and probably the
62:53
rather that and
62:54
while
62:55
while you're talking
62:57
as this as we close out i know i feel
62:59
like there's some people out there that
63:00
says i wish someone would just show me
63:03
right now how to get saved i i like this
63:06
stuff
63:07
no one's ever led me to the lord how do
63:09
i do that would you
63:11
i sure would love to do that yeah
63:14
and and let me tell you it's really
63:16
uh man can come
63:18
complicate things so much sometimes we
63:21
feel like we don't read you know the the
63:23
50-page syllabus
63:25
or if we don't have someone who's like
63:27
known god forever lead you even a child
63:30
can lead someone to be born again you
63:32
make a decision in your own self that
63:35
you want jesus christ okay
63:37
you're tired of what you've been living
63:39
in you're tired of the junk going on in
63:40
this world you see no hope if you don't
63:43
have hope right now
63:44
you may not have a lot of god in you
63:47
because right now he's releasing hope in
63:49
life when you are born again
63:52
literally your your soul gets a shower
63:55
of the blood of jesus christ to wipe
63:57
away every sin you've ever committed no
64:00
matter what it is when it happened in
64:03
your life if you want to walk as
64:05
righteous if you don't have jesus christ
64:07
you're unrighteous okay you're not
64:08
counted as righteous if you want to be
64:10
counted as righteous you're going to be
64:12
part of god's plan what he has in this
64:14
earth you need to know his son jesus
64:16
christ
64:17
you first of all recognize that jesus
64:19
christ is the son of the living god he
64:22
did die for your sins and he did it
64:24
purposefully he chose to do that so the
64:27
first thing you do is repent of any sin
64:29
you've ever committed no matter when it
64:31
happened or how that happened re repent
64:34
recognize that you are a sinner and you
64:36
repent and you receive jesus christ as
64:38
your savior that's the first step that
64:41
you do that the second step is you thank
64:44
him for dying for you thank him for your
64:46
sins being forgiven and it will be like
64:50
in god's books in heaven when you
64:52
receive christ he literally will go and
64:54
wipe out in his books every sin up to
64:58
that point every one you've ever
64:59
committed will be wiped off like you
65:01
never did them that's how powerful the
65:04
blood of christ is
65:06
then you say i receive everything that
65:08
that blood affords me i receive
65:09
everything that that sacrifice that
65:12
affords me i realize now i'm part of
65:14
god's family i'm a part of his family
65:17
i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free
65:20
by grace you are a powerful born again
65:24
uh believer now jesus christ will
65:26
literally step inside of you that's what
65:28
happens he'll step inside of you
65:31
it says you invite him to live in you
65:33
and he will and then you begin to feel
65:36
his presence
65:38
miraculous things will begin to happen
65:39
because now you're carrying his presence
65:42
with you and anytime temptation comes to
65:44
you after that make sure you say no i'm
65:46
not that person anymore it says you're
65:49
born again you are a new creation and
65:52
the reason why god can say that is none
65:54
of your past sins you're not being
65:56
looked at anymore by a sinful person
65:59
you're being looked at as god's son or
66:01
his daughter whichever one he made you
66:04
and now he opens doors for you to
66:07
understand him more make sure you get a
66:08
bible i would encourage you to start
66:11
reading the new testament read the book
66:12
of john and make sure you study the book
66:14
of john as a lot about who jesus was
66:17
also talks about what what it's like to
66:19
be born again and in in there it's real
66:22
exciting and then make sure you speak to
66:24
him you need to know that prayer is very
66:27
important for you you don't just get you
66:28
know born again and now i'm saved and
66:31
live your life like he always lived it
66:33
i'm not saying you can't stay at the
66:34
same job or live in the same home you'll
66:36
have the same family but you need to
66:38
recognize now you're a new creation made
66:41
by god because of the blood of christ
66:43
you begin to seek him and what does that
66:45
mean get in a room by yourself and say
66:47
jesus christ i want to know you more i
66:49
want i want to know you i want to know
66:51
what your heart is i want to know what
66:53
your thoughts are of me and i would say
66:55
i i used to do it at one point every day
66:57
of my life i did that usually late at
66:59
night i'm not saying you have to do
67:00
anything late at night and this is the
67:02
thing some people say you have to take a
67:04
certain posture it's okay if you want to
67:06
kneel to do it you can be walking down
67:08
the street and get born again you can
67:10
get born again arriving in your car he's
67:12
looking to know you more he is seeking
67:15
you harder than you are seeking him
67:19
so the most important thing in your life
67:21
should be to receive christ and then
67:23
begin to pursue to know him more and
67:26
then you start on a whole different
67:29
journey
67:30
in your life the inside of you has
67:32
changed your spirit man god puts light
67:34
in your spirit your spirit man has light
67:37
in it it gives it more understanding it
67:39
gives you more of his presence inside of
67:41
you
67:42
your name is literally written in the
67:44
lamb's book of life he'll write it right
67:46
there at that moment that you get born
67:48
again and so powerful things happen in
67:50
the spirit when you are born again so i
67:53
would just say just you can say a simple
67:54
prayer so let's just say this you can
67:56
say
67:57
jesus christ
67:59
jesus christ
68:01
i want to receive you as my savior i
68:04
want to receive you as my savior
68:06
i recognize
68:08
we recognize
68:10
you are the son of the living god you
68:13
are the son of the living god
68:15
you came to this world to die for my
68:18
sins you came to this world to die for
68:20
my sins
68:21
so i repent of all sin so i repent of
68:24
all sin
68:26
up to this moment in my life up to this
68:28
moment in my life
68:30
i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to
68:33
wash me clean
68:35
with your blood with your blood
68:38
i receive your sacrifice i receive your
68:41
sacrifice
68:43
and i now thank you and i now thank you
68:46
for making me part of the family of god
68:49
for making me part of the family of god
68:52
i give you permission i give you
68:54

03:14
hearing all about christmas town um but
03:17
before we start do you have any current
03:19
events that you want to share with us
03:22
i just want to say some of the greatest
03:24
things ever about to happen people
03:27
um you know i can share but not share
03:29
all of it i just know that things are
03:31
rumbling
03:32
in the undergrounds not just the
03:34
earthquakes but uh behind the scenes and
03:38
then covert places the solicitor's
03:40
covert
03:42
i can just tell you the new norm will be
03:44
better than what it was before people
03:46
it's not gonna we're not gonna be
03:47
controlled it's not gonna be a time of
03:49
sorrows we are not entering into the
03:52
perilous times we have way too much
03:54
stuff to do in this earth for jesus
03:55
christ and of course you know this show
03:58
highlights him also but it highlights
04:01
one of his best friends in heaven his
04:02
name would be nicholas so that's about
04:05
it let's just get going with those
04:06
questions
04:07
yes awesome so the first the first thing
04:11
i want you to just tell like a brief um
04:14
a little bit about what where christmas
04:16
tower is and what is christmas town for
04:18
the people who haven't heard you talk
04:20
about it before
04:21
christmas town is actually a place in
04:24
heaven
04:25
and for those who don't know me um
04:27
you you may not be able to
04:29
wrap your natural mind around anything
04:31
that i say because it comes by
04:33
revelation
04:34
revelation comes from the heart of the
04:36
father it's not man's thoughts man's
04:38
ideas are man's plans
04:40
it's god's and so i've been taking on
04:44
tours of heaven not just once but many
04:46
times and before you start you know
04:48
beating me up i forgive you i forgive
04:50
everybody out there so don't waste your
04:52
time doing that i have too much of a
04:54
life to live for jesus christ
04:56
but i do want to say this years ago
05:00
kenneth hagin senior has somebody
05:02
working for him who actually still on
05:03
this earth her name is billy brim
05:06
and um and he would tell billy brim
05:09
before these days are over
05:11
uh things that will begin to happen he
05:14
said i won't be here this kenneth hagin
05:15
senior speaking to billy brim who worked
05:17
for him okay
05:19
and uh and he said to her before these
05:21
days are all over something great will
05:23
begin to happen god will begin to catch
05:26
people up to heaven and taking them on
05:27
tours
05:29
really those are his words and then
05:31
bringing them back to earth this is
05:33
without dying so they can share
05:35
revelation about heaven and that he said
05:37
that to billy brim and when she found
05:40
out about me she was so excited she
05:42
called me i sent her my first book i
05:44
think i sent her the second book too and
05:47
she said she knew this was true because
05:49
years ago kenneth hagin senior who's now
05:51
in heaven uh had told her this would
05:54
happen and she saw that i was taken on
05:56
tours continually she knew that was the
05:58
truth so there's somebody right there
06:00
who's an eyewitness
06:01
that god had this plane all along i just
06:04
happened to be one of those people i've
06:06
been taking in many places in heaven
06:07
over the last 20 some years and i was
06:10
taken to exciting profound places that
06:13
were so filled with awe and wonder but
06:16
has also taken places to have fun
06:20
and the father said to me why would i
06:22
not have fun if i said in my word you
06:24
know you must come like a little child
06:27
he said i'd be in a lot of trouble if i
06:28
didn't have fun places for people who
06:30
are like little kids to play in and one
06:33
of the places i was taken to
06:36
is a place in heaven where it snows all
06:38
the time now i know a lot of people are
06:40
going to love this more will love it
06:42
than not
06:43
it snows all the time but you have to
06:45
remember i'm talking about heaven not
06:47
the earth the snow is alive
06:50
everything in heaven has life the plants
06:53
sing the plants talk the birds the
06:55
creatures even the buildings shout out
06:58
the ground shouts out all the time and
07:00
worships jesus christ they have a place
07:02
called the friendly forest you can go
07:03
and have conversations with trees with
07:05
the rocks uh with the creatures there's
07:08
so much life there you can't escape it
07:09
so i hope that under makes you
07:11
understand
07:12
in in christmas time when you go there
07:14
that is where nicholas lives
07:17
yes nick some people call him saint nick
07:19
some people come saying you call them
07:20
whatever his actual name is nicholas and
07:23
god created a place he knew one day so
07:27
this place has been around don't go into
07:29
the druids and all the stuff that it's a
07:31
bad place and it's part of this thing
07:33
this thing i'm sorry but god was there
07:35
heaven was there before anybody was born
07:37
on the earth he had places already
07:40
planned in heaven that he knew that we
07:42
would love to come there and he knew
07:44
people would come home and use their
07:45
gifts in heaven which is what you do
07:48
so nicholas had a place all prepared for
07:51
him when he passed to come nicholas
07:54
lived in the 3rd century i think 270 a.d
07:57
that's really close you know it's only
07:59
270 years after christ died so everybody
08:02
was still talking about him knew about
08:04
him in those days but of course you know
08:06
our enemy satan wasn't happy about that
08:08
so he'd always send people out into the
08:10
crowds into places to talk against
08:13
the deity and the person of jesus christ
08:16
so nicholas was actually this is the
08:18
person who people then made him become
08:20
like santa claus he actually was a very
08:23
wealthy person he lived in turkey you
08:25
can look all this up even i think
08:26
wikipedia talks about it he lived in
08:29
turkey and uh he would offender of the
08:31
faith and i think he was even a bishop
08:34
but he was very fierce when people would
08:36
attack the person of jesus christ or
08:38
speak against who he was
08:40
he had a staff he would use that staff
08:42
for things other than leading his sleigh
08:45
how about that people he actually had a
08:47
sleigh he would take gifts to children
08:50
he used to set them outside their home
08:52
at that certain time of the year and
08:54
then thieves would begin to come by and
08:56
get it so he is the one who actually
08:58
started the whole stocking thing the
09:00
parents would hang stockings inside and
09:02
nicholas would come by and leave gifts
09:04
for them this is the truth i'm telling
09:06
you and so all that came the wonderful
09:09
story we have now but i do want to say
09:12
this he lives there he loves the snow
09:14
it's known where he lived on earth
09:16
and so god created this beautiful place
09:18
when you make a snowman in christmas
09:20
town in heaven it is alive so i kind of
09:23
want some of the christmas songs and the
09:25
things that they say
09:27
uh your sleigh can go through through
09:29
the air it can go on the ground uh
09:31
there's all kinds of things to enjoy
09:33
there ice skating and i i learned from
09:36
the father that our seasons on the earth
09:40
are here there's four main seasons
09:42
and we know that there's winter summer
09:44
spring and fall
09:46
and god said i took a a shadow of an
09:49
actual place
09:51
that existed in heaven i took a shadow
09:53
of it and made it a season on the earth
09:56
so that's one of the reasons why we have
09:58
snow on the earth because it is in
10:00
heaven it was there first and so he made
10:02
this beautiful place it's like this
10:04
beautiful village and everybody goes
10:06
there with their families who are in
10:08
heaven and yes everybody gives gifts but
10:11
then excuse me the main thing they do in
10:13
christmas town is they celebrate the
10:16
birth of jesus christ
10:18
it's like happy birthday all the time in
10:20
heaven because people go to there to see
10:22
sometimes jesus will show up and people
10:24
will bring him gifts they pile gifts
10:26
gifts you know at a place for him
10:28
but they get gifts before they leave
10:30
christmas town because they're huge
10:32
trees in christmas town and all the
10:35
lights on the trees are baby stars
10:38
like that he plucked out of the sky put
10:40
them on the trees and they all sing
10:42
worship music to jesus but they also
10:44
sing christmas songs
10:46
so this is a delightful place that the
10:49
kids will love to go but even big kids
10:51
you know parents and whole families go
10:53
to this beautiful place and they really
10:56
enjoy it
10:57
so that's where nicholas lives he made
10:59
this place where nicholas has a shop
11:03
he still makes toys
11:04
and my brother recently passed and he
11:06
used to say all the time when i get to
11:08
heaven one day i'll work with saint
11:09
nipple guess what he does
11:14
my brother would create toys on the
11:15
earth every single christmas he would
11:18
dress to santa claus he would go give
11:19
gifts away he'd visit places to be be
11:22
that person of course the honor of jesus
11:24
christ in his heart more than anything
11:26
else and i want you to know
11:28
nicholas himself loves jesus christ and
11:31
that's why therefore the shirt you know
11:33
here's a shirt right here with santa and
11:36
having doing selfies with jesus
11:41
and so people people just love some
11:43
people live in christmas town i mean
11:45
that's where their mansions are and so
11:47
it's a really fun exciting place to be
11:50
wow that's so awesome i can't wait to go
11:54
and see that myself and all the all the
11:57
kids questions um i asked i even asked
12:00
my daughter this morning i knew i was
12:01
coming on with you and i i said to her
12:03
her name's lily and i said lily if
12:05
there's one question you could ask what
12:07
would you want to ask and she thought
12:09
for a while she had a couple questions
12:11
but um michael could you pull up i i put
12:14
a little video of her asking you uh can
12:17
we pull that up
12:19
hey mrs cat um where where is eva's
12:22
favorite place to go in heaven
12:25
jesus's favorite place to go in heaven
12:28
would be christmas town
12:32
it really is he visits here a lot
12:35
he actually makes toys with nicholas he
12:39
goes to his shop because you have to
12:40
remember
12:42
jesus was a carpenter on the earth uh
12:44
when he actually walked on the earth and
12:47
people go well he built houses he built
12:49
furniture he made toys too
12:51
uh jesus loved children you could see
12:54
all through the new testament that he
12:55
would be with the little children he
12:57
said don't keep them from coming to me
12:59
he loved he loved to talk with him and
13:01
play with them but he would make toys
13:02
for them too so guess what he's using
13:04
his gift he had on the earth in heaven
13:08
he also loves the snow he loves the
13:10
beauty of it
13:11
and everyone loves to see him and they
13:15
all run want to run up and hug jesus and
13:17
guess what they take pictures with him
13:18
in heaven how about that
13:20
uh they do have a way to do that you
13:22
think people are taking pictures down to
13:23
earth where do you get to heaven one day
13:25
so i would say definitely christmas town
13:28
is one of his most favorite places
13:30
oh she's gonna love that um and
13:34
annabelle is eight she's nine years old
13:36
and she wants to know if you paint a
13:38
picture in heaven can you hop right into
13:42
it and does it become real
13:46
that's what i remember some of the
13:47
movies on the years that were made
13:49
people need to understand all those
13:50
great movies the decent fun ones
13:54
a lot of those places are in heaven i'm
13:57
not going to give you a list of some of
13:58
those movies but but we all know that
14:01
there is one that shows something like
14:02
that happen there's so much creativity
14:06
and as i said everything alive is in
14:07
heaven just to give you another idea uh
14:10
there's a whole place called the
14:11
galleria where all the artists come now
14:13
people would think oh you know that
14:14
would be like rembrandt or somebody like
14:17
that no anybody in heaven who has a gift
14:19
you paint or loves to paint there's even
14:22
a whole section for children
14:24
and what they paint does come to life
14:27
now before you think in your natural
14:29
earth head there's nothing wicked
14:32
there's no bad there's no witchcraft no
14:34
darkness no evil none of that is in
14:36
anything anyone does in heaven it
14:38
doesn't even exist there so your
14:40
thoughts your creativity is not ever
14:42
tied to the darkness so you understand
14:44
that but fun excitement you know those
14:48
type of things definitely yes your art
14:50
would come alive but not only does it
14:52
come alive there if you are an artist in
14:55
heaven you have a gallery of your own
14:57
you have a studio that's part of your
14:59
mansion people come to get the art you
15:02
create and you give it away now when
15:04
they take that art home and hang it on
15:06
the wall guess what it comes alive
15:09
oh my god so so she actually thought of
15:13
something that really does happen in
15:16
heaven not just in the galleria area
15:18
where all the artists come but in
15:20
anybody's home they'll come by no matter
15:22
what you create or make that's your gift
15:24
you give it away there's no money
15:26
everything is given freely but how
15:28
delightful for somebody maybe sees a
15:31
magnificent
15:32
horse picture and they take it home and
15:33
hang out and all of a sudden that horse
15:34
is galloping in the picture
15:37
so yes that is exactly true it does come
15:39
alive and not only can you jump into
15:41
your art
15:43
there's a place called cartoon village
15:45
in heaven that he also made for children
15:48
and when you go there you can create
15:49
cartoon of movies with your friends and
15:51
then you become a cartoon and you jump
15:54
in the movie the cartoon and all your
15:56
friends can come and see and watch it
15:58
and when it's over you step back up and
16:00
then you're you again
16:01
so i'm telling you people that think
16:03
kevin is boring they don't know very
16:05
much about it so you were absolutely
16:07
right yes you can jump into your artwork
16:10
and then you're there in the art
16:13
wow oh that's exciting annabelle i know
16:15
you're going to be excited about that so
16:17
think about what you're going to draw
16:19
when you get there annabelle because
16:20
you're going to be able to to be part of
16:22
it
16:23
okay the next question is from
16:25
evangeline and she's four years old and
16:28
she says can i have a rainbow house with
16:31
rainbow things in heaven
16:34
hi evangeline of course you can it is
16:37
heaven
16:38
um mansions are made out of almost
16:41
anything that you can think of but
16:42
totally that rainbow comes from the
16:45
father it's living it moves in and out
16:47
it's on a lot of places in heaven you
16:50
yourself can become rainbow color if you
16:52
want to
16:53
the clothing you wear changes color so
16:56
why wouldn't you be able to have a
16:57
rainbow house i would say yes that would
17:00
definitely be a yes
17:02
oh that's that's exciting my daughter's
17:04
gonna love that too evangeline because
17:06
she always talks about i want to ride on
17:08
the rainbow i want to slide on the
17:10
rainbow and i think i've said in heaven
17:13
i bet you can that's always how i answer
17:15
in heaven you can and then michael is
17:18
age eight this is my son and i asked him
17:21
to ask you a question and he said can i
17:23
have a house made out of candy
17:26
oh no everybody every child wants their
17:30
house made out candy and the best part
17:32
is you can eat it and it comes right
17:34
back uh because it's heaven
17:37
there's a whole place called jello land
17:40
in heaven it really does exist and then
17:42
part of that land of course there's
17:44
there's houses made out of candy they're
17:46
made out of all kinds of things uh
17:49
flowers a whole house made out of
17:50
flowers and they sing to you all the
17:52
time when you come to your mansion and
17:55
uh but candy is one of the most favorite
17:57
things i know there's chocolate
17:58
waterfalls probably would be a part of
18:00
that mansion made out of candy uh you
18:03
can just go jump out in the waterfall
18:04
and drink the chocolate or swim in the
18:06
chocolate and so yes and in the jello
18:09
lamb part of it people will reach out
18:10
and they'll take you know a bite of the
18:12
house or take a handful the house need
18:13
it then it comes right back
18:15
you can bounce in the jello land houses
18:18
also and uh but the candy house i think
18:21
is a great idea it makes me think of
18:22
that game candy land
18:24
so let me tell you i will say this jesus
18:27
christ
18:29
does have a soft part in his heart for
18:32
sweets he loves sweets and so he'd
18:35
probably be right there with you you
18:36
know tasting the chocolate or the candy
18:38
canes or whatever else was made your
18:40
house was made out of so the answer is
18:42
absolutely yes you could have a house
18:44
made out of candy
18:46
oh well he's gonna be really excited
18:48
about that because that is his question
18:49
he's asked me many times cat he said do
18:52
you think i can have a candy house and i
18:54
said well with the lord all things are
18:56
possible so i'm sure yes you can
18:59
yes that's absolutely true
19:01
now we're gonna we're gonna move uh now
19:03
to questions from adults so they're a
19:06
little different than the kids questions
19:08
i have i have noticed that um so the
19:10
first question is from illumination and
19:13
she actually um is behind the scenes
19:16
here and she wants to know my grandma
19:19
went to heaven in 2019 and she
19:21
absolutely loves christmas even her
19:24
memorial service was christmas themed is
19:27
it possible that jesus would give her a
19:29
home in christmas town because she loved
19:31
it so much on earth
19:33
i'm sure he had started building it your
19:36
your mansion gets started being built
19:38
when you're born
19:40
uh when you're born he starts working on
19:42
okay now in heaven there's no time so
19:44
it's not like wow was that 10 years 20
19:46
30 40 50 years
19:48
and usually he times you're coming home
19:50
to heaven with your mansion being done
19:53
so i promise you he already knew what
19:55
she loved you know he sees and hears us
19:57
on the earth i assure you that he had
20:00
already built that house in christmas
20:02
town knowing her love for that so
20:04
if you want to visit her when you get to
20:05
heaven you will be going to christmas
20:07
town probably going on sleigh rides she
20:09
might come to your mention and pick you
20:11
up in the sleigh and then you can go see
20:13
her mansion a lot of that type of things
20:15
happens in heaven so
20:17
i'm sure yes that she lives in christmas
20:20
town
20:21
oh that's awesome well there you go
20:23
elimination she we talked a little bit
20:25
behind the scenes and she said i feel
20:26
like the answer is yes but i i just want
20:28
to hear from cat what what she has to
20:30
say about it so paulette is our next
20:33
question and paulette um asks does
20:36
heaven celebrate jesus's
20:38
earthly birthday
20:40
yes
20:43
can i hold up something you can zoom in
20:45
on it and i'm just gonna show them this
20:47
is a new product not we've already been
20:49
selling about a hundred so it's not
20:51
about buying it but i want to show you
20:53
uh how much they celebrate the birth of
20:56
christ this is a scene i actually saw in
20:58
heaven now this is part of the scene i
21:00
might show you the artwork for the rest
21:02
of it in a minute but this is a scene in
21:04
heaven of a little girl uh who lives in
21:07
heaven and she's riding on a sled with
21:10
the snowman she built
21:12
on the front of the sled actually says
21:14
happy birthday jesus because i had
21:16
already said that everybody celebrates
21:18
the birth of christ in heaven and so
21:20
here they are on their slide you might
21:22
have to tell me if i can can you see it
21:25
yes
21:26
can you see the little the girl the
21:28
snowman her pet
21:31
is also there and there it says at the
21:33
bottom happy birthday jesus
21:36
so yes they do celebrate the birth of
21:39
christ in christmastown
21:41
and uh and everybody loves to come
21:43
there's one of the reasons they actually
21:45
do come there they all sing happy
21:46
birthday to him they have non-stop cake
21:50
people
21:54
was gonna get cake in christmas town and
21:57
hot chocolate you know and
21:59
and other things like that you're
22:00
definitely going to experience that but
22:02
but it is the number one place people
22:04
would think it would be some other place
22:06
maybe religious place but nope this is
22:09
where he chooses and i know people it
22:12
may not have been exactly december 25th
22:14
but he loves for people to celebrate his
22:16
birthday and also created christmas
22:19
towns so people would be able to go
22:20
there to do that
22:21
[Music]
22:22
and in christmas town today is there um
22:25
a big christmas dinner
22:27
uh constance wants to know this and it
22:29
kind of links with the last question is
22:31
there a big christmas dinner in heaven
22:34
for christmas
22:36
and
22:39
why do you um we do it on the earth
22:43
many of the things we actually do and
22:45
the holidays we celebrate they already
22:47
celebrate those in heaven
22:49
and absolutely you're going to eat and
22:52
people can eat all they want to there's
22:53
no weight gain no no allergies no food
22:56
allergies
22:57
and so absolutely how would that be to
22:59
celebrate during that time what what
23:01
represents the time of the year why
23:03
would there not be a feast yes there is
23:06
definitely a big feast the good part is
23:09
this no animals life is taken
23:12
god makes all the food out of light but
23:14
it tastes like turkey it tastes like it
23:17
tastes like ham it tastes like pie
23:18
whatever you love to eat but they
23:21
certainly have a a non an ongoing feast
23:25
in christmas town
23:27
wow that's awesome i can't wait to eat
23:30
in heaven i know i've heard you talk
23:31
about it before
23:33
about how big also isn't the food really
23:36
big in size there oh yes like the pizza
23:39
place that was taken to a place called
23:41
pizza joe's in heaven
23:43
and the pizzas were the size of the
23:46
table it was sitting on now this was a
23:49
round table
23:50
this round table will seat about eight
23:52
people now when i say the word table
23:54
don't think i'm talking about just a
23:55
normal table that's not like that it's
23:58
filled with light and you have like your
24:01
your plate or you can eat on slides out
24:03
in front of you
24:04
and then you just point you you eat a
24:06
slice of pizza it's about this big i
24:08
can't even get it i can't even get it
24:11
the pizza slice is so big you have to
24:14
hold it with both hands to eat it it was
24:16
the best tasting pizza i had ever had in
24:19
my life and right next to that is an
24:21
italian restaurant where the meatballs
24:24
are like
24:25
[Laughter]
24:29
and the guy who the guy who has that he
24:32
had an italian restaurant on the earth
24:34
it was his gift he loved to cook for
24:35
people
24:36
he has a chef's hat on he has one of
24:38
those handlebar mustaches and
24:41
he's really really happy person so yeah
24:43
i've been to like an italian restaurant
24:45
the ice cream parlor oh my goodness the
24:49
the scoops are this big of the ice cream
24:52
and you can even create your own kind of
24:54
ice cream in this ice cream shop and
24:56
then they change and they add a name to
24:58
the um the menu up there what you can
25:01
order and you can you can name the ice
25:02
cream yourself
25:04
wow that's so awesome
25:07
and i know i i love to bake so i'm a big
25:10
baker and i thought when you talked
25:12
about christmas town how the artists
25:14
where um they give away their paintings
25:16
is it the same with bakeries like we can
25:18
make really huge christmas cookies and
25:20
then give them away to all our neighbors
25:23
oh yes you can they'll probably be lined
25:25
up outside
25:29
you can give away your baked goods and i
25:31
know people they say i don't know what
25:33
my gift is and yet oh my word they like
25:35
to make the best brownies on the earth
25:37
and when are you kidding it's going to
25:39
be making brownies you know they love to
25:41
do it they love to give them away as
25:42
gifts
25:44
uh people who are blessed on the earth
25:45
are the ones who who get to operate in
25:47
their gift now
25:49
and so uh they they're used to do that
25:51
but in heaven nobody misses their true
25:53
destiny
25:54
god sent us all as a gift with a gift it
25:58
wasn't not talking about a spiritual
25:59
group talk about a natural gift that
26:01
everybody can enjoy
26:03
and uh and we know people who sing
26:05
they're singing amazing that's their
26:07
gift people in sports they play really
26:08
well that's their gift but there's a lot
26:10
of other gifts gifts there's like design
26:13
you know or baking i can tell you that
26:16
that food and baking and stuff like that
26:18
is considered an art in heaven
26:23
that's awesome
26:24
i can't wait to bake and and i bet the
26:26
the machinery there is like incredible
26:29
too
26:30
like
26:31
huge mixers times 10.
26:34
yes it's incred the thing is is now
26:36
if you want to have a bakery that will
26:39
be part of your mansion you don't have a
26:41
place where you live in a place where
26:42
you work and it's not work when you love
26:45
it right
26:46
so you would go to your mansion to visit
26:48
your bakery and all your good you'd have
26:51
a showroom with all the food there you
26:53
had made and yes they do have kitchens
26:55
in heaven if you want one now if you're
26:58
gonna be a baker you're gonna have to
26:59
have a kitchen you probably have people
27:01
a sign that that's their gift is to help
27:03
in that um unless it's one of the little
27:06
tiny angels that looks sort of like an
27:08
elf and i'm just gonna get bash for that
27:10
but i don't care uh there are ones that
27:12
you have little helpers assigned in
27:14
heaven if you have a bakery because you
27:15
know you know if you got a half a
27:17
million people coming to get your goods
27:18
you need help
27:20
yes
27:21
and so it's a whole different life
27:24
because i've seen the kitchen of someone
27:26
who loved to feed people her dining room
27:29
seated 100 people and it was a dining
27:31
room in her mansion and in her kitchen
27:33
had such high tech i didn't even know
27:36
what some of the stuff was this is one
27:38
of the best parts about heaven if you
27:39
choose to cook i saw this woman making a
27:42
massive salad that was going to be
27:44
served
27:45
to all of her guests and she was peeling
27:47
like a cucumber and as she peeled it in
27:49
the in the and it came off of the
27:51
cucumber it disappeared there's no waste
27:54
there's no trash there's no cleanup how
27:57
about that isn't that awesome hallelujah
28:01
there's no cleanup no garbage to take
28:03
out people there's there's no waste
28:04
dumps and having to leave stuff
28:07
it just disappears and um
28:10
that's like back to the waterfall
28:11
chocolate waterfalls you can get in and
28:13
swim around you have chocolate all over
28:15
you but when you step out of it it's
28:16
gone
28:18
so but the food thing in heaven just
28:20
amazed me that everything you eat is
28:22
made out of life but your substance i
28:24
know people think well light is
28:26
something you can't really touch or feel
28:28
and heaven it is it's the number one
28:30
thing that things are made out of in
28:32
heaven actually your spirit man is made
28:34
out of light but you don't float around
28:36
like a little cloud in heaven you walk
28:38
on the streets you use your stuff in
28:40
your mansion you ride the horses uh it's
28:43
an actual life it's a literal life in
28:46
heaven
28:47
wow that's awesome well i'm excited to
28:50
go and cook in heaven i'm telling you
28:52
that i've had that deep within me where
28:54
i'm like i can't wait to cook and bake
28:56
and give away my stuff in heaven because
28:58
that is your visit your place yes
29:01
please do please everybody come visit me
29:04
please okay
29:05
um
29:06
elaine elaine wants to know can you
29:08
describe how jesus became a seed and was
29:12
planted in the womb of young mary
29:15
that's awesome
29:17
there's actually a story the holy spirit
29:19
told me one time
29:20
it's called twas the year before
29:22
christmas
29:24
and i'm just going to share a little
29:25
part of it i'll probably have it printed
29:27
out later on there but it starts like
29:29
twas the year before christmas when all
29:32
through father's house every creature
29:34
was stirring yes even the mouse
29:37
there was so much activity like uh maybe
29:41
um earth time a year before that when it
29:44
was being announced that the word
29:47
who was christ in heaven the word was
29:49
going to be sent to earth as a baby to
29:52
be raised up to walk among the people
29:55
here
29:56
and then one day would give himself for
29:58
them so
30:00
i don't know if people even think about
30:02
this they think well they're just
30:03
supernatural they just fly around do
30:05
whatever they want to do oh no there's
30:06
much planning in heaven and explaining
30:09
in heaven because you have to understand
30:11
the angels were there long before we
30:14
were put on the earth
30:16
and so there was all kinds of activity
30:18
in heaven all the time they'd be sent on
30:19
assignments places throughout the cosmos
30:22
and
30:23
things so much activity going on in
30:25
heaven
30:26
because people were on the earth you
30:28
know people were living on the earth at
30:29
the time christ was born and so the
30:32
father had to take the word and explain
30:34
to him this is the plan this is the plan
30:38
i have for you
30:39
you will have flesh on you number one
30:41
the word was all spirit but like i
30:43
explained in heaven that's like a whole
30:45
different realm the spiritual realm to a
30:48
spiritual person would be literal like
30:50
i'm touching this like i'm holding this
30:53
cup right here see in heaven if you had
30:55
something to drink uh you would also
30:58
touch the cup and drink out of it even
31:00
though it's a spiritual world uh it
31:03
still had life and activity and there
31:05
was building going on plans being made
31:08
talking about people who had just come
31:09
home to heaven people getting to greet
31:11
them so but heaven does like to have a
31:14
lot of celebrations so this was a
31:16
different time when the father called
31:18
the word to see him and explained to him
31:21
talked to him he said would you be
31:22
willing to do this he asked him we know
31:25
it was it was at that time it was a
31:27
father the word and holy spirit
31:31
and when the father would want to create
31:33
something when there was nothing he
31:35
would go somewhere where there was
31:36
nothing he would speak what he wanted
31:38
the word would step out of him
31:40
and you have to understand in the
31:42
spiritual world the father the father
31:44
son holy spirit can step inside of each
31:46
other that's what makes them one the
31:48
three in one
31:50
so they would go places together and i'm
31:52
thinking the word probably thought oh
31:53
we're going to go create something but
31:55
the father took him aside and explained
31:56
to him it's time now
31:59
for hope to come to the earth
32:02
and therefore my plan is to send you
32:05
as a baby to be a baby on you to be
32:08
raised by a wonderful mom
32:10
and then one day you would grow up and
32:12
then you would give yourself
32:14
for the sins of the world
32:16
and i'm quite sure because i know we
32:18
think well they know everything the
32:20
father really does know everything
32:21
because everything comes from him
32:24
and this was his plan for man to help
32:26
man to help man on the earth they needed
32:28
help okay uh the enemy who satan was
32:31
wreaking havoc everywhere he was just
32:33
getting people to fall into darkness and
32:36
the answer was to send the light of the
32:38
world which was jesus christ so he did
32:40
explain to him he said i will take you
32:43
and i will make you into a seed and holy
32:45
spirit will take you down to the earth
32:47
hover over mary and plant you in the
32:50
womb of mary
32:52
and i know people don't think about this
32:54
too much when they just read the word
32:55
but you should really study the word
32:58
it says in there that he was planted in
33:00
this as a seed in mary and later because
33:03
we know man carries a seed i won't get
33:05
into all that normally the man carries a
33:07
seed and then you get married then you
33:08
have children but this was totally
33:10
different
33:11
uh this was a supernatural divine thing
33:14
that happened that the father
33:16
took the word who was his son made him
33:18
into a seed the holy spirit hovered over
33:20
the womb of mary and even talks about it
33:22
in the bible and then she he was he was
33:24
planted as a seed grew up in mary was
33:28
burst into the earth as a real being he
33:30
had flesh on him okay
33:33
why did he have to have flesh so that
33:34
people could see him because on the
33:37
earth normally you don't see spiritual
33:39
beings unless god opens your eyes to
33:41
that spirit realm which is also all
33:43
around us so he had to explain not only
33:46
to him what he was going to do he had to
33:48
take all the tribes of angels and
33:50
explain to them this is what is going to
33:52
happen
33:53
it's going to be different now it'll be
33:55
different because redemption is coming
33:57
to mankind the word has said yes he's
34:00
willing to do this
34:01
and then he will be known on the earth
34:03
as my son who one day will give himself
34:06
they were totally they were undone
34:09
because this was something that had
34:10
never happened before
34:12
i know when new things happen on the
34:14
earth people think oh that couldn't
34:15
happen or that won't happen but you know
34:17
heaven has been through many things like
34:18
we have there was even there was kind of
34:21
war one time in heaven that was when
34:22
satan tried to take over and he was
34:24
kicked out in a lightning bolt
34:26
uh so they've experienced that all of
34:28
that happening so this was new news even
34:31
for them a new revelation so now the
34:33
word was being sent to the earth
34:35
would be not not recognized on the earth
34:38
because when he was the word he was a
34:39
spiritual body and he's going to have
34:42
flesh on him so he'll look different and
34:44
they could watch from having to see
34:45
everything going on
34:46
so yes on that beautiful morning
34:50
nine months after the holy spirit
34:51
hovered over mary and planted that seed
34:54
uh jesus christ and then he was born
34:57
into this earth such a celebration in
34:59
heaven took place um that the host came
35:02
in saying to the shepherds gabriel came
35:04
to announce his birth
35:06
i'm sure there was quite a sight uh you
35:09
know here on the earth to see this all
35:11
this activity going on it was very major
35:14
for the father to give his son as a gift
35:17
to this world
35:19
and that's why god loves it when we give
35:21
gifts just so you realize
35:23
christmas time on the earth is so
35:25
precious to god it represents us loving
35:27
one another giving gifts to each other
35:30
helping each other you know making a
35:31
difference bringing hope when christ
35:33
came
35:34
as that child he began to bring hope to
35:36
people
35:37
everything was going to change about
35:40
when you pass from this earth you could
35:42
go back home to heaven having received
35:45
christ as your savior so this is one of
35:46
the best gifts ever given to the earth
35:49
would be
35:50
jesus christ the son of the living god
35:52
and he was raised just like you and i
35:55
had to be a little baby learn to walk
35:57
and learn to read and write and i do
36:00
know this about jesus he loved reading
36:03
when he was being schooled on the earth
36:04
he didn't care too much about writing
36:07
and i love the holy spirit he said
36:08
that's why there's only 10 commandments
36:10
instead of 20 because he didn't care too
36:12
much about writing that's a joke in case
36:14
you didn't get it
36:16
so anyway the star coming several years
36:19
before the birth of christ that the wise
36:21
men came across the deserts
36:23
and some people see them in a little
36:25
play here's the three kings they were
36:27
from different countries they saw the
36:30
star of christ in the east so they
36:32
traveled east from the desert regions
36:34
from three different countries it took
36:36
them two years to cross those deserts to
36:39
come and bring the gifts to
36:41
to to jesus and i don't know that he was
36:43
living in the manger at that time they
36:45
did come to honor him recognize who he
36:47
was so even people on in other countries
36:50
knew something special had happened
36:53
and so from that point on jesus lived
36:56
his life walked out his life on this
36:57
earth so that he could become our
37:00
sacrifice and what he was doing was
37:02
making a way back to the father so i
37:05
will say this the day you pass and you
37:08
step out of this body and you're going
37:10
home to heaven jesus will come get you
37:12
he's the one who walks you up the steps
37:14
of the throne and says look father your
37:17
if your son or daughter your son or your
37:19
daughter whichever one is has come home
37:21
to you
37:22
that's part of the blessing that christ
37:25
gets for having given himself for so but
37:28
it was all a stir in heaven all these
37:30
people these these creatures and these
37:33
angels and the host of heaven the army
37:35
they were all talking back and forth
37:36
non-stop did you hear the words going to
37:38
go to earth did you hear he's going to
37:40
be a baby uh that sounds to them that
37:42
was like sort of wild but they knew when
37:44
the father said something it was going
37:46
to happen
37:47
so all of heaven prepared for this to
37:49
happen things were repaired on the earth
37:51
people were put in place there would be
37:54
a part of this whole story of his birth
37:56
how they had to travel they were told
37:58
they had to travel to uh you know be
38:00
accountable for who they were and
38:01
register
38:03
and that happened to be in bethlehem how
38:05
about that and god had already placed
38:07
his star in the heavens to be seen
38:10
uh two years before this happened so
38:12
that's the true story of why we
38:15
celebrate this time of the year is
38:17
because we celebrate the birth of jesus
38:20
christ who came for us because he loved
38:22
us the father loved us
38:25
the holy spirit loved us and this is
38:27
their plan
38:28
for you for i for every person in the
38:30
earth god desires that none should
38:32
perish but you have to choose jesus
38:34
christ to live in this beautiful place
38:36
this world called heaven that is the
38:39
father's house
38:42
that's beautiful when you talk about
38:45
jesus walking us up the stairs back to
38:47
the father
38:50
i mean that
38:51
touches my heart so deeply because it's
38:54
i can just imagine that and the beauty
38:57
of
38:58
seeing the father and just the love that
39:01
must come and
39:03
washed over you as you're with
39:05
jesus and seeing the thought oh i just
39:08
can't wait for that day
39:09
oh you're already undone
39:12
that
39:13
that jesus christ
39:14
is with you
39:16
you hear about him people have
39:18
encounters sometimes i already got the
39:19
spirit of god all over me right now
39:21
you hear stories of people encountering
39:23
him on the earth and i can say i have
39:26
seen him many times but it is never
39:29
normal i'm so undone every time consumed
39:32
by the love that just comes from him it
39:35
it just permeates every part of your
39:37
body and you forget about every care you
39:39
have you're not you're not listening so
39:41
much to all the stuff going on right now
39:43
in this world god has a plan for this
39:45
world okay it says the earth is the
39:48
lord's and the fullness thereof this
39:50
earth belongs to jesus christ he paid a
39:52
price for it and he knows what's going
39:54
on let me tell you there's stuff that's
39:56
going to be exposed i can just say get
39:58
ready for some great great days ahead no
40:00
matter what the enemy thinks they're
40:02
going to do god has a plan to be in some
40:04
of the greatest days if you're young you
40:06
have the most powerful amazing future
40:09
ever on the earth to do great things for
40:11
him the creativity will be so powerful
40:14
and amazing people will be shocked some
40:16
of the stuff will be created on the
40:17
earth to help us our life to be better
40:20
and and happier but the number one thing
40:22
that will happen is the presence of the
40:25
lord is about to consume this whole
40:27
earth and the knowledge of that glory
40:30
will be seen and known all over the
40:31
earth
40:33
hallelujah i feel i feel that so strong
40:36
when you talk about that it's it's going
40:38
to be an awesome time it's awesome time
40:41
to be alive
40:42
uh there was some there's someone who
40:44
asked a question about i wanted to find
40:47
it real quick because they asked about
40:48
the oh the shepherds here we go sally
40:51
asked about um what happened to the
40:54
shepherds to whom the angels appeared
40:57
30 years later did they connect with
41:00
jesus um the baby they had seen or did
41:03
they always wonder what happened to that
41:06
baby have you seen any of those
41:08
shepherds in heaven
41:10
um i'm sure the shepherds made it happen
41:13
i will tell you this they never forgot
41:16
what they saw
41:17
i mean here is one of the one one of the
41:19
archangels appearing and gabriel is
41:21
beautiful he's so glorious i'm sure the
41:24
sky lit up you know the sky open person
41:28
lit up and here he's given this glorious
41:30
announcement you know that this messiah
41:33
is being born the son of god has come to
41:35
be amongst mankind and i can tell you
41:38
that i will say this too that where it
41:40
talks about the great host appeared the
41:42
ones that sang were actually part of the
41:44
army of heaven okay
41:47
and you know it says in the bible that
41:48
the shepherds were afraid they were so
41:50
afraid that their body hurt now they
41:52
weren't going to be hurt but they'd
41:53
never seen anything like this so you can
41:55
imagine warring angels coming with
41:58
gabriel to sing and to glorify christ's
42:00
birth on the earth that's actually what
42:03
actually happened and so they were
42:05
singing i'm sure it was really loud but
42:07
it was beautiful and so you think you
42:10
saw just one angel you'd never forget it
42:12
but here you've seen multitudes of the
42:15
these armies of heaven and gabriel
42:17
and the seraphim probably were there
42:19
singing their heads are like blue fire
42:22
blue fire their hair is so can you
42:24
imagine this site and i know no one has
42:26
been there and has not seen it doesn't
42:28
understand i was taken back and i
42:30
actually saw that scene i saw what
42:32
happened because he was using the army
42:34
of heaven and i'm like no wonder no
42:37
wonder no for me because i see i'm a
42:39
seer i see the army of heaven around me
42:40
all the time i see their activities i
42:42
see them you know battling the army of
42:44
darkness and how badly they get beat
42:47
the army of darkness gets beat but so
42:50
i'm i was accustomed to seeing them but
42:51
seeing the sight
42:53
the shepherds were cowering behind rocks
42:56
or bushes their eyes were so wide you
42:58
know here's gabriel making this
43:00
beautiful announcement and then here
43:01
comes the army to sing in the heavens
43:04
and and it's the lights just like
43:05
blinding from there so you can imagine
43:08
they probably repeated that story over
43:10
and over again to everybody they knew
43:12
probably they probably didn't believe it
43:13
but it didn't matter to them when you
43:15
have an encounter you never forget it so
43:17
i'm quite sure because jesus did teach
43:20
over in that region he taught over there
43:22
there was jerusalem and other places
43:24
there
43:25
i'm sure some of the shepherds probably
43:27
eventually lived in um
43:29
in jerusalem i mean it wasn't that many
43:31
years now he was in there he was already
43:34
known as a great carpenter joseph taught
43:36
him as a master carpenter so jesus was
43:39
known as the carpenter the son of joseph
43:42
but we know he was the son of god
43:44
uh so he was known because of that
43:46
but but when jesus turned
43:49
30 he began his public ministry that
43:51
means he started demonstrating the
43:52
miracles the signs and wonders and i'm
43:55
quite sure it made it back to the ears
43:57
of those because this spread far and
43:59
wide that said i'm sure that some of
44:01
those who were in bethlehem or maybe
44:03
relooking in jerusalem they probably
44:05
knew exactly who that was when he
44:07
started talking about being the son of
44:08
god i i'm quite sure that there are some
44:11
of those shepherds are in heaven yes
44:15
wow that's awesome i i can imagine that
44:18
you went got actually got to go back and
44:20
see that whole entire scene
44:24
that's incredible oh my god i can so if
44:28
when i get to go to heaven can i go to a
44:30
place to watch that scene too
44:33
yes actually there is a place they have
44:35
um they actually have theaters in heaven
44:37
how about that now again i have to
44:39
always explain you don't have to have
44:42
ratings like r for rotten pg like partly
44:45
good g for good
44:47
uh you know i mean they actually they
44:49
they know what goes on here so any of
44:52
the theaters in heaven again there's no
44:54
darkness there's not going to be
44:55
profanity there's no no uh you know
44:58
killings none of that no violence
45:00
whatsoever so there's no dark witchcraft
45:02
none of that is in the theaters in
45:04
heaven but they have a place where you
45:05
can go
45:06
uh and you can actually watch when god
45:09
made when they made the earth you
45:11
actually get to see him creating earth
45:13
by watching it but it's not like a
45:15
screen it's like you're there
45:20
wow
45:21
oh my gosh i can't i cannot wait for
45:24
that um there's another question about
45:27
um renee asked this question and i've
45:29
heard a few people ask this question
45:31
before
45:32
um i'm seeing a lot of christians
45:34
fighting about celebrating or not
45:36
christmas is that a spirit of religion
45:39
trying to stop the celebration of
45:41
christ's birth
45:43
i think it's partly that i think it's
45:45
partly what we've been taught our whole
45:47
lives in church
45:50
you know depending on the church you go
45:51
to because you know there can be 50
45:53
churches to probably hundreds of
45:54
thousands of churches right now
45:56
and i tell you i tell people no matter
45:58
what church you go to make sure they're
46:00
teaching about the validity of jesus
46:02
christ who he is he's the only way to
46:04
heaven
46:04
i think it was that but i think totally
46:06
satan any chance satan god to draw
46:09
people away from the truth
46:12
that's the bottom line satan doesn't
46:14
want people to have fun
46:15
joy celebration but he does not want
46:18
them to have the truth because the truth
46:21
sets you free
46:23
so okay this place in heaven was created
46:26
before the earth was here
46:29
so you can't say
46:31
that christmas is some pagan holiday
46:33
sorry people
46:35
okay the pagans weren't here when god
46:38
made it in heaven however there is
46:40
someone who lived in heaven saw all the
46:42
beauty the wonder and the fun and when
46:44
he was thrown out of heaven he created
46:47
wicked evil things and said that was his
46:50
symbol that was his celebration their
46:52
lies i'm not saying there weren't these
46:55
wicked groups on the earth doing things
46:57
but satan stole different things in
46:59
heaven to make them look like they were
47:01
bad
47:02
so christmas town belongs to god
47:05
he decided to create it no human hands
47:08
made that place because it's a place of
47:10
fun of splendor a place to celebrate his
47:13
son it's in heaven he loves it when we
47:17
celebrate it on the earth and you know
47:20
what you all need to go get can you get
47:22
me the dvd real quick jen i'm going to
47:24
show you really quick a dvd i would
47:26
encourage everyone to get and watch with
47:28
your family it's called saving christmas
47:31
it's right there by kirk cameron
47:33
actually got really tired of listening
47:35
to the very thing you're talking about
47:37
he got tired of all the insults and and
47:40
and dragging you know christmas down
47:42
saying it's a pagan you shouldn't have
47:43
nothing to do with it so he went to the
47:46
word of god got all the scriptures and
47:49
wrote this script for this movie called
47:51
saving christmas it is hilarious but it
47:54
actually shows you nicholas back in the
47:56
time when he walked down the earth where
47:58
that came from and he actually explains
48:01
why christmas is so important on the
48:04
earth
48:04
like i said it's the only time some
48:06
people forgive each other it's the one
48:09
time they reach out and give to help
48:11
others even people they don't know
48:13
and we watch this many times and so i'm
48:15
just going to show you the cover i
48:17
already heard from kirk cameron's people
48:18
saying thank you for showing it
48:20
it explains everything and i think you
48:22
can get it on amazon is that where you
48:24
got it janet amazon so i'm going to
48:26
share with you right now here it is
48:28
it's called saving christmas
48:30
by kirk cameron and he explains why the
48:33
christmas tree is important are the all
48:36
the balls the lights on the tree what
48:38
they represent and you know representing
48:40
christ
48:41
even things like the nutcracker what
48:43
that represents for for heaven for
48:45
heaven on the earth and why do we eat
48:48
why do we celebrate what does all this
48:50
mean
48:51
and he shoots down
48:53
every myth
48:55
or reality of what evil has tried to
48:58
take over he explains it the best of
49:00
anyone i've ever heard so i will
49:02
encourage people get that dvd
49:05
let let yourself watch it with you and
49:07
your in your family it's the best
49:09
explanation i've heard i can just say
49:12
christmas even now people are having
49:14
more hope than they've had in like
49:16
almost two years uh hope is flooding
49:19
joyous flooding through celebration
49:22
i know most people pitch or sell heaven
49:24
is nothing but a place where you bow
49:26
down to god all the time part of the way
49:28
we worship in heaven is enjoying things
49:31
he put there that's our gratefulness for
49:33
what he gave us even in heaven so heaven
49:36
celebrates
49:38
it doesn't have funerals
49:40
there's no funerals there's no firing
49:42
squads there's no death certificates
49:44
being made out no one's crying no one's
49:47
grieving in heaven it is a celebration
49:50
of what christ did for us
49:53
by coming to this earth walking as a man
49:57
showing you the right way to live what
49:59
righteousness is what unrighteousness is
50:01
but i can tell you what there is a
50:03
copycat enemy our true enemy enemy is
50:06
satan i know he uses wicked people to do
50:09
things and then he makes up all these
50:12
occults and all these things i don't
50:14
even understand don't care about because
50:16
i'm not a part of that and i choose not
50:18
to participate or read it or watch it i
50:21
feel myself with the light of god with
50:23
his word what his plans are but i can
50:25
tell you christmas
50:27
has always had the presence of god on it
50:30
when you attend church celebrating the
50:32
birth of christ the choir singing
50:34
represents the angels that sang on the
50:37
day of his birth of some of the most
50:38
glorious songs ever made or created were
50:41
ones about christmas because in those
50:43
songs many of them talk about oh holy
50:45
night
50:46
hearts and heart the herald angels sing
50:49
and so all these beautiful things came
50:51
out of this one beautiful holiday
50:54
it's more than a holiday it's actually a
50:57
way of life that's what it is so yes i
51:00
celebrate it i will celebrate it now i
51:03
will celebrate in heaven one day it
51:05
brings families together but the gift
51:08
giving is one of the big things i know
51:10
man has commercialized it and i'm not
51:12
saying you know go go get a gift for
51:13
somebody it's a wonderful beautiful
51:14
thing to do maybe help the poor with
51:17
something
51:18
you know that's one of my favorite
51:19
things to do also but christmas is dear
51:22
to the father's heart
51:23
he made it
51:25
not a pagan
51:26
not some satanic group
51:28
even satan didn't make it he just tried
51:31
to steal it
51:32
and he lost
51:35
amen
51:36
and what this is a perfect this is a
51:38
perfect question to go along with what
51:40
you just said um there's the user it
51:43
says username because i'm happy they
51:46
asked a question um what can we give
51:48
jesus for his birthday to show him we
51:52
love and honor him i'm gonna move my
51:54
scarf over there yo
51:55
i would say
51:58
he loves cards
52:01
and uh what i do if i want to make a
52:03
card out for jesus i actually make one
52:05
out to him and i put it on my tree
52:07
i mean you don't need to put it even in
52:09
a card you can make him one
52:11
i would say he loves the kids to draw
52:13
pictures you know maybe christmas trees
52:15
or gifts or something like that
52:18
just telling him that you love him thank
52:21
him for coming to earth to be the way to
52:23
make a way back to the father
52:25
he loves it when we sing christmas
52:28
carols especially ones that talk about
52:30
the holy night and away in the manger
52:32
he loves and actually watches many of
52:36
the events put on by churches or groups
52:39
that show that scene back in the way
52:41
back in the day when christ was born and
52:43
they have someone be mary and joseph and
52:45
baby jesus and then they show you know
52:47
if they're really big ones they bring
52:49
live animals in
52:50
but he lost to see the celebration in
52:52
our heart so i would say the best gift
52:55
you could give him would be celebrate
52:57
the holiday
52:58
help people love them and remember why
53:02
we celebrate it
53:03
it is about funny gifts and you know the
53:06
joy but number one it's about a child
53:10
being born in the manger a king the king
53:12
of this world who created everything we
53:15
see and everything we touch and he's
53:17
very much a lie right now excited about
53:21
this time of the year
53:23
so i'd say make a little note telling
53:25
him that drawing a little picture
53:27
hang it on your tree
53:29
if i was a parent i would save those
53:30
somewhere in a special box one day and
53:32
say this is what you did
53:34
to celebrate our king jesus
53:37
oh that's beautiful
53:39
uh there brandon wants to know is there
53:42
spiritual significance when people here
53:45
on earth light up their homes with
53:47
christmas lights do people in heaven
53:49
light up their mansion in a similar
53:51
fashion for the sake of christmas
53:55
they have lights everywhere i can tell
53:57
you if you think that you've been driven
53:59
somewhere where they have a lot of
54:00
decorations and things
54:02
everywhere in christmas town even
54:04
outside of christmas town they all have
54:06
some kind of lights because it's
54:08
celebrating when the angels came and the
54:12
sky lit up with the glory of heaven
54:15
that's actually what those lights
54:16
represent that's what they like they
54:18
represent on your tree on your home
54:20
you're making a statement i celebrate
54:22
the birth of jesus christ i celebrate
54:25
with him in my life that i belong to him
54:29
and i'm recognizing that i'm standing
54:31
with the promises he gave me so i would
54:34
say definitely put lights up
54:36
we put lights everywhere we can
54:38
uh the other thing one more thing in the
54:40
and jesus just said to me now that
54:43
sounds wild he said don't forget the
54:46
cake
54:47
it is celebrating my birthday why not
54:50
make a cake and eat it so i can come and
54:53
see you eating the cake we actually make
54:56
a birthday cake for jesus on christmas
54:58
and at our christmas dinner we have a
55:00
birthday cake for jesus and we sing
55:02
happy birthday to him even though he
55:04
doesn't need to have that done he loves
55:06
it so don't forget to have cake or
55:09
cupcakes or something
55:10
that your children can be a part of and
55:13
celebrate with him
55:15
at a time when he had to change his
55:17
whole life
55:18
and even who he was just to come to this
55:21
earth for us
55:23
so we can sing happy birthday to jesus
55:27
on christmas and
55:28
make that part of our family tradition
55:30
with our kids so that they're always
55:33
raised knowing that it is that's why we
55:35
celebrate that's a great idea to do that
55:38
as a family for all you moms with young
55:40
kids that's a great idea we did that
55:43
growing up and now we still do it even
55:45
now we still do it so definitely you're
55:47
recognizing him you're you're honoring
55:49
him by recognizing him that he is so
55:52
special he's worth making a cake for
55:54
besides like i said he loves sweets i
55:57
didn't get to finish that when jesus was
55:59
growing up as a child he loved honeycomb
56:01
it was his favorite thing it talked
56:03
about it in the bible him and honey but
56:06
john the baptist his cousin also ate
56:08
honey and it was the sweet of that time
56:11
that would be like eating cake you know
56:13
in this day and he still loves sweets
56:16
and every time some new baker comes home
56:18
to heaven he's going to visit their shop
56:20
uh he loves his squeezing
56:23
he'll probably visit you if you make
56:24
sweet sweet
56:27
i was just making a half cake have cake
56:30
and celebrate the birth of christ
56:32
oh that's awesome well we have one i
56:35
think we can get through one more
56:36
question um christine asked my dad went
56:39
to be with god recently and he loved to
56:42
feed god's cardinals
56:45
my dad loved how the snow and the
56:47
cardinals looked would my dad be feeding
56:50
the birds in christmas town or are they
56:52
all over heaven
56:55
birds are all over heaven but i have
56:57
seen i don't know why they just look so
56:59
beautiful people make ornaments with the
57:01
red cardinals and i think i know they're
57:03
around normally other times of the year
57:05
but i just think they're represented if
57:07
you look at i got probably probably 20
57:10
christmas cards at least that had red
57:11
cardinals on them i'm not kidding
57:13
like with the tree with the snow and
57:15
everything in it i'm sure there are
57:18
birds there because the birds come to
57:19
sing happy birthday to jesus too
57:22
and so the birds will come in they'll go
57:24
out they'll come in but i have seen red
57:26
cardinals in heaven uh in christmas town
57:29
and other types of birds too but i'm
57:32
sure that they will be able to see birds
57:34
in that place singing
57:36
to jesus
57:37
oh that's beautiful well thank cat for
57:40
all the
57:41
questions today i mean they were they
57:43
were some awesome questions when i was
57:45
reading through them i was like oh my
57:46
gosh these are all you guys did an
57:48
awesome job sending in christmas time
57:50
questions i enjoyed each and every one
57:53
of them so will you just pray for us
57:56
real quick before we end uh this time
57:58
together and just bless everybody that's
58:00
listening
58:02
sure um i was gonna show one more
58:04
picture
58:05
and this represents sort of like the
58:07
army of heaven coming with gabriel
58:09
making the announcement um this is the
58:11
star right here if you can see if i can
58:14
hold it right i'll put the star you see
58:16
the star or not
58:17
yes
58:19
is it right side up
58:20
yeah there's the star of bethlehem
58:23
there's gabriel making the announcement
58:25
but the army that's with him is not
58:28
normal
58:29
and you can see some of them look like
58:31
creatures and they're singing so the
58:32
shepherds would be down on the ground
58:34
you know trying to go like oh my gosh
58:36
what is that and what is that up there
58:38
in the sky uh whenever it says host uh
58:41
in the bible they're talking about the
58:42
army of heaven
58:43
and so uh yes many of them came to sing
58:46
because you have to remember
58:48
jesus name was the lord of hosts so this
58:51
was his army coming to sing about his
58:54
birth on the earth along with gabriel
58:57
and so i had to show that real quick
58:58
picture but i will pray father i thank
59:01
you right now for blessing everybody in
59:03
this wonderful time this wonderful
59:05
season on the earth god don't let
59:08
legalism and religious mindsets set into
59:11
people that they don't think you should
59:12
celebrate it's not about fun
59:15
it totally has always been about fun the
59:18
sacrifice of your son
59:20
was one part of his life but his birth
59:23
was totally different
59:25
great celebrations were taking place in
59:27
heaven even mary and joseph and those
59:30
who were present with him they were
59:31
celebrating
59:32
and knowing he was the son of god coming
59:34
to this to this earth so father i thank
59:36
you that the reality and the presence of
59:38
jesus christ will flood everyone's home
59:41
everyone's person at this time of the
59:43
year god let love
59:45

59:49
cares you know jesus came to take them
59:52
away
59:53
i thank you for recognizing his birth
59:55
recognizing who he is but also remember
59:58
the celebration part
60:00
that they celebrate in heaven on earth
60:03

60:05

60:14
we're entering into a holy season of the
60:17
glory being released in the earth thank

01:49
in the rear view mirror you know not
01:51
that god was taken
01:52
by surprise by any of this he saw it all
01:55
ahead of time he knew what was going to
01:57
happen he wasn't shocked or starved in
01:59
fact i'm going to ask cat a question
02:00
about that when we bring her on in just
02:02
a minute but a couple of quick
02:04
announcements
02:05
for the next 90 days give or take uh
02:09
when we do johnny eno and he'll be on

04:26
in kat kerr
04:28
hi there
04:29
kat how are you doing
04:31
i'm doing great
04:32
good so you just said you're taking a
04:34
little bit of vacation so you're back
04:36
from your vacation started to do the
04:38
show and then back at it
04:40
well my vacation is i get a hotel in the
04:43
city because i have to come back and
04:45
forth here all the time so it's not like
04:47
i'm a way away that's but still you know
04:51
i'm away at the nighttime
04:53
wow nice nice family visiting and of
04:56
course right now we're not out of our
04:58
our offices yet so there's really no
05:01
place for anyone to visit me here so
05:03
just go get a really big nice hotel room
05:05
and get them some and we all can get
05:07
together and do things that's what we do
05:09
good good
05:10
i have a question that i will open with
05:12
when we go to questions
05:14
but before i do that um anything you
05:16
want to talk about current events or
05:18
anything going into next year anything
05:19
that either the lord's showing you or
05:21
what to expect i'm going to throw that
05:23
to you because we haven't pre-talked
05:24
about this i don't know if you have
05:25
anything so
05:26
oh i do absolutely the father's been
05:29
talking to me the last few days
05:31
now you have to understand when he talks
05:33
to me he talks to me like it's already
05:35
done when i say already done i mean his
05:37
plan
05:38
at the completion of his plan for
05:40
america his completion of his plan in
05:43
these days
05:44
for the world so he talks to me it's
05:46
always positive it's always powerful and
05:48
that's why i'm able to release that to
05:50
the people but i want you to know
05:53
even though it looks pretty bad in
05:54
certain places there are things still
05:56
happening i mean i i think probably the
05:59
number one thing i notice and hear about
06:01
a lot is how many people in the country
06:03
this country america are standing up
06:05
against the left i'm not going to say
06:07
much more than that
06:09
in unexpected ways and they they didn't
06:12
ever think this would all happen
06:14
i know you think it's all dragged up
06:16
they thought everything was going to be
06:17
over a couple months like they'd have us
06:19
and our whole lives would be over that's
06:21
what they had planned but the devil
06:24
always forgets
06:26
that we have god in us and this is god's
06:28
country and he doesn't know the mind of
06:31
god himself satan does not he doesn't
06:34
even know your mind unless you speak it
06:36
that's why you need to be careful what
06:37
you're saying with your mouth that's
06:39
good a lot in the atmosphere around you
06:41
you actually create an atmosphere around
06:43
you who's going to be in that atmosphere
06:45
and so make sure it's not all about doom
06:47
and gloom and fear and stuff like that
06:49
i'm not saying that kind of thing thing
06:51
isn't real but you do not have to choose
06:53
that so i can tell you god does not
06:55
choose it he's talking about the days of
06:58
glory more than he ever has before to me
07:01
because he said everything is beginning
07:03
to be like dust
07:05
and i know you probably don't understand
07:06
that as a spiritual a phrase that means
07:09
everything you're living in now or
07:11
having to be confronted with now will
07:13
become like
07:14
dust and in spiritual that means that
07:18
will be hard to see
07:19
hard to remember what that was like so
07:22
when things do happen on god's timeline
07:25
because everybody's talking about
07:27
different timelines or calendars or
07:29
whatever i go by god's timeline and if
07:32
you could be taken to heaven i'd
07:33
probably ask him to show you his own
07:35
timeline that wouldn't take you forever
07:38
because then you would know number one
07:40
you're not at certain times that people
07:42
are saying right this is not the
07:44
perilous times it is not the tribulation
07:47
and stop saying that the antichrist is
07:50
on the earth he's not on the earth
07:52
people the antichrist spirit is which is
07:55
a whole different thing but he's not
07:57
here yet okay he's not going to sit
07:59
around and wait for several hundred
08:00
years to do anything
08:02
satan however is trying to do a big
08:04
takeover right now which will fail
08:06
miserably
08:08
embarrassingly
08:10
i'm telling you what they won't want to
08:12
talk about hell and these times are
08:14
going through because of what is about
08:15
to happen they won't talk about that
08:17
part he probably won't allow them to
08:19
mention what a huge fail it was and
08:22
trying to take over this country and i
08:24
don't even have to mention names or
08:25
right or left or anything to tell you
08:27
that i'm telling you from god's plans
08:30
the days that are coming of greater
08:32
glory major changes will begin to happen
08:36
probably in the first quarter i can tell
08:38
you that much and the first quarter of
08:41
2022 uh which is some of god's great
08:44
plans to be revealed in that time and
08:46
things major things to begin to happen
08:49
and whether it's about certain
08:51
presidents or not certain presidents
08:52
fake or real or whatever god himself is
08:55
going to start doing things in the first
08:58
quarter of this 2022 i'm extremely
09:02
excited about it so i want to encourage
09:04
you you don't have to live in your soul
09:07
but every wicked terrible thing you're
09:09
hearing or watching hopefully you're not
09:11
i do want to add one thing or this is
09:13
glorious news
09:14
i happen to know actually literally
09:18
that these big networks are way down in
09:21
their viewing by 25 or 30 percent wow
09:26
yeah that is good
09:28
they're even this is on the secular
09:30
channel this was talking about this
09:32
which i i just heard about you know
09:34
literally heard about from another news
09:36
person
09:37
that they're down like i i can't mention
09:40
what networks but you know all those
09:41
who've been going along filling people
09:43
with lies
09:44
they're down by the viewing many of them
09:47
30 percent 25 which is unheard of for
09:51
major
09:52
networks
09:53
because they won't stop saying the same
09:56
thing
09:57
people are tired of hearing the same
09:58
news hey you network you're supposed to
10:00
be able to deliver the news
10:02
unbiased to give us great information
10:05
about many different things
10:07
get out of your box get out of your rut
10:09
you're stuck in a hole you may be
10:11
covered up with dirt one day
10:14
that's good this is the for real this is
10:16
a for real does not is some kind of a
10:18
spiritual kind of a thing out there
10:20
in the natural world this is really
10:22
happening for the first time on network
10:25
reviewing they they're so they're
10:27
they're filled with fear and they're
10:28
really very upset
10:30
that people aren't watching them anymore
10:32
but they're fed up with what they're
10:33
getting that should be a clue yeah for
10:36
sure for sure okay let me ask you this
10:38
because you said something and i want to
10:40
see if i heard you right you said when
10:42
things began to happen which i think you
10:43
were referring to when god starts doing
10:45
what he's about to do
10:47
you said it would be hard to remember
10:48
were you saying it's going to be hard to
10:50
remember these bad times is that what
10:52
you were saying yes that's a huge thing
10:54
that's a huge prophetic word right there
10:57
it is it will be very hard to remember
10:59
and even in the past when people went
11:01
through things and i've said this before
11:03
but i don't mind repeating myself
11:05
because god doesn't mind repeating
11:07
himself to me
11:08
he says things almost certain parts of
11:11
the day now he's continually saying
11:13
things to me
11:14
not just to keep me encouraged but every
11:16
time he speaks his frequency goes in me
11:20
and you want people want to know why are
11:21
you so fear sometimes why do you why do
11:23
you just get loud and yell because he's
11:26
yelling
11:28
because he is so he knows that he knows
11:31
that he knows if anyone else does he
11:32
does
11:33
this is what's going to happen not what
11:35
they're saying is going to happen the
11:38
new norm will be living in the glory
11:40
manifesting for god who he is in this
11:43
earth to the point where people want
11:45
believers to be their friends
11:47
wow
11:48
wow is that going to begin to go on
11:51
you will not even in your soul have room
11:54
for the past stuff that you went through
11:57
are these days which everyone's going to
11:59
realize at one point
12:01
it was all a fake
12:03
even some of those who were part of it
12:07
god removes things sometimes off the
12:10
earth in the atmosphere
12:12
even in the spirit realm some things are
12:14
just wiped out and i can prove it in the
12:16
word of god because at the very end of
12:17
the bible it says the former things will
12:20
be remembered no more there you
12:22
go well he's the only one who can do
12:24
that and i'm telling you what he's going
12:26
to do that somewhat as this whole thing
12:29
crumbles and falls
12:31
and you need to go back and look at the
12:33
november 4th report people of um was
12:36
that 20 20 20 21
12:39
no 2020 if it's november 4th it's 2020.
12:42
yeah yeah
12:43
yeah yeah go back and see that and you
12:45
hear exactly what's gonna happen guess
12:47
what he has not changed his plans
12:50
just like when he told noah build the
12:52
ark it was 120 years later people now
12:55
aren't you glad you're not noah we're
12:57
not waiting 120 years for things to not
12:59
just go back the way they were they
13:00
there's no way they can
13:02
and we don't want them to want to be
13:04
greater and more powerful
13:06
and more known in god's presence more on
13:09
the earth and creativity and inventions
13:12
and joy and celebration we've been more
13:14
on the earth than they ever before so
13:16
you can't even say i want to go back
13:19
we're going forward
13:21
we're going forward into the news that
13:23
he has for us uh new for america new for
13:26
places in this world but i can tell you
13:28
right now he's not concerned he's not
13:30
there you know
13:31
rubbing his hands or anything yeah
13:34
he knows what our beginning is he knows
13:37
what our end is and it's not the end of
13:40
ends okay
13:41
that's good that's good cat let me ask
13:44
this question you brought this up before
13:46
a couple times we've mentioned this on
13:47
the air but it's a long time in between
13:50
where someone was writing to me the
13:51
other day and she said it was so hard
13:54
because all of these things kept
13:55
happening bad and i can identify with
13:57
that because after a year and a half of
14:00
doing this give or take um a little more
14:03
than less give or take but
14:06
you see even when i try to never watch
14:08
the news some gets in it'll slip in or
14:10
i'll see something on that net while i'm
14:12
working or something like that but
14:15
the to the to the untrained eye it looks
14:18
like worse and worse and worse things
14:20
are happening
14:22
but you said once this wickedness has
14:25
been here all along god is just
14:27
uncovering that am i saying that right
14:30
you're absolutely right and almost any
14:34
time god's going to do something really
14:36
great on the earth
14:37
the first thing he does is expose what
14:39
evil is there
14:41
you can go back to the bible with the
14:43
old testament new testament that's
14:44
happened over and over again but people
14:46
who don't study the word like study i
14:49
know people read it but if you study the
14:51
word of god you would see and you look
14:54
for certain things
14:55
in the word then you would find out that
14:57
whenever something god is going to
15:00
happen the devil shows up to make people
15:03
believe it's a lie there's no way this
15:04
can happen i'm taking over you know you
15:07
won't have a chance you won't have a
15:08
life he's done that and not just in this
15:10
country the devil always does that and
15:12
that's what he's doing now only now you
15:14
know his little ploy was take the whole
15:16
world right now i'm going to push this
15:18
whole thing through i'm going to bring
15:20
the heat like satan could do it i'm
15:22
going to bring the perilous times and
15:23
the tribulation me and that's my big
15:25
time i have news for him the tribulation
15:27
won't be his big show it's going to be
15:29
the greatest downfall he'll ever have
15:31
ever for a thousand years after that
15:33
he'll be thrown in the bottomless pit i
15:35
would say that night would be a big show
15:36
for him
15:38
so even that's not if god's already got
15:40
that
15:41
and he knows what's going to happen at
15:43
the end of those few short years he does
15:45
have which is several hundred years away
15:47
i'm just going to keep saying it
15:49
um nobody knows the day but god god
15:51
hasn't told me today but he has told me
15:52
his generations and generations away
15:56
that's good you're sitting there in fear
15:58
that your children will have already
16:00
having a rough time but your
16:01
grandchildren your great grandchildren
16:03
what is it going to be about so bad then
16:04
they won't be able to live no this is
16:06
the opposite it'd be so great the
16:08
darkness won't be able to survive very
16:10
well or work very well because of the
16:12
power of god being operated in the earth
16:15
so yes um what was the question
16:18
well you did good on that uh let me ask
16:20
you this there was a time i don't
16:22
remember i have a suspicion that it
16:24
could be this time period but when god
16:27
first told you to declare let the show
16:29
begin
16:30
and then it's like the glacier on earth
16:32
i don't know if he used that term but
16:33
when did when did he declare that to you
16:35
and what was going on in the earth at
16:37
that time that was when
16:39
um the show began was right about the
16:42
time when well i'll have to say the t
16:44
word when those elections started the
16:47
first time okay
16:49
the first time it was probably when i
16:51
can go back and look because i actually
16:53
have someone that recorded
16:55
and it might be fun actually to release
16:57
those cds just so people can happen to
17:00
hear what god was saying because it
17:01
really didn't start stuff back then yeah
17:03
i didn't know
17:04
any of this was known god already knew
17:06
this stuff would happen but he knows how
17:09
it's going to end and what will happen
17:11
why is god allowing this so he can wipe
17:13
out the platform of evil that is right
17:16
now trying to control us
17:18
you can see people go well if this
17:20
wasn't here we'd all be doing fine oh no
17:23
don't use the word fine say powerful
17:26
because if evil wasn't present to
17:28
control your every word every movement
17:30
and dictate to you as a dictator what
17:32
you were going to do what you could have
17:33
what you couldn't have
17:35
you don't you you forgot sometimes i
17:37
think what freedom really is
17:39
but what's coming is the greatest
17:41
freedom we've ever had in this country
17:44
wow that's like everywhere and he did
17:47
say that i remember even the places i
17:49
was in uh if you go back and look at um
17:52
i think it's called
17:53
what's it called jen not activation
17:55
ministries anymore if you go back and
17:57
look at yourself
17:58
gateway i'm not zion and this was back
18:00
in 2014 i think probably 2014 2015
18:05
um was when he began to say let the show
18:08
begin
18:10
and also i was in uh also in missouri
18:12
saying that some people didn't want me
18:14
to say that they weren't sure you know
18:16
who would win in 2016.
18:18
and yet he did win in a landslide yeah
18:21
before that when god said let the show
18:23
begin
18:24
that show began actually in
18:28
2016 when those elections happened that
18:31
was the show beginning wow all that
18:34
you're in guess what
18:36
all of this going on right now i got to
18:38
just move the spirit
18:40
the holy spirit's going like this
18:43
drama king people yeah
18:45
drama he's ahead of this whole drama it
18:47
is a drama and you're all a part of it
18:50
so you know what you sit in the
18:51
sidelines and you cheer him on you cheer
18:54
on god the show has begun the show of
18:56
what it's like a big movie playing in
18:59
heaven because to them it's happened
19:02
of of god coming into this country
19:05
laying his hands on it turning it red
19:08
for righteousness and also for what is
19:10
right
19:11
yeah he's only touched it too late they
19:13
can't come in their little black evil
19:16
cells and and think i'm taking this and
19:18
here's the power of god in the life of
19:20
god laid in our country that's what
19:22
they're trying to walk on and run on and
19:24
let me tell you what there's going to be
19:25
some slipping and falling like you never
19:27
saw before because when it begins to
19:29
rise up out of the ground this is how
19:31
the spirit realm works when that begins
19:33
to rise up it got laid on our country
19:37
and he laid it down and like the
19:40
beginning of 2016
19:42
and he was telling me to say even louder
19:44
let the show begin that was his show
19:46
this is not satan's show wicked man show
19:49
this is god's show wow it's got comedy
19:53
it's got excitement it's got drama you
19:55
see all the drama it's got exposure in
19:58
it for the evil uh it is a big show and
20:01
it's not like it's a joke it's really
20:03
real i know that but if you saw god's
20:05
viewpoint
20:06
the show has begun and it isn't over and
20:10
guess what at the end is victory and
20:12
celebration so god talks a lot about
20:15
that's why i talk about victory and
20:16
celebration you know celebrate and eat
20:18
kate eat little pieces and i already
20:20
tell people we're gonna have a glory
20:21
diet when this is all over that's good
20:24
so when you've been to heaven multiple
20:26
times hundreds and hundreds of times
20:28
have you ever seen the lord rubbing his
20:30
hand saying man i don't know if this is
20:31
gonna work out
20:35
never once never
20:38
and i have i mean i have seen when i say
20:41
them that's the trinity okay
20:43
when i've seen them
20:45
they laugh a lot yeah i'm not laughing
20:49
at the devil good laughing at the devil
20:51
who thinks i have everything he's always
20:53
saying i got it now that's what the
20:55
devil says i got it now i got it i sort
20:57
of like i don't know whatever
20:59
but he hadn't got nothing but fair
21:01
because he is the biggest loser that
21:03
ever existed
21:04
i think he must have been branded with a
21:06
big l on his forehead that'd be
21:07
interesting to see that
21:09
because he thought listen if this person
21:11
is dumb i mean i don't use a word
21:13
lightly if he's stupid enough
21:16
no intelligence almost left in his
21:18
entire head who lives in heaven with the
21:22
trinity and thinks he's taking over
21:27
do you think he's numb enough and stupid
21:28
enough try to take over the earth i
21:30
would say yes he probably is he has not
21:32
any marbles left in his head whatsoever
21:34
um i think the demons play marbles with
21:36
him or something i'm not being funny i'm
21:38
being serious wow
21:40
because something happened when he was
21:42
kicked out of heaven part of his brain
21:44
did get seared by the lightning bolt you
21:46
can't be hit by a lightning bolt from
21:48
god lightning in heaven is blessings and
21:50
love he was kicked out of heaven with a
21:54
million megawatts of love on that
21:56
lightning bolt
21:57
and ever since then was planning and
21:59
planning to take this earth and now this
22:01
is what robin and i heard robin say a
22:03
little bit the other day that that satan
22:05
was making his move to try to push it
22:07
when he said push it push it ahead of
22:09
time right like perhaps time people it
22:12
lives in god it comes from god here's
22:14
the one you thought he was going to take
22:15
over kicked him out right he has no seat
22:17
there no power there whatsoever and the
22:19
only power he really has over us is what
22:21
we give him or allow him to take or we
22:24
participate with him those are our
22:26
family members let's go this is still
22:28
the show this is still the show's going
22:30
on
22:30
and now i'm telling you what the angels
22:32
are sitting watching except not the army
22:34
the army is extremely busy yeah to our
22:37
fam our family members who have gone
22:38
before uh we
22:40
you said many times about they they are
22:42
allowed to look down to portals to see
22:44
special events weddings and births and
22:47
parties and things like that whatever
22:49
god allows them to see
22:51
do they know about this stuff that's
22:53
going on on the earth at all or are they
22:55
kept from knowing this what what i'll
22:57
tell you what they've seen they've
22:58
already seen the show steve oh really
23:01
how so we've already seen the show many
23:03
times he will actually show them if
23:06
there's a movement going on in the earth
23:07
there's a time that's his time on there
23:09
she shows them the end already in heaven
23:12
so they're not up there going oh no
23:13
what's going to happen to them they're
23:15
up there celebrating and saying
23:18
you know like go holy spirit go god go
23:21
jesus
23:22
they've already seen the end of that
23:24
show that we're in right now
23:25
okay that's really good all right here's
23:28
a question i'm going to skip forward to
23:30
number five so if you're watching this
23:31
illumination she and i share the same
23:33
list
23:34
this kind of taps into what we're
23:36
talking about and then a woman named
23:38
debbie asked what's the difference
23:39
between the kingdom age which i think
23:41
the lord announced to you on uh 2012
23:45
and what's the difference between that
23:47
and the millennial age do you
23:49
can you describe it because they sound
23:52
similar like the kingdom age
23:54
and the millennial age people would
23:56
think those were the same things so
23:57
what's the difference no they're not the
23:59
kingdom age is where we actually we
24:03
as the body of christ operate in that
24:05
kingdom that christ always talked about
24:08
it is a spiritual kingdom you operate in
24:10
spiritual power and authority it's all
24:13
connected to heaven but it's our
24:15
operations on the earth so when jesus
24:18
takes over the millennial age it's a
24:20
whole new age and actually the kingdom
24:23
age goes all the way up
24:25
into the into the millennial age where
24:27
some people say are not it's not going
24:28
to happen well you need to go to heaven
24:30
and see god's timeline all right because
24:32
i do know what will happen
24:34
no this is us walking in power and
24:36
authority on the earth because of christ
24:38
with him uh changing and shifting all
24:41
kinds of things because he wants it done
24:44
and needs it done until the day when of
24:46
course that that battle happens at the
24:49
end of the kingdom age at the end of the
24:52
kingdom age which includes the perilous
24:55
times the tribulation at the end of that
24:57
time
24:58
when satan is bound and thrown in the
25:00
bottomless pit for a thousand years
25:01
christ takes the throne
25:03
in the city of jerusalem
25:06
in this natural world and rules
25:09
as king of this world
25:12
that's the millennial age so this is uh
25:14
walking power and authority the kingdom
25:16
age is a whole new time on the earth
25:18
because of the revelation we have an
25:20
understanding of who we are we will
25:22
begin to shift things for god and i'm
25:25
saying i'm not going to give the
25:26
fullness of that yet but we were walking
25:28
upon authority not having any fear of
25:30
the enemy crushing darkness pushing it
25:33
back operating with the army of heaven
25:35
it's our time to shine
25:37
it's hard time to do that for him at the
25:40
end of those days
25:42
will be the millennial age where christ
25:44
himself will be sitting on the throne he
25:47
won't need us to do that people
25:49
yeah and the 2012
25:51
am i right was that when god announced
25:53
the kingdom age 2012 yes yes we stepped
25:56
off a threshold of time and we stepped
25:58
into the kingdom age in 2012.
26:01
okay and i i told people on this show
26:03
before
26:04
my uh
26:05
spiritual father way taylor who's gone
26:07
home to me with the lord was telling me
26:09
that in 2012 that we had entered the
26:11
kingdom age and i thought where is he
26:13
getting that you know well he obviously
26:15
received it from the lord he's been
26:16
caught up in heaven himself
26:19
so he said that and there was a uh older
26:21
man who's now gone to be with the lord
26:23
arthur burt
26:25
there's a arthur burke with the k arthur
26:27
who's the older one he began to prophesy
26:30
this in 2012 that the he talked about
26:32
the
26:34
the flaw of the spirit that would not
26:35
even ab again or something and he
26:37
probably was 2012. so there are multiple
26:40
people you're not the only one in other
26:41
words that got that this is when we
26:43
entered the because i have you you're
26:45
wrong
26:45
people in africa someone in africa wrote
26:48
a book
26:49
saying it's the kingdom age and they
26:51
didn't fully understand what that meant
26:53
they weren't shown into the future the
26:55
kingdom age they knew god was saying
26:57
that and that was also in 2012 i didn't
27:00
even know about them so i had gone to
27:02
the middle of america and declared this
27:04
for god that we have stepped because he
27:06
was telling me to do that so i did that
27:09
we're in the kingdom age right now
27:10
people which means we will understand
27:13
fully what christ meant when he talked
27:14
about the kingdom the gospel of the
27:16
kingdom
27:17
he was talking about the gospel but
27:19
there's a whole kingdom that comes with
27:20
that that's your power that's your
27:22
authority that's your dominion because
27:24
of belonging to him you have you operate
27:27
in that kingdom and you're over the
27:29
darkness
27:31
so all this exposure of darkness has
27:33
everything to do with that there's
27:35
different things he will have god will
27:36
have happened in the kingdom age first
27:39
one understanding you're in a new time
27:41
and then he sets a new person in place
27:43
who will begin to bring the greatness
27:45
here and then even though there's a
27:47
disruption god knows all this and then
27:49
he he had you know
27:52
that people were understanding there is
27:53
great darkness in the earth because
27:55
before most people were ignoring it
27:58
we were sound asleep we thought
28:01
you were sounded asleep let me tell you
28:03
yeah we were sound asleep we didn't know
28:06
that the child trafficking was actually
28:08
going on that the human trafficking was
28:10
going we didn't we we literally because
28:13
and whenever we brought up people would
28:15
say that sounds like a big conspiracy
28:17
theory there's no such thing
28:19
no it was not a conspiracy theory yeah
28:22
wow i mean that's huge in this year that
28:25
we're in 2021
28:27
i think more people in the body of
28:29
christ have awakened than have ever
28:31
awakened i don't know if they're fully
28:32
awake i don't know if we're we're fully
28:34
awake yet in fact i want to segue into
28:37
this question regarding cocaine we're in
28:39
the kingdom it's getting intense now the
28:41
lord already knows what's going to
28:43
happen it's already done in his
28:45
so are there things i'm not asking you
28:47
to tell me what you shouldn't tell me
28:49
but are there things that the lord has
28:51
told you about the kingdom age that
28:53
you're not supposed to release yet and
28:56
maybe what are those type of they're not
28:58
saying tell me if you're not supposed to
29:00
but what are the why would you why would
29:01
he give you stuff to say no don't
29:03
release this yet
29:05
oh i do know this that the revelation
29:07
that he has given that we will operate
29:10
in will totally change everyone's life
29:12
yet he said it will change the way the
29:14
body of christ operates
29:16
so it's much more major than just an
29:18
individual life being changed during
29:20
these days uh it's not just waking you
29:23
up this is what he said you need to wake
29:25
up stand up and stand out so that's
29:28
what's coming
29:29
that's what he wants they need to wake
29:31
up but they need to stand up that means
29:33
stand up and say stuff and then when you
29:35
stand out that's you operating in the
29:38
power of god so he's letting me tell you
29:40
that much he always has like a process
29:42
or a wave a protocol that he does things
29:45
god is not without protocol and planning
29:48
okay he does do that probably more than
29:50
anyone so the whole
29:52
plan for this is happening now
29:54
is for people to wake up and go wow
29:56
there really is evil there's wickedness
29:58
and it does want to take over and and
30:01
he's showing people this is what people
30:03
would live like in some foreign
30:05
countries they do live like this they
30:07
have nothing it's often taken away
30:09
they're controlled
30:10
they own nothing that is the plot of
30:13
satan being worked out by man by wicked
30:16
man
30:17
satan can't take a throne right now
30:19
himself and do what he'd like to do he
30:22
can't do that so he's still using humans
30:24
to do his dirty work that's all i can
30:27
call it he's using humans who
30:29
participate
30:30
and say oh yes i want this i'll make
30:32
money i'll be hell have power and he'll
30:35
make them even feel powerful i'm talking
30:36
about satan but he has no real power as
30:40
far as god is concerned and he shouldn't
30:42
have any power over us at all so what's
30:46
going to happen is when god begins to do
30:49
certain things
30:50
you begin to not just wake up you're
30:52
going to stand up and start saying stuff
30:54
like i'm talking about taking authority
30:56
declaring things to happen in the
30:58
atmosphere and places in the earth
31:00
that's what you should be doing it's
31:02
wonderful to know god is here and yes he
31:04
is he he is in control he owns all of
31:07
this but he wants you as his
31:09
representative as his son or his
31:11
daughter not something else in between
31:14
uh taking authority that you have a
31:16
right to take because of christ
31:18
and so what's coming next is the
31:20
stand-up thing many people are waking up
31:23
they don't know what to do i'm talking
31:24
about believers right now right right
31:27
dude they don't know what to say you
31:28
know should i say be quiet or say
31:30
nothing your voice power in it you have
31:33
such power in the spirit realm because
31:35
you have to remember you see with your
31:37
human eyes right the physical realm you
31:40
don't see unless you're a seer the
31:42
spiritual realm when you say something
31:44
what happens in the spiritual realm is
31:47
satan's plans begin to get crushed
31:50
from the spiritual side
31:52
when they begin to get crushed by things
31:55
you're declaring and taking authority
31:56
over that power is taken away from the
31:59
humans who are operating in wickedness
32:01
this is why it's so important to
32:02
understand who you are that's what
32:04
spirit forces which is why i'm not gonna
32:07
say everything yet but i'm telling you
32:09
you will fully understand
32:11
that's the stand up part but the
32:13
standout part is really those words so
32:16
stay wake up stand up and stand out
32:19
that's god's plan for us in this time
32:23
wake up realize this stuff has really
32:24
happened it's really going on but you
32:26
shouldn't have fear if you're a believer
32:28
you have authority over it where in the
32:31
kingdom
32:32
in the kingdom of age
32:34
so this all going to flow together and
32:36
you know what it'll be almost like
32:37
breathing one day steve when they wake
32:39
up they're already declaring and saying
32:41
things they're stopping things in the
32:43
natural because of what they're saying
32:44
in the spirit realm that's good that's
32:46
how it's going to happen
32:48
so wake up stand up many are starting to
32:51
stand up they're actually saying things
32:52
against what's going on and i'm not just
32:55
talking about taking things to court
32:56
going to the media who will listen but
32:59
i'm saying they really begin to stand up
33:00
and where they live and say things that
33:02
they're not agreeing with it that this
33:04
is not god god's got great plans it's
33:06
important to say god's plans so
33:08
important if you hear a bad report
33:10
always give a good report
33:12
you have to give a good report from god
33:14
god has us under control we're working
33:16
with him we're going to see his hand
33:18
move for us but we have to stand up and
33:20
be on his side and we have to say we're
33:22
on his side okay it makes the difference
33:25
in the spirit realm around you
33:27
and what's in your own soul is very
33:29
important so the stand up part
33:32
is recognizing in your own soul man this
33:34
just been flooding in i'm getting all
33:35
this negative stuff out and ask god to
33:38
put stuff in you can say god i i choose
33:40
my will to bind to my soul your love
33:43
your authority the dominion
33:46
your will your way
33:48
what i have in christ when you say those
33:50
things he'll flood your soul with that
33:52
which will kind of wipe out which is
33:54
part of the dust thing if you come like
33:55
that
33:56
it begins to minimize the impact in your
33:59
soul and the way you think of what you
34:01
choose because to minimize that when you
34:03
ask and bind the things of god to your
34:05
soul yeah let me ask this about you
34:08
until this whole wake up season in these
34:11
last few years
34:12
i've always been taught that when things
34:14
are wrapping up it'll get worse and
34:16
worse one world government
34:18
elites globalists will appear and they
34:21
will begin to try and take control and
34:23
now we're in the midst of the kingdom
34:25
age and you're saying it's not
34:27
that time yet
34:29
so but we know right now cat that
34:31
there's elites out there i'll just use
34:32
the word elites or globalists they would
34:35
rather just control everything and make
34:37
the rest of us you know serfs and slaves
34:40
and whatever
34:41
so is god telling you during this
34:43
kingdom age that whole
34:46
elite thing is going to get
34:48
tamped down destroyed wiped out or just
34:51
less influential what what are we
34:53
expecting god to do with these globalist
34:56
elites who are trying to control us
34:59
i know that some of them well this is
35:01
what he said lose their power
35:03
lose their money and lose their voice
35:07
okay
35:08
and you know
35:10
and and you don't know if it's you're
35:12
not saying if it's
35:14
because here's what i'm one of the
35:15
reasons it's in my mind is when i've
35:17
when i'm asking this question you said
35:19
before there's going to come a time when
35:21
if you want to sin you're going to have
35:22
to go to a city where that's
35:25
uh probably because
35:26
there'll be righteous cities where
35:28
there's just almost no sin if i am i
35:30
saying that about right
35:32
there's yes there will be glories of uh
35:35
realms of glory
35:37
cities of glory regions of light it's
35:39
called regions of light steve and
35:41
regions of darkness that's what god
35:42
called okay regions of light will
35:44
overwhelm the regions of darkness in
35:47
other words there'll be more regions of
35:48
light
35:50
where people will go to live in because
35:51
of the presence of god
35:53
sickness this is god there'll be no
35:55
sickness in those cities
35:57
wow wow that's so this is why this is
36:00
why this all has to happen
36:04
it has to happen so we understand you
36:06
have to see the division there's so much
36:08
gray and god says gray is where people
36:10
don't know or don't care
36:12
there is an area even in the spirit
36:14
realm there's those who are in the
36:16
darkness those who are in the light
36:18
and then in the middle is a gray area
36:20
where people can't make the decision or
36:21
their play back and forth in the camp
36:23
because the camp of darkness came from
36:25
the enemy or his camp the camp of
36:27
righteousness is the camp of light so
36:29
there's regions of light
36:31
okay and regions of darkness you'll have
36:34
to live in the regions of darkness
36:37
do evil i mean the crime will be
36:39
outrageous but there will be almost no
36:41
nothing that is counted as illegal in
36:43
the regions of darkness wow they can do
36:45
any kind of perverted awful horrible
36:47
thing
36:48
because it'll be pushed back
36:51
when i said god said crush it and push
36:53
it back
36:54
that's what will be happening in the
36:56
spirit realm
36:57
crush uh the enemy out of whole regions
37:00
and push them back until they won't be
37:03
able to just go into some they won't
37:04
want to go i say better i'll say it
37:06
better holy spirit yeah they don't want
37:08
to go into the regions of light it'll be
37:11
so painful for the demons to go into a
37:13
region of light they won't be able to
37:15
function yeah and what you're describing
37:18
huh well what you're describing yeah i'm
37:21
really focusing on these regions of
37:22
light because i'm saying gee is is the
37:24
lord saying to his believers his kids of
37:28
you know children of god is he saying
37:30
look
37:31
i'm giving you all of these righteous
37:33
cities throughout the earth or
37:34
throughout the united states live in any
37:36
one of them that you want and you will
37:37
prosper and you'll you will be no
37:39
sickness is that what
37:41
or will some people some people it
37:43
doesn't sound like your people are being
37:45
called into regions of darkness to
37:47
evangelize them but maybe that's maybe
37:49
that's just my
37:50
i think that would have to be a very
37:52
special people
37:54
that have very special people
37:56
um the why for the reasons of life is to
37:59
magnify god's power and glory
38:02
and i can tell you when it spreads it
38:04
says it will be known around the world
38:07
if there's only one way that happens
38:09
it's not going to necessarily just but
38:10
by spoken word it's going to be by the
38:12
activities
38:13
of the saints of god and i love to say
38:15
the saints of god because people are
38:16
already bashing you know
38:18
nicholas and saint whoever don't you
38:21
know in the bible we're called saints
38:22
that's right is that true stephen that
38:24
is true that's right to the same welcome
38:27
person
38:28
if you belong to jesus christ you are
38:30
the saints of god this is not what this
38:32
whole thing is about but i just couldn't
38:33
help but put that little
38:35
thing out there well you know it's just
38:37
so well so you're saying that it would
38:40
be the right thing for christians to
38:42
find
38:43
regions of light and just move there
38:45
well i think it's going to be created by
38:47
the saints
38:49
okay okay the glory when these these
38:51
waves of glory will come
38:54
to consume us you have to understand i
38:56
don't we don't have time even in this
38:58
short segment to explain it all i mean i
39:00
know robin knows so much he tries to but
39:03
he can do one after the other you know
39:04
we do it once a week and that's great
39:07
because god wants people to be focused
39:09
on that and again i have to thank you
39:11
and i'm still going to say people you
39:13
need to give to elijah a list of
39:15
elijah's streams because you would not
39:18
be getting this broadcast you would not
39:20
be getting powerful revelation and it's
39:22
nice to have head knowledge about the
39:24
word and head knowledge what people
39:26
researched and looked up and seen but
39:28
revelation comes from the heart of god
39:30
it doesn't come from me at all okay the
39:33
12th grade education
39:35
that doesn't come from me i can't make
39:36
it up i can't even think it up the
39:38
things that god says revelation is one
39:40
of the most important things you will
39:41
get that's when it says man does not
39:44
live by bread alone but by every word
39:47
spoken by the mouth of god that's
39:49
revelation he speaks and his prophets
39:52
speak it but sometimes other people in
39:54
the five full ministry sometimes
39:55
everyday people will get revelation
39:57
but the regions of light and darkness
39:59
they won't happen overnight just so you
40:01
know that
40:03
there are some things that actually will
40:04
be a suddenly and begin to change right
40:07
away
40:08
in this next year it's going to start to
40:09
change right away but what will build
40:11
he's building on
40:13
is he will have regions of light and i
40:16
was shown those regions of light that's
40:18
why i can talk about it i saw this whole
40:20
city the light coming from it was
40:22
amazing and thinking god you're really
40:24
in that city this was in the future he
40:26
was taking me he took me there
40:28
and i and he said those that's coming
40:30
from the saints of god who live there
40:33
that's my light in them
40:35
operating and living there permeating
40:38
every structure the ground the
40:40
atmosphere
40:41
and he showed me a line of cars coming
40:44
down 95 who had they had sick people in
40:47
their cars or even dead people in their
40:49
cars and i don't do this right now
40:51
and they were coming to a region of
40:52
light when they pulled over the line
40:55
that was the boundaries of that city the
40:57
people came to life i'm not making it up
41:00
they were healed instantly or they came
41:02
to life
41:03
where's 95 by where is this that you're
41:05
describing is that
41:06
95 runs up the entire east coast all the
41:09
way from the furthest north all the way
41:11
down to miami the i-95 interstate 95 wow
41:15
wow and i saw cars backed up so far and
41:18
they were bringing people to a region of
41:21
light that's incredible where god was
41:24
because they gave themselves to god they
41:27
had no sin in their life and so stop
41:29
telling me you can't sin
41:31
and stop making excuses by saying we've
41:33
all sinned and come short of the glory
41:35
might as well keep sinning well you know
41:37
what you know what you forgot the last
41:38
part of that sentence what is the sin
41:40
he's talking about
41:42
all have sinned
41:44
and come short of the glory of god
41:47
that's what he's talking about you're
41:48
talking about being an old sinner and
41:50
just sinning all day long he's not
41:51
talking about that right he's talking
41:53
about the glory have you made any
41:55
creativity for him have you used your
41:57
life to bring glory to of god in this
42:00
earth
42:01
that's going to change
42:04
because we'll know him so well and be in
42:06
his presence so much
42:08
and be used by him because we said yes
42:11
to use us you can say yes i want to be a
42:13
believer and repent to jesus and get
42:15
saved but if you want more you go after
42:17
that more
42:18
you go after the more but what is coming
42:21
in this country i know i saw it there
42:23
will be one day regions of light where
42:26
people will go to be in that presence of
42:28
god they'll be consumed by the presence
42:30
of god
42:31
if they want to sin they'll have to
42:33
leave
42:34
yeah so when you think there's not going
42:35
to be a change we are not going further
42:37
into darkness right now it's being
42:39
exposed god said what is exposed can be
42:42
taken
42:42
down yeah
42:46
so he's so you're so all of these wicked
42:48
things that we're having is not people's
42:51
eyes being open so they can see how far
42:53
we are now going downhill it's not that
42:56
he's exposing this so people can stop
43:00
the evil cooperate with god is that what
43:02
you're saying yes you need to choose
43:04
what god if you're a believer i'm
43:06
talking to believe okay the world the
43:08
secular world
43:09
is going to be influenced by whoever you
43:11
know i'm sure they're there's some let
43:13
me tell you this i have to say this
43:15
there's more
43:16
right now living in this country against
43:19
the darkness
43:20
whether the believers or a secular world
43:23
are good moral people they're not
43:25
necessary believers they need to become
43:27
believers but they don't want what's
43:29
being dished out to us that's good
43:32
probably close to 80 million are against
43:35
all of it which is the majority of this
43:37
country but the other side it can't sink
43:40
in their own minds are seared
43:43
it talks about your mind being seared
43:44
you can't think normal so those who have
43:46
said yes to the wickedness and evil they
43:48
can only think that they can't even
43:51
think what is good that's why they can't
43:52
plan anything good why can't they play
43:54
any good there's only darkness in them
43:57
so god is exposing to you all of you it
44:00
is present this is how satan operates he
44:03
comes in in certain ways to try to take
44:04
what he wants he'll always find people
44:07
somewhere he did way back in the days of
44:08
noah and ever since then he can always
44:10
talk people into doing wicked things if
44:12
they if they have greed in them and have
44:15
anger or hate or whatever he will go
44:18
after those people to use them to be
44:20
leaders but we who are already in the
44:23
light who are filled with christ can
44:24
speak against those things i'm not
44:26
saying you have to go to the doorstep
44:28
and do it either but you shouldn't just
44:29
be repeating the horrible things as
44:32
being said by those people you should be
44:34
saying what god says he's exposing the
44:37
darkness it will be taken down he will
44:40
clean a platform so that we can operate
44:42
freely in these days of glory coming on
44:46
the earth he already put part of the
44:48
glory in the foundation in the very
44:50
ground you put his hand on it and put it
44:52
in there so when it comes from above and
44:54
beneath guest is going to get caught in
44:55
that smack i can tell you he's got
44:58
powerful plans he's not ignoring us he
45:01
is working out his plan and there will
45:03
be nobody escape
45:06
there's been a part of all that kind of
45:07
controlling they won't escape
45:10
and he assures me of that all the time
45:13
justice has actually already been sent
45:15
he's just waiting to release it and
45:18
that's interesting can you elaborate
45:19
that a little bit more you said it's
45:21
been sent
45:22
so it's here
45:24
but he's not
45:26
um initiating it somehow he's not
45:28
anytime
45:30
god will send things many times ahead of
45:32
the time it's activated
45:35
and it's waiting
45:37
so you can't see
45:39
those who are waiting to do something
45:41
because these are spiritual things
45:44
okay but i can tell you the spiritual
45:46
realm is the main realm it's the primary
45:49
realm not the physical realm
45:51
yeah the super the spirit realm
45:52
supersedes it was here before it'll be
45:56
here after this physical realm so in
45:58
that spirit realm with how god operates
46:00
but he uses physical
46:02
being here just a minute yeah go ahead
46:04
and get it while you're taking that and
46:06
um well i don't want to interrupt that
46:08
thought so go ahead
46:10
he uses us to carry out things he wants
46:13
done on the earth
46:15
so if everybody starts citing oh listen
46:17
all i can listen to stop listening to
46:19
the bad stuff people
46:21
i'm not saying ignore it i'm saying say
46:23
something against it yeah i get up in
46:26
the morning i begin to declare the day i
46:28
declare the day i take authority every
46:30
day
46:31
over anything trying to interfere in my
46:33
life to kill steal or destroy to attack
46:36
me in any way to take things from me
46:38
that are mine i command the host to pull
46:40
down strongholds that's what strongholds
46:42
do they build their self around you to
46:44
do something against you
46:46
but he's given that the army of having
46:48
to pull them down you can't see him you
46:50
can't walk up and take something in your
46:52
hand so some people think it's not real
46:54
it's more real than you are it was here
46:56
before you were
46:59
wow wow
47:02
go ahead go ahead and finish that well
47:04
he really is right now waking up
47:07
not just so you'll be awake and be aware
47:10
it's so you then stand up
47:12
and start speaking against it
47:15
in your own life if every believer just
47:17
started speaking in their own
47:18
neighborhood i'm not the darkness in the
47:20
evil flooding my neighborhood i'm not
47:22
agreeing with any evil takeover i'm not
47:24
gonna i'm not tolerating it in any way
47:26
in jesus name you have left you have
47:29
like loosed bombs in the spirit realm
47:31
against the darkness
47:33
yeah
47:34
and every evil person on the earth no
47:36
matter who they are i mean there's a
47:37
list of names i can't give you but if
47:40
you if you spoke against the evil
47:42
controlling them
47:44
their power they've been operating and
47:46
will be stripped away
47:48
man left on their own has fear that's
47:51
what they live in if they're in darkness
47:53
and the power that's been given to them
47:55
through satan or to operate in or demons
47:58
around them to do that is stripped away
48:00
this is what comes fear and confusion
48:03
that's why you're going to see more and
48:05
more of those people fall upon each
48:07
other tell on each other that's a good
48:10
sign that that foundation that god
48:12
talked about is crumbling you cannot
48:13
have a foundation of evil it never
48:16
stands it won't even stand in the day of
48:19
tribulation because no matter how bad
48:20
satan wants everybody he's never going
48:23
to get them and he isn't going to win
48:25
now that's the main thing you have to
48:26
remember god is not there just twiddling
48:29
his thumbs he already had plans for all
48:32
of this
48:33
i'm not tolerating evil around me i'm
48:36
not participating with it in any way
48:38
whatsoever by gossiping about the bad
48:40
things going on i
48:43
i shoot darts into the heart of the
48:45
enemy that would be satan and all his
48:47
demons when i say i'm not tolerating the
48:49
darkness i have power over i'm speaking
48:52
against all these things have been said
48:54
that we have to do in the spirit realm i
48:56
want them to become like dust
48:58
now can there's people
49:00
something
49:01
there's people we know who are evil you
49:03
said you talked about there's a list and
49:04
most of us could name nine or ten off
49:06
the top of our head who we know they're
49:07
doing evil they're everybody knows it
49:10
they know their name they know what
49:11
they're they've been up they know how
49:12
famous they are for their evil now
49:14
so if i know let's just say i take five
49:17
or six of those who i know who i believe
49:19
are the most evil
49:21
tell me how i should decree
49:24
without getting in trouble with god
49:26
because we're not supposed to
49:28
wish anyone to go to hell because god
49:30
doesn't wish anyone to hell so how would
49:33
we fight against what those specific
49:35
people are doing without praying a miss
49:38
or without decreeing wrongly
49:40
it's what is what they're operating in
49:42
my scarf's
49:44
it's
49:45
they operate because they have given
49:47
themselves to the evil okay and a lot of
49:50
them know they've done that and don't
49:51
care they're benefiting from it some
49:54
actually have had promises from evil
49:56
beings that they will be promoted in
49:58
satan's kingdom which is a joke they'll
50:01
be promoted they'll be honored they'll
50:02
have more than anyone else this is what
50:04
they get they get tormented more than
50:06
anyone else in hell and satan laughs at
50:08
them i'm talking about the highest
50:10
people involved in all this he will
50:12
laugh at them and he will have them and
50:14
he will take them to hell when they die
50:15
that's what will happen to them that is
50:17
their end and they can't change that end
50:20
only by confessing to jesus christ and
50:23
asking him to forgive will they not go
50:26
there because you cannot commit that
50:27
much evil against human flesh against
50:30
babies against god's own against god's
50:33
own
50:34
and not think you're going to pay a
50:35
profit so how do i
50:36

52:59
it through you or i heard it from some
53:01
other prophetic person who said that
53:03
they saw a couple regions that they even
53:05
named that had god had one day turned
53:08
them into like a region of light one of
53:10
those that i heard mentioned again i
53:11
don't remember who it was said that they
53:13
saw las vegas as dedicated to the lord
53:16
is that you that was yes it was
53:19
wow
53:22
i was actually in las vegas i've been
53:24
there like what three or four times
53:27
uh i was invited to speak in las vegas i
53:29
was speaking in reno on a yearly basis
53:32
and first of january i was invited to
53:34
speak out all the time and i would see a
53:36
lot of of course when in las vegas so
53:38
let's talk about las vegas when i was in
53:40
las vegas the first time i went i saw
53:42
uh demon serpents wrapped around some of
53:45
these great big old hotels that had
53:48
gambling and let me tell you the thing
53:50
why another thing that man is
53:51
pornography and prostitution is legal
53:55
yeah it's legal and they follow you
53:57
around and give you up these packets
53:59
these groups that's what they do for a
54:01
living they go around to give it to
54:02
different people and it tells you how to
54:04
connect with
54:06
very defiled defiled places that are
54:08
already there so i saw unclean spirits i
54:11
saw spirits of witchcraft i just tell
54:13
you witchcraft i saw a wickedness in
54:16
high places and these platforms you hear
54:18
me talk about it's what it is it's a
54:20
platform in the spirit realm and these
54:22
demons sit on them and give orders to
54:24
the other demons
54:26
who to mark who to go after because of
54:28
things that they're doing in that you
54:30
know they call that the city of sin
54:31
right
54:32
[Music]
54:33
in the midst of walking down the
54:35
sidewalks and i would every now and then
54:37
say something against something i saw
54:39
the holy spirit would say something
54:40
against us so i'd take authority over it
54:42
and cast it out of that and it would it
54:44
would have to leave it would scream and
54:45
leave it would scream like it was on
54:47
fire or i would just say fire fire of
54:50
god and they would all run and scatter
54:52
they were with these groups of people
54:53
walking around so these are people had
54:55
demons with them that were were working
54:57
in defilement to defile people
55:00
uh and they paid for the department
55:03
but these other big buildings i saw some
55:05
weren't hotels some are places that
55:08
wicked people go to operate from they
55:10
have operations there that are secret
55:12
operations that are wicked and evil and
55:14
i saw them and these like snakes were
55:16
coming in and out of these buildings
55:18
like poking his stuff in there and
55:20
delivering stuff and coming back
55:22
and he said
55:23
those buildings that you're going right
55:25
now i will take my hand one day and i'll
55:27
go shh when he did that every one of
55:30
them were gone every man on every
55:32
building gone wow
55:35
he said and i will put my mark on those
55:37
buildings i would begin to see the mark
55:39
of god either his own personal star
55:41
which we call the star of david was
55:43
actually put on these buildings there
55:46
there was a cross on some of these
55:47
buildings stopped saying the cross is
55:49
irrelevant
55:50
you're throwing away your whole
55:51
salvation you need to know that they
55:53
have crosses in heaven number one jesus
55:54
christ is a carpenter that's his mark
55:57
i bet it's important to him he died on
55:59
one okay anyway i began to see the light
56:02
of god
56:03
come first
56:05
because i talked about it from the
56:06
ground up and began to consume these
56:10
buildings and then all the lower level
56:12
demons who'd been on assignment were
56:15
running screaming like dust out of this
56:18
city
56:19
and god said one day this will be called
56:21
the city of his son
56:24
it will no longer be the city of sin i
56:27
have a market for myself so las vegas
56:30
is gonna be god
56:33
if you think you can't affect your city
56:35
i don't think they're as bad as that
56:36
place okay the stuff that goes on that's
56:39
actually been legalized by people who
56:42
allow it to be legalized when when
56:44
humans give permission
56:46
that's why some areas are darker than
56:48
others they're there in authority giving
56:50
permission for that to happen
56:52
and i don't need to say anything about
56:54
what's going on in other places right
56:55
now they're giving permission but you
56:58
have a voice yourself as a believer you
57:01
have more power in one little finger
57:03
than all these wicked people do because
57:04
you believe in the one who owns it all
57:07
who made it all okay you need to find
57:09
out from jesus christ what he wants for
57:12
you what is your point where's your
57:14
partner
57:15
and all this i know this is to always
57:17
speak life and light to people of course
57:19
you always declare that people will not
57:22
leave this earth until they've known
57:24
jesus christ as their savior you allowed
57:26
you're allowed to offer that
57:29
but there are some
57:30
there are some right now that will not
57:32
have mercy and god has told me i will
57:34
not give them mercy they've gone beyond
57:36
what they know that is so defiled and so
57:40
filled with the darkness and the evil if
57:42
i don't wipe it out it will continue
57:44
okay wow
57:45
yeah
57:46
yeah and you know i've asked you that
57:48
question too about that mercy part and i
57:50
if i believe that you
57:52
that i'm being correct when i say
57:55
usually the lord has shown him when
57:57
someone has become that well known for
57:59
their iniquitous ways they're
58:02
by and large gone they've by and large
58:05
given themselves over is that kind of
58:07
what you're saying
58:09
some of them have some of them don't
58:11
care when they begin to not care about
58:13
life itself yeah not any form of life
58:16
they don't care what they do that is so
58:17
wicked and evil they don't care who dies
58:20
they don't care if they kill everybody
58:21
and because if you give yourself to
58:23
satan satan wants everyone to die i mean
58:25
he wants everybody off this earth he
58:26
wants to take over with his own regions
58:28
of demons that's what he wants but he
58:31
can't do that he doesn't have the
58:33
authority or the power to do it he has
58:35
to use mankind well apparently there's
58:38
enough wicked people now who've been
58:40
placed in different places that that can
58:43
say things to make things happen for the
58:45
devil but you know what
58:47
there he's not god
58:49
he is not god
58:51
okay satan is not god people he was
58:54
created
58:55
as lucifer by god sin and evil was found
58:59
in him by the way god did not create sin
59:01
i need to clear that up he one of his
59:03
accusations bought against him by god
59:06
was uh iniquity was found in him that
59:09
sin wicked evil sin it was found in he
59:13
himself desired and that's why that's
59:16
the only thing he can say is his nothing
59:18
else that was made was made by him god
59:21
made everything in this earth how we use
59:23
it or what we do with it that's our
59:25
decision it's our decision
59:27
but there would be a day when evil that
59:30
person called evil satan will not be on
59:33
the earth they'll still be angry people
59:36
angry leaders in countries who haven't
59:38
received god when that tribulation does
59:40
end there's going to be people on the
59:42
earth that haven't accepted christ
59:44
they're just going to be the people who
59:46
will survive it although people always
59:47
show in movies they've nobody survived
59:49
well who is christ going to rule over on
59:51
his throne yeah and it does talk about
59:54
those people and some of them will be
59:55
kings and he said they won't want to
59:57
bring what they have before him he'll
59:58
say i won't send rain on your land
60:00
because they'll be wicked evil people
60:02
so yes he jesus christ is still going to
60:05
have a say in this earth especially
60:07
sitting on the throne in the millennial
60:08
reign it will happen it's after the
60:10
kingdom age comes that millennial age
60:13
but right now it is a decision ground
60:15
and i hear more people who don't know
60:16
what time it is they say you have to
60:18
make a decision now for christ well
60:20
everybody should every day is a good day
60:22
to receive christ and start operating
60:24
with him instead of giving yourself to
60:26
the other side which is you're never
60:28
going to win on that side but there will
60:30
be regions of light where people will
60:32
sickness will not be able to abide not
60:34
even crime can take place in those
60:36
regions
60:37
wow wouldn't that be no crime no
60:39
sickness uh it's gonna be a little bit
60:42
like heaven on earth i was gonna say
60:43
that it sounds a little bit like heaven
60:45
it's like a pre it's like one of the
60:48
the single most beautiful place and
60:51
situation you would have ever have lived
60:53
in up to that point any human being
60:55
right this side of heaven
60:57
yes that is absolutely true and the
60:59
miraculous will be happening everywhere
61:02
i i like to say this about the
61:03
miraculous it will you'll never become
61:05
familiar
61:06
every time you see a miracle of god a
61:08
suddenly of god
61:10
god given you you know his goodness or
61:12
moving his hand on your behalf you never
61:16
become familiar you're overwhelmed every
61:18
time by his love by his patience with us
61:22
he is long-suffering and i think i
61:24
mentioned this the last time the reason
61:26
why noah had to take 120 years to build
61:28
the ark wasn't because god was trying to
61:29
make noah work
61:31
he offered out of the long suffering of
61:34
god's own lobby allah 120 years for
61:36
anyone to repent that was there
61:38
they would have been on the ark
61:41
so all those wicked people had 120 years
61:43
to tell god
61:45
they were repent for their evil ways
61:47
they wanted to know him they could have
61:49
been on that ark so it was their own
61:52
fault their own a hardheartedness that
61:55
they didn't god didn't need 120 years
61:57
from noah to build the ark he wanted to
61:59
give 120 years for all the evil wicked
62:00
so yes he is long suffering he does want
62:02
to extend his mercy but we
62:05
we have a choice to make with our own
62:07
will
62:08
and right now god wants you to stand up
62:10
with your own and start declaring
62:12
against any evil present that you're not
62:14
tolerating it i serve only the most high
62:17
god i don't serve the darkness i will
62:19
not tolerate the darkness you just say
62:21
that in your own home you're releasing
62:23
stuff in the atmosphere that god can
62:24
actually use against that physical
62:26
darkness that's trying to take over this
62:28
world so i'm not ignoring anything and i
62:31
am not ignorant and very well informed
62:34
by the god who made this world but i
62:37
also know he has a timeline and this is
62:39
not the end it may be the end of many
62:42
wicked people
62:44
but i do ask for mercy you have to add
62:46
that mercy for those who were sucked
62:48
into it forced into it threatened into
62:51
it and they don't want it god make a way
62:53
for them to get out of that in jesus
62:55
name yeah for those i suppose that god
62:58
would seem to have even more mercy if
63:00
they were literally from birth
63:01
victimized sacrificed over and all that
63:04
they didn't even have a choice
63:07
i can imagine the lord giving them extra
63:09
you know attention to make sure they had
63:11
the choice that was never given to them
63:13
so wow wow
63:15
well cat you know i think you know we
63:16
could go on and on i have a list of
63:18
questions but i don't want to tamp down
63:20
anything you've already said i don't i
63:22
feel glad to just ask you if you would
63:24
just pray for the people who are just
63:26
what i'm hearing is a lot of people
63:27
saying this is so
63:29
encouraging why doesn't anybody speak or
63:32
why don't more people speak about the
63:34
encouragement that's ahead of us so
63:35
maybe just pray for those people and
63:38
whatever god fills
63:39
your heart with
63:41
yeah father i thank you for this
63:42
beautiful day that you have made no man
63:45
has made this day no man holds the air
63:48
we breathe no man really says what can
63:51
happen what cannot happen only you alone
63:54
sitting on your throne you have the
63:55
right to say that you in the word made
63:58
this world you made everything ever
63:59
existed your son came and died because
64:02
you asked him to if you think people
64:04
that there is not mercy why did he come
64:06
to die he didn't have to he he agreed to
64:09
do that but he wasted hell on the third
64:12
day he took authority walking as a
64:15
righteous man he was the son of god he's
64:17
also called the son of man he walked
64:19
righteously on the earth hell could not
64:23
hold him
64:24
so it should not be able to hold you
64:27
force you put fear in you you need to
64:31
stand up and start saying i'm not
64:33
tolerating the darkness i'm not
64:34
tolerating the evil around me anymore
64:36
open your front door and kick it out and
64:39
then you say i invite god the god that
64:41
created all things his son jesus christ
64:43
i invite holy spirit to consume this
64:45
property consume our home and then you
64:48
begin to build a habitation for heaven
64:50
which is what we all need around us god
64:53
i speak against anyone trying to control
64:55
hurt a maim or steal people's identities
64:59

67:01
him more things to declare and decree
67:04

think there's testimonies on there and
67:08
it's the one place on planet earth that
67:10
you can give to me online if anybody
67:13
else if you see me on other places
67:15
there's a lot of fake facebooks and
67:16
youtubes out there but i will not ever
67:19
stand here or sit here and say i'm
67:20
asking you for money i won't do that i
67:23
won't say there's some group over here
67:24
you need to give to those are just plots
67:26
to get your money but you can go to
67:28
catcure.com and click on the treasury
67:30
and that is how you can give online if
67:32
you want to and while you're given to me
67:35
please remember
67:36
to give to elijah streams because if it
67:39
wasn't for them
67:40
you would not have these weekly shows
67:43
that have been happening actually since
67:45
october of uh is that 2008 2020 i think
67:50
yeah yeah 2020 all the way from october
67:53
up to election day and then we were
67:55
going to stop on november the 3rd and
67:57
god said tell steve i want one more day
67:59
you know he said that
68:00
one more day i have something to say he
68:02
didn't even tell me on november the 3rd
68:03
it was on november the 4th he began to
68:05
say what had happened what was going to
68:07
happen what people would be thinking
68:09
about it and then he would say what he
68:11
was going to have happen and ever since
68:14
that day we decided to not stop these
68:17
broadcasts that's right you have got a
68:20
lot of gratitude and things to steve uh
68:23
i'm a very um
68:25
i i'm moving the spirit a lot and i'm
68:27
very super busy but this has been an
68:29
anchor that i have no question there's
68:32
no no choice in my life that i do this
68:35
every week because god said you're going
68:36
to do it so because of him because if
68:39
steve has opened the door you've never
68:41
had before i'm not saying they are not
68:43
the prophets but the ones god is
68:45
speaking through and steve knows are
68:47
true and let me tell you if he finds out
68:49
they're not he's going to let you know
68:51
but this is his call on his life and
68:53
he's gone through a lot to sit where he
68:55
is right now
68:57
it hasn't been easy it never is you pay
68:59
a price so i hope you will open up your
69:01
pocketbooks and your wallets and you get
69:04
money and you send that to steve schultz
69:06

14:10
hey cat hi
14:11
yeah that was all for free you got to
14:13
watch all that for free
14:14
yes it was nice getting to see your
14:16
staff though people think you know
14:19
they see you and they think that's it
14:21
and it's not true really you've got to
14:23
have a lot of other people to do things
14:25
that's why it costs money and even
14:28
people say well why do you have to sell
14:30
products why do you have to do that and
14:31
i said well
14:32
because we put money out we have to pay
14:35
money out for all kinds of things where
14:36
you know the building the electricity
14:38
whatever just in normal things but then
14:40
when you have staff involved or if you
14:42
order a lot of equipment and supplies
14:44
and stuff to produce things you're
14:46
putting out
14:47
it does cost a lot of money and god is
14:49
faithful though but the staff is so
14:52
important it really is next to your own
14:54
family i have to say the staff that work
14:57
with you day to day is so important now
14:59
i'm going to be in agreement with what
15:01
you're doing or you're going to have
15:03
issues to believe in that god has called
15:06
you and placed you or he has
15:08
and to show honor and everybody needs to
15:10
show honor to one another
15:12
that's something in this new year that
15:14
we're doing we're going to make some
15:15
changes that's going to really help
15:17
everybody have more fun do things
15:18
together as our staff and we'll be some
15:22
at some point moving into a building
15:24
itself this year which will make
15:26
everything much easier for all of us
15:28
awesome awesome well kat we talked a
15:30
little bit off the air we're going to
15:32
take a twist not a bad twist a good
15:34
twist but
15:35
talk about
15:37
some things i'm trying to decide do i
15:38
just throw it open for anything first or
15:40
should i get to my questions that we
15:41
were talking about off the air what
15:43
would you like to do
15:44
um
15:46
go ahead with the things that are off
15:47
the air okay let's do that
15:50
let's talk about that first okay so
15:52
here's what's here's what the let me
15:54
just introduce it like this uh we get
15:56
lots and lots of emails and we can't
15:58
answer every single one but the probably
16:00
one of the most common
16:02
questions that comes out
16:04
just in general not just with cats show
16:06
but all the shows is they'll say steve
16:08
kat said
16:09
and robin said da da da da da
16:12
and they and they and they'll list what
16:14
it is they said and they'll say who's
16:15
right and basically who's wrong
16:18
and so i was talking to you about the
16:20
and i i it's very important for me to
16:23
tell the people
16:24
you and your husband are good friends
16:26
with robin and his wife robin and rob
16:28
yes we are so we are when you see things
16:32
really really differently at times
16:34
uh this is not a friendship breaker this
16:37
is not a deal break in your relationship
16:39
isn't it
16:40
no it's not okay so
16:43
so what happens i'll just continue with
16:44
the question then so robin had a very
16:46
intense word about the president's life
16:49
and praying for this his safety and all
16:51
that and i brought that up to you you
16:52
don't watch because you keep your
16:55
prophetic uh disconnected so that you
16:58
get your right from god if i'm saying
17:00
that right right
17:01
and i said that to you today about the
17:04
president's safety and what what was
17:05
your initial response about that
17:08
well i had of course um the father will
17:11
talk to me anything that has to now we
17:12
know who president we're talking about
17:15
um
17:16
yeah
17:17
anything comes up about him the father
17:19
will immediately tell me and then i will
17:21
do what is what i normally would do uh
17:24
there is a million hosts with him right
17:26
now in florida let's just say in florida
17:29
in florida right now a strategic
17:31
positions strategic places
17:34
um and their assignment is to be with
17:36
him as long as god is using him for
17:38
specific things they will remain
17:41
so i had done that that was it that was
17:43
the limit that's all he told me to do he
17:45
didn't tell me to um and let me say this
17:48
first i have to say this verse
17:50
when god chooses people to be a prophet
17:53
there that's the office of a prophet
17:55
that's not somebody who's real prophetic
17:58
or they see prophetic things or hear
18:00
them sometimes that is their office that
18:02
is a position
18:03
that gives them a lot of authority with
18:05
god he's going to clearly speak to them
18:07
but he does not tell every prophet the
18:09
same thing and you should never expect
18:11
for those who are new to it you can't
18:14
expect every prophet to say the same
18:16
exact words about the same exact thing
18:17
because we're not going to do that i
18:20
have my whole call in my life as a
18:21
prophet to train the body of christ to
18:23
be powerful
18:25
to know their spiritual weapons and do
18:27
that type of thing but also to know
18:28
about heaven my number one call is to
18:31
reveal heaven to earth i've been there
18:33
thousands of times so i'm going to speak
18:35
mainly about that if god has something
18:37
to say about things going on in the
18:38
earth he'll tell me i will certainly
18:40
tell people and right now we have a lot
18:42
going on in the earth and he shows me
18:44
different parts of that and what to do
18:46
about the different things he's going to
18:47
show robin something different that
18:49
doesn't make either one of us wrong it
18:51
doesn't it's just that he's handling
18:53
that for god and dealing with that i'm
18:55
dealing with the another part of it
18:57
hank's dealing with another part of that
18:58
daniel i mean we all have our part with
19:01
god but one thing we do do is we know we
19:03
each hear god and we'll honor them as
19:07
the office of a prophet and so i would
19:09
encourage people what you're being told
19:11
in the moment um you should participate
19:14
in that like praying for the president
19:16
of course is always going to be
19:17
important and i would just say this
19:19
they've always been trying to take him
19:20
out people
19:22
yeah they could get rid of anyone on the
19:25
earth it would be him
19:27
because he is a big threat but god's got
19:28
him in his hand but robin because it was
19:32
revealed that's what he shares what is
19:34
revealed to me i will share and you're
19:37
never going to be disappointed in
19:39
hearing the voice of god and making sure
19:42
that it is all covered but by different
19:44
ones of us so don't expect us all to say
19:47
exactly the word and i can't validate
19:49
robin i didn't hear that from god i
19:52
can't validate hank he can't validate me
19:55
or johnny in law or any of the other
19:56
prophets we have we're accountable for
19:59
what he shows us and tells us to say and
20:02
to and to share and so that's what we're
20:05
doing yeah
20:07
he wouldn't have us here yeah and i'll
20:10
say this let me add this because there's
20:11
there's that one that just came up and
20:14
the one that we get even more than that
20:15
and you know i i am a perfect piece i'll
20:18
just tell you i didn't used to be this
20:20
way but i
20:21
after knowing cat and knowing robin i'm
20:24
at perfect peace that robin
20:26
holds a position that at any moment of
20:28
the day
20:29
the rapture could happen i think he but
20:32
he also holds
20:33
he also holds and he said on the air
20:35
that what cat's position in his position
20:37
could all be true at the same time i
20:39
don't quite get what he means but i get
20:41
robin
20:43
robin knows what he means and i get cat
20:45
i tend to be like for everything i see
20:48
you know this says this gospel of the
20:50
kingdom will be preached to all the
20:51
world and then the end will come where
20:53
there's about five billion of the seven
20:54
who have not yet had the gospel preached
20:56
them so it's easy it's easy for me to
20:59
say we got some time we got some work to
21:01
do but there's an imminent
21:03
uh in the heart and understanding of
21:06
robin and so and how about how do you
21:08
what else would you like to say about
21:09
that cat
21:10
i would say that um
21:13
it depends on the way god uses a prophet
21:15
also i have to say that
21:17
um some prophets are more stubborn not
21:20
saying robin is stubborn in any way
21:23
but even in the old testament
21:25
and in the new testament there were
21:26
prophets that weren't very happy about
21:28
what god gave them to say but they said
21:30
it anyway
21:31
and uh i can just say that
21:34
you know we we all know that um
21:37
jonah didn't want to say some things
21:39
right and uh but god had him in the end
21:42
say what he needed him to say and i
21:44
think obedience is very key
21:46
uh for the prophet to realize uh
21:48
whatever he is saying i will say it they
21:51
all also they are still individuals we
21:54
are individuals like i i'm just going to
21:56
say this i like different colors i like
21:58
different food i like different things i
22:00
i'm not in a box in that in that that we
22:03
all have to eat the same thing or like
22:05
the same thing so inside our heart what
22:07
we've been raised in what we understand
22:10
and and as pointed out in the word is
22:13
what we will follow but i
22:16
was taken on purpose and shown before
22:19
earth began
22:20
after
22:21
even after the new earth is here god has
22:23
on purpose taking me down his own
22:26
timeline
22:27
and so for me
22:29
i will focus and say what god has shown
22:31
me on his timeline
22:33
not any calendar not anybody's calendar
22:35
anybody else's timeline no matter how
22:37
many are out there i have to say what
22:39
god has shown me on his own and on his
22:41
own we are not anywhere near
22:44
i know sometimes people are impacted by
22:46
the things are going on right now he's
22:48
actually setting up for what's about to
22:50
happen
22:51
the next 100 years would be so key to
22:53
seeing the power and the glory in this
22:55
earth and god is not willing to give
22:57
that up he's going to make sure it
22:59
happens he's going to love all those who
23:01
stand and speak for him he'll honor them
23:03
he'll reward them and so you you trust
23:06
that god knows what he's doing and this
23:09
only thing that will happen
23:11
uh uh you know in the end is what god
23:14
wants to happen his timeline will happen
23:17
his way and on his day and it says no
23:20
man knows the day that the lord will
23:24
return and even that's not the end
23:25
people
23:26
please you need to really understand
23:28
when christ returns is not the end okay
23:31
that's the beginning of another whole
23:33
age you know the millennial age will
23:35
happen that's christ himself sitting on
23:37
the throne in jerusalem it's going to
23:39
happen that's a thousand more years so
23:41
you can't really talk about the earth
23:42
being destroyed and disappearing and
23:44
dissipating and i'm not saying robin's
23:46
saying that or hank or anyone else i'm
23:48
just saying
23:49
it can't happen because things have not
23:51
happened that god in his own words said
23:53
would happen yet rest assured you're in
23:55
the sum of the greatest times that are
23:57
about to happen not the opposite and all
24:00
those who were were pure to their word
24:03
and their understanding
24:04
when they get to heaven they'll still be
24:05
happy anyway
24:08
it's not over until the father says it's
24:12
over
24:13
and we're in the great days that seem
24:15
impossible to you
24:17
but not with god we had some guests that
24:20
have come to us and especially when we
24:22
were in the studio not so much now but
24:24
we had some guests and they would
24:25
describe several different programs that
24:27
they were on one of them they had to
24:29
spell out pages and pages and pages of
24:32
their theology
24:34
to tell the this tv station so they
24:36
would now if they would be allowed you
24:37
know when is the rapture
24:40
you know and i don't i've never seen the
24:42
form but i understand it's very
24:43
voluminous
24:45
um and and i think let me just tell you
24:47
folks that's not us we want to know that
24:50
a prophet is is prophesying they're a
24:52
person of good character they have the
24:54
office of a prophet uh or close to it
24:57
and maybe i'll put it that way their
24:59
character is good their reputation's
25:00
good we're not gonna ask them
25:03
what's their va what's their uh
25:05
position on when the rapture is we're
25:07
not gonna ask him those kind of
25:08
questions it's one of the main reasons
25:11
is
25:11
that particular issue has just split the
25:14
body of christ we don't want to do that
25:15
so whatever your position is say it with
25:18
firm but we won't we will not tend to
25:20
even major on that issue
25:24
and i'm talking kind of out of both
25:25
sides of my mouth because it is true and
25:28
count you've seen this it is true
25:30
that i and we do tend to
25:33
gravitate towards this position which is
25:36
we're going to be here for a while we've
25:37
got work to do it is true
25:39
but
25:40
we are
25:43
the last thing last scripture in the
25:46
adjustment occupy until i come he never
25:50
said sit there and try to figure out
25:52
every day and everything and every month
25:54
so everything lines up with what you you
25:56
assume will happen
25:58
you know it says to occupy that means
26:00
take authority that doesn't mean sit
26:02
around and wait doesn't mean sit on the
26:04
sofa it means you take authority you
26:06
will be active in the kingdom and preach
26:08
the gospel the king be active and
26:10
demonstrating and manifesting who god is
26:13
that's what we're all supposed to be
26:14
doing right now not trying to figure out
26:16
if we have to drag our rapture rug out
26:18
or escape to the mountains he didn't say
26:20
to do any of that
26:22
you're supposed to be busy doing things
26:24
for him until the father says to his son
26:28
going down you know i think of that
26:30
scripture where jesus tells the story
26:32
about there was a master and he went to
26:34
a far away place where he's talking
26:35
about
26:37
the son going to be back with his father
26:40
and and though the servants you know
26:42
were given a task to do
26:44
and then after a while they kept not
26:46
coming back kept not coming back and
26:47
they said he's not coming back so they
26:49
began to beat their fellow servants and
26:51
put them in bondage and and then then
26:54
basically when the master did
26:56
come there was there was trouble to pay
26:59
you know a lot of trouble you know and
27:02
and the bottom line was if the masters
27:04
delay they're supposed to be doing he
27:06
gave them a job to do they were just
27:08
supposed to be doing it you know that
27:09
was what that whole parable is and and
27:11
what was important was how they treated
27:13
their fellow servants a long way that
27:15
was what what he was looking at and and
27:18
so anyway well we could talk about that
27:20
for a lot but that's the fascinating
27:21
thing but just remember folks
27:23
the guests we have on we don't
27:25
pre-screen them that they have to agree
27:27
with everything theologically especially
27:29
as it relates to that now i'm going to
27:31
say one other thing and i'm going to
27:32
admit this is a personal bias we knew
27:35
and felt absolutely convicted through
27:38
our prophets there are
27:40
earlier ones that god was saying he who
27:43
he had picked the man in florida who
27:45
starts with the t that was the man and
27:47
god had not changed his mind so yes in
27:50
that vein that wasn't a theological
27:52
position that was like what
27:54
if you're hearing what we're hearing
27:56
those are the prophets that we brought
27:58
on i will say that so you know we're not
28:00
going to bring someone on
28:02
um there was someone that used to write
28:04
for us and he took a position
28:07
and his position was and this is what he
28:10
said
28:11
he said god said
28:15
deal with it
28:16
biden's president now it doesn't matter
28:18
if he stole he's president now pray for
28:20
him well now he's not riding for us i'm
28:23
not mad at him
28:24
i'm not he's not an enemy but he's not
28:27
riding force he's not a guest
28:29
so that kind of position we'll take but
28:32
we don't we won't ruin a friendship over
28:34
it
28:35
it wasn't a punishment we just didn't
28:37
schedule them for the show or we don't
28:38
schedule his work so i think that makes
28:40
sense so well kat anything else you want
28:42
to share before we get into questions
28:44
the thing i just want to um
28:47
i have to say what god has said to me
28:48
almost every single day
28:50
to keep a heart of celebration
28:53
because that is his plan
28:55
and no matter what you see going on i'm
28:57
not saying it isn't happening i'm well
28:59
aware that's why i take authority over
29:00
it all the time uh make sure you're not
29:03
participating
29:04
when you participate with what the
29:06
darkness is or what the plans of the
29:07
enemy is you're highlighting that
29:10
you're supposed to talk more about the
29:12
power and the love of god and god's
29:15
plans in this time that inspires
29:17
encourages and it just it just dissolves
29:21
fear because you know yourself god's
29:23
never given us a spirit of fear but a
29:25
power love and a sound mind so what you
29:29
should be doing right now in this moment
29:30
no matter what's going on you should be
29:32
walking in the power of god having a
29:35
sound mind and no fear whatsoever that's
29:37
what you should be doing
29:39
good good good cat well i've got
29:42
eight-year-old lana if i'm saying her
29:44
name right with the first question she
29:46
says did jesus always look young
29:49
even as an adult so that's her question
29:52
well i'm quite certain
29:55
that he could not have been young and
29:57
gone to the cross
30:00
he couldn't have been young in the fact
30:02
that um
30:03
you know maybe he didn't look totally
30:05
mature or at his age he was 33
30:08
and we all know that that doesn't mean
30:10
you look sorry sweet and heaven please i
30:12
probably hear that more than anything
30:13
else
30:14
jesus had a light that was in him all
30:17
the time
30:18
and and he was a real character he was
30:22
he knew who he was at that point in his
30:24
life he knew he was the son of god he
30:26
knew that all of creation was made by
30:28
him he walked with such uh confidence in
30:31
this earth
30:32
knowing he made this and he came to die
30:35
for those who were on the earth that was
30:37
his goal but i can tell you he laughed a
30:40
lot and a lot of people don't see him
30:41
that way they seem only serious or
30:43
fierce you know when he up up ended the
30:46
whole temple courtyard and everything
30:48
because they were doing things wrong
30:49
there that's why he did it but he was
30:51
focused on what god sent him for what
30:52
his father sent him for to let people
30:54
know the truth to let them know that
30:56
you're not supposed to be afraid even he
30:57
taught about not being afraid of the
30:59
darkness so he walked in confidence but
31:02
it made him a little bit bold he was
31:04
bold but he was liked very much even the
31:07
sinners liked him because guess what he
31:09
didn't speak doom and gloom to people
31:11
even back then he took about the power
31:13
of god the life of god the light in us
31:15
you know why he came and and i think
31:18
that that probably would set him apart
31:20
he probably seemed maybe had that spirit
31:22
of youth in him since he was actually
31:24
eternal right and i think that's more
31:27
than what she she's talking about he
31:29
always had so much life in him there was
31:32
nothing that even probably was even
31:34
close to even aging but he did reach the
31:36
physical age of 33 he was strong even in
31:40
the natural he was strong he lifted
31:42
trees he built he was a carpenter he
31:45
used timbers he moved those himself so
31:47
he was strong he was in great shape he
31:49
was happy at the light of god in him uh
31:52
people wanted to be with him all the
31:53
time so i can see that he had that
31:56
spirit of use or life in him so as far
31:59
as that goes yes
32:01
he always acted like he was he was never
32:04
would probably act that he was an old
32:06
person at all nor did he even think that
32:08
way he loved to be with children also
32:10
all the time which to many people back
32:13
then probably would have been more of a
32:14
a chore or something like that he never
32:17
felt that way he liked the life the
32:19
imagination uh the belief that they had
32:22
and so in that spirit of youth i think
32:25
that's probably always going to be in
32:26
him good good all right now i've got um
32:30
this is it says i i
32:32
imc ega so i don't know if that's a name
32:34
or a username it says username here
32:37
and the question is is god's hair like
32:38
pure wool as described in daniel
32:41
7 9 says cat cat said she touched it
32:44
could she run her fingers through woolly
32:47
hair i guess that's the way she wrote it
32:49
now i i need to make a slight
32:51
correction which i rarely do they said
32:54
white as wool white as well did not say
32:58
it was wool it is not woolly
33:00
he was talking about you know that was
33:02
something he could equate to back in
33:04
that day you have to understand you
33:06
think of the culture of the day
33:08
the sheep the sheep who were like the
33:10
pure sheep whether they their wall was
33:12
white it was extremely white and they
33:15
would stand out with their black faces
33:17
if you never actually saw a sheep you
33:18
should go look it up uh back in that day
33:21
their their their wool was very white
33:24
and it was highlighted by the black face
33:26
that they had black wolves and so maybe
33:29
you never thought about that but god's
33:30
hair is no way is it woolly jesus is not
33:33
wooly it said it was white as
33:37
because on the earth they couldn't have
33:38
anything else that they could at that
33:40
day think of to compare it to
33:43
his hair was not his hair was alive when
33:46
i touched it life shot into my arm it
33:49
shot up my
33:50
spiritual
33:52
and i'm always um
33:54
somebody had painted a painting of a
33:56
horse believe it or not with other
33:58
colors mixed in it but when i looked at
33:59
that picture
34:01
it i saw the face of god in it
34:05
and uh but i don't want to equate him to
34:07
looking like a horse but like the mane
34:09
on the horse was the most beautiful
34:11
hair i'd ever seen on a horse but
34:13
literally i don't think they realized
34:15
that they painted what was imposed over
34:18
that looked like the face of god i mean
34:20
it looked like
34:21
that
34:21
his eyes are flames of fire real flames
34:24
of fire but his hair uh the father's
34:26
hair is like longer than jesus's hairs
34:30
it's beautiful his fear is amazing but
34:33
life is in every part of his being and
34:36
when i barely touch the
34:38
strands of his hair i even now right now
34:41
having goosebumps taking him out
34:43
life was in his hair it was like moving
34:46
not moving a lot but it was moving
34:48
because it was life in it it was the
34:50
whitest white i'd ever seen light was
34:52
coming from it
34:54
and i'm sure that's why they tried to
34:56
describe him he said it was white as
34:58
wool
34:59
it's about the whitest white i've ever
35:00
seen and again because the father can do
35:04
what he wants to he can either let all
35:06
of the glory come from him where you see
35:08
nothing people been they haven't seen
35:10
nothing but
35:11
maybe images of eyes or the shape of a
35:13
head he has so much glory pouring from
35:16
him but he really wanted to establish to
35:18
me he has a body his arms his legs has a
35:21
torso even though he's got the spiritual
35:23
body it's real it's very real and he'll
35:27
reach out and he'll hold you when you
35:28
get to having them if he lays his hand
35:31
on you sometimes he'll just walk behind
35:32
me and lay his hand on me i get so
35:35
undone i'm talking about on the earth
35:36
sometimes he will come and just visit
35:39
him briefly and then leave and he
35:40
actually did that in the old testament
35:42
so it's not a strange thing
35:45
and you need to believe in your heart
35:47
that he cares enough about you he's
35:49
probably been with you and you didn't
35:50
even know it if he didn't make himself
35:52
visible
35:54
you maybe felt the presence so powerful
35:56
if you've ever been consumed by absolute
35:58
waves of love that would be the father
36:01
standing near you he is love his son
36:06
carries that love but he is love and and
36:09
but the light coming from the glory
36:11
coming from his hair and his whole uh
36:13
but he condemned that and sometimes when
36:16
you come home to heaven to stay he will
36:18
let you see his face he'll let you see
36:20
the flames of fire that's his passion
36:23
burning for you but his hair it wasn't
36:25
woolly and it never said it was it said
36:28
white
36:29
so it's extremely white it's kind of
36:30
long it is is wavy but like i said the
36:34
waves of his hair
36:37
and i just was so undone just to be even
36:40
near him
36:41
near him at the throne well you this
36:44
gave me two more questions that had just
36:46
occurred to me so i'm going to ask him
36:47
um
36:49
have has jesus ever come to you
36:52
in the form of the line of the tribe of
36:54
judah and if he's coming to you in the
36:56
form of a lion have you can you see his
36:59
jesus face in that lies it seemed like
37:01
what you just described the father's
37:03
face and the horse or whatever um
37:06
almost never has he come in the in the
37:09
no he's just come in person okay
37:11
i mean like you're seeing me i yeah
37:13
because you know he has his he's
37:15
immortal he has his body he has his body
37:18
back from the grave he's got that body
37:20
you can literally put your hands in the
37:22
actually the the the holes are here oh
37:24
wow if they had been here it would have
37:26
pulled off on the cross you know that
37:28
nail could have that the holes are right
37:30
here and if if you're with him
37:33
in heaven somewhere and a breeze blows
37:36
you can see those marks still
37:38
still in the head where the crown of
37:40
thorns were
37:41
but he's so
37:43
amazingly powerful he sat next to me in
37:46
my own home and put his arm around me
37:49
i thought it was gonna melt into the
37:52
of all the things he said on my loveseat
37:54
i'll never get rid of that loveseat okay
37:56
never ever ever
37:58
get on it and feel his presence today
38:00
wow
38:02
when it my home is in stores right now
38:04
because we'll be moving whoever sat on
38:06
it could feel his presence just come up
38:08
around them so
38:11
his anointing and his presence is so
38:13
tangible a lot of people said i never
38:16
could see him if he visited him as i
38:18
felt him i felt him put his arms around
38:20
me
38:21
it's one of the most glorious things and
38:23
in heaven you can see him whenever you
38:24
want to but i've seen him in person he's
38:27
not like i would say he's not a pretty
38:29
boy he's a strong
38:31
looking uh
38:33
god he's strong
38:34
and he does still have muscle
38:37
um
38:38
his physical body
38:40
he was a carpenter okay his hands looked
38:42
like they were the hands of a carpenter
38:44
but if man i'm just telling you just
38:46
want to be near him i could just say
38:48
that
38:49
that's amazing now a minute ago you said
38:52
um and i never thought this until you
38:54
just said it you said
38:56
something like he might have even you're
38:58
talking about he the lord your father
39:00
might have even been with you but you
39:02
didn't know it was him and i'm thinking
39:03
wait a minute is it possible that the
39:05
father visits every one of his kids in
39:08
person
39:09
i think probably at some time in their
39:11
life he probably did
39:14
interesting you have to remember he is
39:16
the father the father he was your
39:18
original father no matter who raised you
39:20
on the earth he is the number one father
39:23
to you because he carried you in him he
39:26
carried you lived in him there's no if
39:28
you could look inside god you would not
39:30
see there's no distance in him there's
39:32
no back to him on the inside this
39:35
glorious river of life and stones of
39:37
fire and little spirits of life playing
39:40
in there that's where you were so he
39:42
carried you before he sent you to this
39:45
earth and planted you you know in in the
39:48
womb of the the mother he he
39:51
carried you and put you like a seed in
39:53
there and uh and then you grew but he
39:56
wants you to know him i can tell you
39:58
that's why jesus's greatest thing
40:00
himself was he what he talked we talked
40:02
about the father all the time because he
40:04
loves the father
40:06
and that was one of his biggest topics
40:08
was talking about the father and
40:09
mentioned him he said he even said
40:11
there's none good but god he was talking
40:12
about his father he was good but to him
40:16
he's the greatest that the father would
40:18
be the greatest to him
40:19
awesome all right this is kind of a fun
40:22
question carla is asking this you know
40:24
there's that thing i live in texas for a
40:25
while you know they say texas there's a
40:27
saying when you live in texas that texas
40:29
is a is a whole other country you know
40:32
they call it a whole other country so
40:33
here's maybe that's what's in this
40:35
carla's mind she says is there a place
40:37
in heaven that is like texas
40:40
i would love to get into her mind and
40:43
say what is she looking for you know
40:45
she absolutely is right there is a place
40:48
like texas
40:50
there's a place that's got um
40:52
the same terrain
40:56
back in this day in this day like i'm in
40:58
the future talking
40:59
um
41:01
on the earth you would say oh there's
41:04
herds of wild horses running around in
41:06
texas it's beautiful the river you know
41:09
the the i don't want to name rivers
41:11
because i'm not so good with topography
41:13
or geography down here on the earth and
41:15
having them really good with it
41:17
but but you would see certain things in
41:20
texas in the state of texas there's a
41:22
strength in texas
41:24
uh there's a frequency in texas itself
41:26
that god made of freedom he actually
41:29
planted freedom in texas
41:31
and uh not that he didn't put it
41:33
somewhere else but some there's some
41:34
states or some regions or even some
41:36
countries he actually put more of
41:38
something in the foundation of that
41:40
whole area and texas wears freedom it
41:44
does they had to fight for their own
41:46
freedom back in the day and by the way
41:48
they wouldn't mind doing it right now
41:52
but in this part i know because we're
41:55
just going to go crazy right now we're
41:56
going to probably get people's people
41:58
going to love all this and they won't
41:59
i've seen people went home to to texas
42:04
it's a whole lot of the west who live in
42:07
this western that looks like the west
42:10
and not wild though maybe the holy
42:12
spirit would show up he'd be wild but
42:15
but there are areas in in heaven that
42:17
look like the west they just are and
42:20
someone in particular i have seen
42:23
absolutely in heaven would be john wayne
42:25
i don't mind dropping names people i've
42:27
seen him there what is he doing making
42:30
cowboy movies what did he do on the
42:31
earth all right you use your gift in
42:34
heaven and i saw him making a cowboy
42:37
movie uh in this place that looks just
42:39
like the west except there's no bandits
42:41
okay you're not gonna roast get scorched
42:43
be bit by scorpions none of that happens
42:46
so in your natural mind you always go to
42:48
well this is there and it's not there
42:50
it's a glorious beautiful place but it
42:52
looks just like the west and i happen to
42:54
know he lives in this part
42:56
john wayne lives in that part of heaven
42:58
he loves that part of heaven it's got
43:00
rivers running through it off of the
43:02
crystal sea but it to me when i saw it
43:05
looked like the west
43:06
and so yes there is areas that look like
43:08
the west there's places that look like
43:10
it snows all the time
43:12
that has fall all the time and like i
43:15
love what the hell the father explained
43:16
to me why we have seasons here
43:19
we have a season you know that comes and
43:21
goes right like the winter
43:23
spring comes and goes but in heaven they
43:26
are like that all the time and the
43:28
father said when i made the seasons on
43:30
the earth i took a shadow of four of my
43:33
favorite places in heaven more than four
43:36
don't say i said there's four places i
43:38
took a shadow of four of my favorite
43:40
places in heaven and put on the earth as
43:42
seasons
43:44
wow that's amazing that is amazing now i
43:47
got to ask you this because there's
43:48
something you just said you said you're
43:50
not so good with the topography down
43:52
here as you are in heaven
43:54
which begs the question you've been
43:56
there so many times if you were to sit
43:58
with a piece of paper
44:00
could you draw out this is where this is
44:03
and this is over
44:05
as as if it was a kind of map would you
44:08
know where you have your orientation of
44:09
where you are
44:11
you know steve you've heard me say many
44:12
times heaven is the world
44:15
that's why the earth is round hello flat
44:17
earth people forget it
44:19
heaven is the world it's around it's a
44:22
round or
44:24
if the earth was made of the shadow of
44:26
heaven then the earth would have to be
44:29
round because heaven is
44:31
so the father's house that jesus talked
44:33
about in my father's house so many
44:35
mansions
44:36
and people have for ages try to picture
44:38
how many mansions can you get in a
44:40
building
44:43
because your mind is earthbound right
44:45
the the house that the father calls it
44:47
it's a whole world it's a whole world
44:49
and i pretty much could draw kind of
44:51
what's at one of the tops and what's i
44:53
can tell you what's on the bottom of the
44:54
world called heaven that's michael's
44:56
headquarters oh really really yeah
44:59
because they're saying they're sending
45:00
them to the earth it makes sense right
45:02
it's what it's way up beyond anything
45:04
you can see
45:06
you're not going to find heaven with no
45:08
no telescope and no no a satellite or
45:11
anything you will ever see heaven
45:13
because it's a spiritual world a literal
45:16
place where you live literally in your
45:18
spiritual body uh it's an unseen it says
45:21
that what was made that is seen was made
45:24
by that what was unseen so there's a lot
45:26
of activity up there in the spirit realm
45:28
uh that you in your mind couldn't even
45:30
possibly imagine but but god from where
45:34
he sits can see everything it actually
45:36
says the earth is his footstool
45:39
so you know he had to shrink himself to
45:41
come and walk on me yeah well right
45:44
but he had to shrink himself and where
45:46
are his foot touched the mountains they
45:48
set on fire there was a fire so if you
45:51
think he's unaware of what's going on
45:52
you don't know him
45:54
yeah
45:55
so yeah so this earth is a shadow and a
45:59
type of what is in heaven
46:01
but also even the way he made it so
46:03
there's mountains there's rivers there's
46:05
an ocean in heaven called the crystal
46:07
sea
46:08
um there's there's the there's places
46:11
that look like the west it looked like
46:12
the north it looked like
46:14
uh the south there's places that look
46:16
like spring okay
46:18
there's many places what i could do and
46:20
actually have sketched myself in a lot
46:23
of my journals and one day we will
46:26
actually make a movie we are going to
46:28
make a movie it would take you to these
46:30
little places in heaven that i was shown
46:32
i don't think i connect i could connect
46:34
the whole world together but there are
46:36
places and i know what's near them those
46:39
i could do something like that awesome
46:42
awesome yeah
46:43
it never occurred to me that you i know
46:46
you might if you were going to walk it
46:48
or fly it on your own go down here turn
46:50
left here
46:52
i mean you would know certain places you
46:54
would know where they are maybe i never
46:56
i always have people with me so i don't
46:58
get lost in the airport okay yeah i do
47:01
remember that i remember seeing your
47:03
husband take you by the arm through the
47:05
airport you walked right past this we
47:07
were
47:08
okay uh this person
47:11
lin for christ is their username they
47:12
want to know what what is the book of
47:15
records i don't know if that's
47:17
i don't know if there's a if you've just
47:19
talked about that i'm not sure if that's
47:21
the bible term of book of records she
47:23
wants to know what's the book of records
47:25
there are so many books
47:27
i couldn't name them all you think he
47:30
doesn't have one here's my birthday's
47:32
right
47:32
the father is a writer okay
47:35
the lord was the orator he the the lord
47:37
likes to speak he doesn't care to write
47:40
things i just know that about jesus even
47:42
when he was learning the torah he loved
47:44
to read read read he didn't like so much
47:46
to write things that's just the way he
47:48
was but the father is definitely a
47:50
writer he loves to write record in old
47:54
school it was old school to be
47:57
timeless school i guess you'd have to
47:58
say it's timeless he loves to write in
48:01
books there's the lamb's book of life
48:03
that's a whole different one he has a
48:05
book of remembrance that's a whole
48:06
different book
48:08
but there are things that are recorded
48:09
there's actually a hall of records
48:11
there's a whole hall where things have
48:13
been recorded over time
48:15
accurately recorded by him
48:18
so there's a whole hall of records
48:20
there's one that pertains to you
48:21
yourself and things in your life there's
48:24
there's your own book he wrote i wrote i
48:26
wrote you know your your book for you
48:29
every day of your life he wrote it in a
48:31
book that's a whole separate book that's
48:32
just for you so there are books of
48:35
records there's a hall of records um
48:38
there's so many different places to go
48:39
and see and be be a part of in heaven
48:43
you'd have to be here for eternity to
48:45
even begin to be part of it um but
48:48
there's beautiful places that record
48:50
things there's different ways no things
48:52
are like we would say video audio they
48:54
don't call that in heaven they just
48:56
things are captured
48:58
they capture things and say that you
49:01
don't say they read they don't record
49:02
they capture them
49:04
which when they capture something or
49:06
they have retained something it's what
49:09
it felt like what it smelled like what
49:12
was said what was done really uh it was
49:14
very accurate but for he for himself
49:17
he does have a book of remembrance
49:19
that's his favorite book to write in so
49:21
he he doesn't have to but he does it
49:24
because he wants to do it and he
49:26
remembers every kind thing let's just go
49:28
there every kind wonderful thing you've
49:31
done for him every person you've helped
49:33
every person you fed every time you uh
49:36
picked up a wounded animal i mean animal
49:38
health whatever it was it was kindness
49:41
he records and remembers that
49:44
and then when you pray
49:46
when you pray and say father uh i really
49:49
would like to have this or i need this
49:51
now he goes back to your book and
49:52
remember says look at all the kind
49:54
things they did for me look how they
49:56
treated this person even when they
49:57
weren't nice so i can tell you
50:00
that's good there are books of records
50:03
halls of records in heaven so and but
50:05
much of it is very beautiful wonderful
50:07
things it's not always like they're
50:09
writing every bad deed done when you get
50:11
born again that's kind of like wiped out
50:14
if you if you repent for your sins it's
50:17
like you never did them you need to
50:19
remember that and you've been sinning
50:20
lately please go again again
50:23
please repent again god didn't never
50:25
give us the ability to freely sin once
50:28
you get saved people actually believe
50:30
that and some even teach that he never
50:32
said that it said since grace of balance
50:35
should sin also bound in god's head god
50:38
forbid so because there's grace for
50:41
eternal life and grace for forgiving you
50:44
that doesn't mean you should just live a
50:46
sinful life you're not you're not doing
50:48
anything good for god even for yourself
50:50
or your destiny so we're just kind of
50:52
went there because of the record thing
50:54
but when you do repent no matter what
50:57
you've done you sincerely repent god
51:00
wipes it away and doesn't remember it
51:02
because remember the books of
51:03
remembrance are the good things right
51:06
the book of records might be other
51:07
things and when you pretend that part is
51:10
wiped out that's like that you never
51:12
know
51:13
and you said that they don't use the
51:15
word video and audio but they capture it
51:17
and it's like a 3d
51:18
movie video thing yeah
51:21
in our language but if a person goes to
51:23
heaven and wants to look at their life
51:25
and they're not going to see sin that
51:26
was forgiven or they wouldn't even be
51:28
there but would they be able to see
51:30
things like that time they went through
51:32
an intersection and an angel came and
51:34
did this to this car and would that kind
51:36
of thing be recorded
51:38
it would be recorded but also would be
51:40
all the funny silly things you did
51:44
like like like what like when you were
51:46
in your pre-teens in your early days the
51:50
wow like you know i'm gonna jump this
51:52
canal like he will
51:53
see how that worked out and of course it
51:55
would be miserably fail but you wouldn't
51:57
get hurt but funny silly things you did
52:00
you will see that you actually go to
52:02
these they actually have a place where
52:04
your friends and your own family when
52:07
you get to heaven you're not going to
52:08
escape seeing that movie because they're
52:10
going to take you to see it
52:11
and uh it'll be delightful this is like
52:14
the silly things you did that he rescued
52:16
you with like
52:18
sometimes you didn't get rescued
52:21
you know maybe some of the fashion of
52:23
the day when you dress like i don't know
52:25
emcee hammer or something
52:27
would they show things like
52:30
um i love anthony by the way he's a very
52:33
cool person yeah yeah um would they show
52:36
things like um
52:38
how the lord when they show how he
52:42
talked to this
52:44
person to come share the gospel like
52:46
that where they would show how he got a
52:48
hold of how your life was
52:50
apprehended through the through other
52:52
people would they show that kind of
52:53
thing i think you definitely
52:55
i think you probably absolutely see that
52:57
i know that you will see this is what
52:59
you do see
53:00
you see your life relive with the
53:02
operations of the spirit realm from
53:04
heaven's perspective oh
53:06
every time your life was rescued every
53:09
time uh a god intervened that you didn't
53:12
know about you'll see all of that okay
53:16
very cool very very good born again of
53:17
course when you get born again but once
53:19
when you see yourself get bored again
53:21
you will flash up to heaven in the video
53:24
or this movie and you'll see how all of
53:26
heaven celebrated including father's day
53:29
when you got born again
53:31
how they celebrated yeah yes yeah that's
53:34
always been a hard one maybe you've seen
53:36
what you're talking about but
53:38
on the earth there could be a in a given
53:40
day even though we've heard of so
53:44
many people get saved in china and
53:46
underground church but there could be
53:47
hundreds of thousands of people getting
53:49
saved today coming to the lord and yet
53:52
when i see that scripture it says
53:53
there's more joy in heaven over one
53:55
sinner who repents and and so how does
53:58
it seems like
53:59
heaven would be constantly in a state of
54:01
celebration maybe it is how do they all
54:04
have a rejoice is it that is that what
54:06
they're doing is constantly celebrating
54:13
well
54:14
they do celebrate all the time people
54:16
and especially their families or friends
54:18
or something like they're really going
54:19
to celebrate uh that their family member
54:22
got born again oh they can't stop
54:24
talking about they go all over heaven
54:25
and talk about even for the people
54:26
really really celebration is such in
54:29
their heart knowing that forever they'll
54:30
be together for eternity so it is a big
54:32
thing it's a big thing to know that your
54:34
family members got born again so
54:37
to use it in a practical way uh let's
54:39
say i and my wife uh went to heaven one
54:42
you know events different times now
54:43
we're friends and uh maybe our
54:46
grandchild was not was walking away from
54:48
the lord okay a grandchild now they're
54:50
all just babies almost
54:52
but if
54:53
at the time when that grandchild comes
54:56
to the lord
54:57
i'm running up to drain or she's running
54:59
up to me and said did you hear
55:02
so and so got saved right is it kind of
55:04
like that
55:05
huh well actually what what actually
55:08
happens is the father lets you know
55:10
right before it happens and you watch it
55:13
you go to this
55:14
design where you can look down on the
55:16
earth and you declare over your family
55:17
members and stuff and there's like these
55:20
columns around heaven and when someone's
55:22
face comes up on these different columns
55:25
or like big monitors they know on those
55:27
columns when it comes up they're about
55:29
to get born again so they will run into
55:31
one of these portals that are
55:33
huge places you walk you run up these
55:35
steps and look over the balcony you
55:36
actually can watch your family members
55:38
getting born again
55:39
then the whole place breaks it the whole
55:41
place celebrates every time so if you're
55:43
there with a thousand people watching
55:45
the family members you can imagine the
55:46
celebration going on if they're all
55:48
there to watch their family members get
55:50
born again yeah well it's like they're
55:52
all looking down but they're sitting
55:53
down
55:54
wow okay uh this person wants
55:58
to know can you command demons out of
56:01
somebody without the permission of the
56:02
person you're praying for and i guess
56:05
i mean that's deliverance so i don't
56:06
know if there's a special
56:08
what they have in their mind whether
56:09
it's a ministry setting
56:12
you can certainly
56:14
cast a demon out of somebody right
56:16
without their permission i'm not sure
56:18
it actually says in the bible that's
56:20
what christ gives us the power to cast
56:22
out demons you know he says that right
56:23
he says that so anywhere where you are
56:26
if you're in authority if you have the
56:28
understanding of what's going on usually
56:31
the holy spirit will move on you to
56:33
he'll just say cast out that demon and
56:34
you will do in jesus name i i've done it
56:37
many times in different places and it
56:39
didn't even have to be like a church
56:40
setting it didn't and that wasn't
56:42
anything that was planned um you know
56:44
outside of a theater or something and if
56:47
if it manifests that means if you see it
56:49
the manifestation of one you you have
56:52
every right and authority to cast that
56:54
demon out
56:56
lots of times people aren't even in
56:57
control of their own mind anymore you
56:59
absolutely have the right to cast that
57:01
demon out there are some people who have
57:03
them and want them and i know that
57:05
sounds awful but they do and they know
57:06
what they are
57:09
and then they want it you expound what
57:12
do you mean cat they want them
57:15
when they know that they're demons what
57:17
do you mean they want them can you be
57:19
more specific
57:21
well i i i don't know
57:24
about the darkness today but i will just
57:25
say they they talk about people who who
57:28
were there's a difference by the way
57:30
there's a huge difference in being
57:32
influenced by demons and being possessed
57:35
by demons okay oh what we're talking
57:38
about the casting out is someone who has
57:40
one living in them and you that may
57:43
freak you out but jesus lives in you
57:45
okay jesus when you got born again he
57:46
stepped on the inside of you he lives
57:48
there people watch what you're saying
57:51
i always like to say give jesus a good
57:52
day give your angels a good day your
57:54
angels were sent to be with you they're
57:56
also present they're also there uh no
57:59
matter where where you are your angels
58:01
are seen i mean they're seen by each
58:03
other of course
58:04
as a seer you see all this going on
58:06
around you is i have to focus sometimes
58:08
when i go in a place because i'm seeing
58:10
all this
58:11
i'm seeing people's angels i'm seeing
58:13
demons that are trying to speak to
58:14
people they'll try to whisper things in
58:16
your ear that aren't gone that's being
58:18
influenced by one okay a possession is a
58:22
as a whole totally different thing they
58:23
probably can't even think on their own
58:26
or do normally even natural everyday
58:28
things needed for them to live in a
58:30
situation like that
58:33
you better know the power of god you
58:34
better not have sin in you and try to
58:36
cast a demon
58:38
you just need to know that's not going
58:40
to remember the seven sons of skiva go
58:41
back to the bible uh they thought
58:43
because they saw you know all of them
58:45
cast demons out they thought they could
58:47
do the same thing and the demon came out
58:49
and jumped on them i'm not trying to
58:50
scare you i'm just saying what's
58:51
biblical you can't live a life of sin
58:55
even as a christian which sounds crazy
58:57
and think you're going to cast demons
58:59
out they're going to come after you
59:02
so
59:02
if you're operating if you're operating
59:04
and righteously and you have authority
59:06
and you know you have authority and a
59:08
situation like that that would be the
59:09
most natural thing for me to say i cast
59:11
you out in jesus name get out
59:14
he had me do that in a whole
59:15
congregation and this whole massive
59:17
congregation of like 700 people three
59:20
demons literally ran out of the people
59:23
and those people were set free instantly
59:26
from the
59:27
the the the the demon that had
59:30
controlled them either they gave
59:32
themselves to it and i'm saying you
59:34
cannot just go play around in the
59:36
darkness people you should not have an
59:38
ouija board i am sorry that's how you
59:40
contact me you don't want one of those
59:42
you don't want to mess with witchcraft i
59:44
just have to be honest if you want to be
59:46
full of god in these days and walk in
59:49
great authority you don't have to be a
59:51
prophet to do that you do need to know
59:54
who you are in christ and who christ is
59:56
and you walk to please him you you have
59:59
authority over the darkness the bible
60:02
says so you do and there's a whole list
60:05
of things that you have the right to do
60:06
as a believer it doesn't have to be
60:09
necessarily a five-fold person in the
60:11
ministry you as a righteous person have
60:13
great authority in the earth
60:16
but you can't play in the enemy's camp
60:18
in other words you can't decide well i'm
60:20
a born-again believer you know i'm
60:21
operating i'm reading my word i'm i'm
60:23
declaring things and and then decide to
60:26
go to some wicked evil science party
60:30
a guest
60:32
and that guest you wouldn't want with
60:33
you i'm not talking about a physical one
60:35
so you need to you need to be
60:36
accountable for your life and actions
60:38
when you get to the age of
60:39
accountability
60:42
that means you know the difference and
60:43
you know what's right or wrong don't
60:45
play with the darkness
60:47
okay if you want to be safe and powerful
60:49
don't play with darkness um you just
60:52
don't want to do that and i don't even
60:53
know how we got into all that yeah but
60:55
as far as casting demons out we we have
60:58
authority to do that jesus those who
61:00
followed him believed in him who had
61:02
repented of the sins was living
61:04
righteously they had the right to do
61:05
that
61:06
and remember the one man he cast all the
61:08
demons out and prayed over him and then
61:09
he sent him to do the same thing because
61:11
he'd received christ
61:13
but you need to know who you are who
61:15
christ is who is christ
61:17
he made everything that ever existed
61:20
that does exist and will ever exist
61:22
that's who he is
61:24
when you give yourself to him you get
61:26
everything with him you're not giving up
61:29
your few little sins you had or you feel
61:31
little things you like to do and play in
61:34
you're getting a life eternal
61:36
to one day being immortal
61:38
and this is what you're giving yourself
61:40
to it's not just oh no i have to read a
61:42
bible it's not that it's who are you
61:45
giving yourself to because one way or
61:47
the other you're going to participate in
61:49
the darkness or you're going to be in
61:50
the light with jesus christ so i would
61:53
say
61:54
run after him
61:55
get along and say i want to know you
61:57
jesus i want to know you more i want to
61:58
know about you i'm going to be like you
62:01
you're going to start having his
62:02
presence show up because of what you're
62:04
saying okay
62:06
what you say matters in this world
62:09
and so don't be bashing trashing
62:12
swearing profanity is how's language
62:14
people i'm sorry i don't tolerate don't
62:16
ever swear about me don't swear around
62:18
me i'll cast that on you that's good all
62:21
right now i think i may know where this
62:23
came from but let's see okay so you said
62:25
you said in the past everything in
62:27
heaven is alive
62:29
the flowers don't die the grass is alive
62:31
things like that and this person may
62:33
have heard that but maybe i don't know
62:35
if you said the angels took care of the
62:37
flowers but this person says what do
62:39
angels have to do when they take care of
62:40
the flowers do they have to water weed
62:43
fertilize so i don't know what you might
62:45
have said did you say the angels take
62:47
care of them
62:48
okay so what did they do they care for
62:51
them uh they'll go and sing
62:54
they'll release the life of god
62:57
they'll go visit them i mean there's
62:59
there are some that their assignment and
63:01
there's some that care for the
63:02
waterfalls there's ones that care for
63:05
the meadows and the flowers and the
63:07
creatures
63:08
god doesn't have to feed them it's not
63:11
the physical food you're thinking on
63:14
you're connected to earth okay i'm
63:16
talking about heaven
63:17
the life of god feeds everything in
63:20
heaven you eat in heaven because you
63:22
love to eat you don't eat because you
63:24
have to do it to live
63:26
so these these things he made
63:28
that he imparts the life life of god or
63:32
joy they may bring waves of joy to whole
63:34
meadows and the flowers begin to sing
63:36
with joy so there's things that they're
63:38
assigned to do in heaven but it's never
63:40
going to be the fertilizer fertilizer
63:42
they're not going to dig and put plants
63:44
in there okay
63:46
uh if you're a gardener in heaven you'll
63:48
speak and plants will begin to come up
63:50
on the ground oh wow you're gardening
63:52
with your with your mouth
63:54
by speaking
63:55
new things
63:57
that's right very cool very cool very
63:59
cool um here's one i don't know if this
64:01
is a child or not but i know that's a
64:03
serious question but this is does anyone
64:06
go to heaven and not like it
64:10
and now do they what
64:13
no does anyone go to heaven
64:17
there is not one single person who's
64:19
ever moved to heaven and lived there
64:22
and not liked it okay there's so many
64:25
things i don't even have time to tell
64:27
about or share about that exist there
64:30
you're living in an atmosphere of joy
64:34
there's nothing in you that would
64:35
despise or not like it's not even in you
64:39
i know in your head you can't understand
64:41
that because i know you go to a store
64:43
and you go i don't like that outfit but
64:44
i like that one no i would never wear
64:46
that but i sure would like to own that
64:48
it isn't like that in heaven okay you
64:50
love everything you have your favorites
64:52
or you'll go to different places to get
64:54
favorite things that you like because
64:55
everything's just given to you things
64:57
are created to me but it's given to you
64:59
but you're not ever going to say i don't
65:01
like living here
65:03
that is impossible
65:05
you are so filled every bar
65:07
part of your being is filled with the
65:09
life and love of god and
65:11
if anything you love more
65:14
you love your family more you love god
65:16
more you love his house the world called
65:18
heaven you love everything about it you
65:20
get to go on tours and nothing costs
65:23
anything there's no money in heaven uh
65:25
everything is freely given people share
65:27
the gift that they are that they were on
65:29
the earth that only they use it in more
65:31
fantastic ways than they would like an
65:33
artist doesn't just have to paint on a
65:35
canvas their paint floats in the air
65:37
whatever they use to make things it's
65:38
just there they paint with light they
65:41
paint the sky of heaven and it's there
65:43
for a while then it fades and they paint
65:45
something else
65:46
there's no what there's no way you could
65:48
not love being there yeah that's amazing
65:50
all right let's do this this is the last
65:52
one but this is a good one um never
65:54
heard this one but this is this is to
65:56
you cat christie's asking on one of your
65:59
visits to heaven kat have you ever had a
66:02
family dinner with father son and holy
66:05
spirit what did the conversation can
66:07
sound like
66:09
i i've never had a dinner with all three
66:11
of them
66:12
i haven't
66:14
i have visited with them separately and
66:16
they've taken me different places in
66:18
heaven i've i've spent i not i don't
66:20
think i ever ate with any of them okay i
66:23
think i've been in a bakery with jesus
66:25
one time just because he was showing it
66:27
to me he loves sweets yeah every baker
66:30
that comes to heaven he's going to visit
66:31
their shop
66:34
really great i've been in the the i've
66:36
been in the um mansion that is jesus
66:39
christ has his own why wouldn't he he
66:42
lived on the earth as a person okay
66:44
he served god while he was here on the
66:46
earth he has his own yes he's in the
66:49
throne room a lot but he also has his
66:50
own place what does he do he throws
66:53
events there invites people just come
66:55
home to heaven and let them meet all the
66:56
prophets and all the stuff i've been
66:58
there and all he served was desserts
67:01
people so i hope you like dessert you
67:02
had every kind of dessert imaginable on
67:05
this glorious mansion
67:08
and when you walk through the flowers
67:10
are so high they're all greeting you
67:12
you come in this beautiful carriage
67:15
and then he sent for you to invite you
67:17
to his place and there's people there
67:19
you probably always wanted to meet if
67:21
you said i always wanted to meet elijah
67:23
i always wanted to meet queen esther i
67:24
wanted to see david they would
67:26
definitely be there for you and then you
67:28
would all enjoy desserts on these tables
67:31
and he's going to have dancing like
67:34
beautiful dancing and i know in your
67:36
mind you're thinking all these different
67:38
styles of dance depending on what you
67:39
like there's nothing defiling there's
67:41
nothing degrading in heaven but
67:43
beautiful um they dance all over heaven
67:46
all the time usually from joy from
67:47
celebration but everything you you
67:50
usually think about is equated to what
67:52
is in the what's in the in the um
67:55
i'm trying to think of an earth ward
67:57
right now
67:59
they would compromise the area this is
68:02
the best i could do of the throne room
68:05
and even that would be hard for you to
68:07
do if you have not been there the throne
68:08
room is alive it gets huge it grows it's
68:12
round the throne is in the middle of the
68:15
throne room it's high and lifted up
68:17
there's like platforms columns platforms
68:19
columns and there's people and all
68:20
different they're either worshiping or
68:22
dancing or leaving sweets for jesus
68:25
seriously all the way up the steps to
68:27
where this massive throne is the father
68:30
sits and his son sits next to him
68:32
uh you have to walk past these living
68:34
creatures that are so stunning
68:40
to get up there and your eyes cannot
68:42
contain
68:43
uh so it's not like there's little small
68:46
spaces and there's no place for you it's
68:48
not like that you begin to worship
68:49
everybody raises up off the floor the
68:51
seraphim come down out of the glory
68:53
cloud and they're on fire with passion
68:55
and love for them with sin on the throne
68:58
there's no way you couldn't love being
69:00
in this place and so anyone who has
69:02
someone there
69:03
don't ever feel sorry for them that
69:06
they're living
69:08
they're existing to live
69:11
you never die
69:12
there's no thoughts of death there's no
69:14
thoughts of harm nobody's ever sick
69:16
nobody lacks
69:18
everybody still wants to help one
69:19
another with their events and stuff like
69:21
that there's joy celebration no one is
69:23
rejected no one's rejected
69:26
everybody is cared about and loved
69:28
and and the creatures you also can get
69:31
to know all the creatures that they are
69:32
not talking about the living creatures
69:34
they're too busy i'm talking about
69:36
creatures all over the world called
69:38
heaven and the friendly forest is why
69:40
they call it that in the valley of the
69:42
falls uh
69:43
there's just so many beautiful places
69:45
and fun places i can't leave out the fun
69:48
okay
69:49
so no matter what when you know someone
69:51
who's going and you know they're going
69:53
i celebrate
69:55
and i've been celebrating over marcus
69:57
lamb recently
70:00
a great man and woman of god have gone
70:02
home to heaven my whole heart is so full
70:04
for them of the glory they will
70:06
experience just being in the presence um
70:09
of the father of the son
70:11
and holy spirit is still there people i
70:13
know his base of operations is on the
70:15
earth so don't even go there with me the
70:17
holy spirit is an unlay unlimited
70:20
layered being
70:21
i hope that does something to your
70:23
natural head
70:24
unlimited layers of himself doesn't mean
70:26
there's a million of them standing
70:27
around it's not like he's here there's a
70:29
million of them around him it's not like
70:30
that
70:31
the way that he is
70:33
he has unlimited layers of himself where
70:35
he sends that layer of him that looks
70:37
just like him and is him he knows
70:40
everything there here's everything there
70:42
so when you invite the holy spirit to
70:44
indwell you guess what you don't get a
70:46
piece of him you get a whole of him in
70:48
you that's good good good good
70:51
yeah so when the holy spirit you know
70:53
he's when the holy spirit lives in you
70:56
that's not some euphemism or poetry it
70:59
means he himself
71:02
is there uh we would we would use the
71:04
word in bodily form except he's a spirit
71:07
being so it's not and he's killed him as
71:09
a body
71:10
yeah okay so spiritual body
71:13
he's literally there the person of the
71:15
holy spirit you get hold of him to
71:18
indwell you and let me tell you he
71:20
almost never stops talking to me he
71:22
talks again a lot most of the time you
71:24
hear him like out here speaking to you
71:27
um and sometimes he'll even say oh don't
71:29
turn there or don't go there or stop uh
71:32
that's usually saying him saying that to
71:34
you
71:35
even if it's in your spirit you hear him
71:38
but if you give him permission i want i
71:40
want to end with this you if you're born
71:42
again
71:43
and you're not spirit filled invite holy
71:45
spirit to indwell you you really must
71:47
it's the power of god in you it gets you
71:50
bold the power of god now lives in you
71:54
and you have access to that and you can
71:56
you need to say to the holy spirit i
71:58
give you permission to talk to me even
72:01
when i'm not paying attention
72:04
and if you say those words to him he'll
72:06
do it when when needed to protect you
72:09
when needed to encourage you he will and
72:12
and then you'll be the more you
72:14
recognize he is there
72:16
uh i talk to him like i do to jesus or
72:18
the father
72:19
um i've seen the outline of his being
72:21
he's very powerful looking too he's
72:23
outlined in fire he carries the fire of
72:26
god uh on him he is god
72:30
and uh they have the ability to step
72:31
inside of each other i've already been
72:33
in the throne and saw the father sitting
72:35
there jesus gets up and steps inside the
72:36
father the holy spirit comes
72:38
wherever there goes that steps inside
72:40
the father
72:42
and then the three in one
72:44
wow oh wow
72:45
a five-year-old could understand that a
72:48
five-year-old can understand the trinity
72:51
and yet man in their natural mind still
72:53
trying to figure out do they have three
72:54
heads how does this work
72:58
and then they step out and there they
72:59
are the three individual gods the
73:02
godhead
73:03
but one thing is for sure they love you
73:06
they care about you and they don't
73:08
like the darkness
73:12
that's good that's so good
73:14
cat wow that's so so good so so so good
73:16
all right well we got about a third of
73:18
the way through the questions because
73:20
i'm just enjoying it takes it longer
73:22
than i love it i love the time we spend
73:24
with each one but you know it's going to
73:26
take us another couple hundred shows
73:33
yeah he made me he picked me he made me
73:36
first of all
73:37
if you can imagine i'm so full of detail
73:40
that's why i have a photographic memory
73:42
so i never forget anything i saw heard
73:44
or experienced but i grew up like really
73:46
really
73:47
i was really i was high maintenance
73:50
because i knew things no one else knew
73:54
and the family i knew things that my
73:55
siblings were doing they didn't want me
73:57
to know um but i also knew what god was
74:01
saying and um so i was not normal even
74:03
when i was little i ate once a day i
74:05
slept four hours a day i was up all
74:07
night long
74:08
uh even young my mom would still always
74:11
been this way i thought that was new in
74:13
your life you've always been that way
74:15
huh but i'm a detailed person which is
74:17
good for god but when you're with
74:19
somebody trying to be over a project
74:21
or you're out picking something up from
74:23
the store
74:24
you're detailed then too
74:26
you know i'm sure that sharpens my
74:28
husband no i don't want that one it has
74:29
to have this slant has this this hue
74:32
this this tent this
74:34
is not over here i don't want that and
74:36
so i'm like that too so you get both of
74:39
me you get all of that i but but it
74:41
works well with heaven
74:43
that's why yeah well i mean you're a
74:44
revelator but you have a photographic
74:46
memory and you are a photographer
74:48
because to boot you i don't know
74:50
the verb forget details and while you're
74:53
not forgetting natural details you're
74:54
seeing supernatural all around you at
74:56
all times yes and i can't even i can't
74:59
even you know your brain must be
75:03
i mean
75:05
it's like living in two worlds
75:07
at the same time can't you are you um
75:10
here's let me use human
75:12
you know
75:13
terminology language
75:15
yeah while you're remembering in a in
75:17
your photographic memory now you're
75:20
seeing demons and angels and things as
75:21
you walk around the room and this cruise
75:23
ship or whatever are you recording and
75:25
not forgetting what those as well
75:28
do you remember what which entities were
75:30
doing what how how far does their memory
75:33
go well when i'm on the ship they try to
75:35
not be
75:36
there oh they do
75:39
well they already know me because they
75:41
know that i have this relationship with
75:43
jesus christ they know
75:44
uh they already know who i am i have
75:47
they they they have
75:49
blacklisted me
75:50
because they could get cast out
75:53
uh or i could say something that would
75:55
freak them out you know the spirit or
75:57
whatever uh and i won't tolerate when i
76:00
get up in the morning say i'm not
76:01
tolerating any of the darkness anywhere
76:02
near me i take power over all the power
76:04
of the enemy command the host of heaven
76:06
you will shred mesh bash and trash every
76:08
demon that even tries to come near me
76:10
shred platforms that have been built in
76:11
the spirit realm and some of those were
76:13
on cruise ships because for for whatever
76:16
reason
76:17
uh people got away with certain things
76:19
and then there's these spiritual
76:20
platforms they would be destroyed if i
76:22
was on that ship wow so so they don't
76:25
have maybe as much activity because i'm
76:28
in a captive place and there are
76:31
captives already if i am there
76:34
that's good well you know that's that's
76:36
a thing in scripture whereas it was paul
76:38
paul i know and such and such i know but
76:40
i didn't know don't know you so they do
76:43
know the high level
76:45
uh apostles prophets just holy people
76:48
men and women and children yes they do
76:51
is it such that when they get on this
76:53
cruise ship
76:55
they have a meeting and everyone knows
76:56
where the holy people are on the ship
76:58
how does it go
77:00
it's because of how much light you have
77:02
coming out of you okay
77:05
i mean they already know people who
77:07
don't have christ
77:09
uh it's not like they're not living
77:10
obviously their body's living but their
77:12
spirit man really doesn't have a lot of
77:14
life in it and sometimes they may follow
77:16
those people to see if they can get them
77:18
pulled into something but i take
77:20
authority over the whole ship
77:23
wow
77:24
wow
77:25
wow
77:26
yeah boy i would love to hear that you
77:28
know i'd love to go to heaven one day
77:29
and see what happened but i guess
77:31
the evil you don't see the evil replayed
77:34
that someone won i mean right
77:36
if you go to heaven you know the only
77:37
time you might see something like that
77:39
is if he allows you to see what your
77:41
prayers resulted in war without heaven
77:44
against the enemy i think he probably
77:46
it's not like it would really be there
77:48
it would be something that you would get
77:50
to see happen like in your life when
77:53
you're praying and you were praying for
77:54
somebody i think you do get to see the
77:57
destruction that your prayers called
77:59
calls again the enemy the spiritual
78:01
darkness i'd love to see that so i'd
78:03
like to see that now all right cat
78:05

78:06

80:38
going to say i will not tell you to go
80:39
give to some missionary camp those
80:41
people are trying to steal money from
80:42
you or they're saying that i said to
80:44
give to this group or for this cause
80:47
that's not me and i don't do it on
80:48
purpose because i don't want people
80:50
getting ripped off yeah so go to
80:52
category.com if you want to give and i
80:54
do want to end with this make sure you
80:56
are supporting elijah's an elijah
80:59
streams thank you like steve said they
81:03
they can't know every single person they
81:05
put on there but they do know if they
81:08
find out someone's not living right
81:10
that's what they're saying we're not
81:11
going to put them on there they're not
81:13
going to even promote them i wouldn't
81:14
either and sometimes people go through
81:17
stages of their life where they're not
81:18
hearing right or whatever reason
81:21
but i tell you god calls him a platform
81:24
for the prophets to speak for him
81:27
and if he cares about steve and he put
81:31
that in place then that is something
81:33
that is definitely valid to give to your
81:35
seating into the lives of millions of
81:38
people when you give to him and helping
81:40
to support his staff and future projects
81:43
like going to israel
81:46
if he ever does another tour of israel
81:47
make sure you get to go on that tour
81:49
it's amazing
81:50
and so many things we do
81:53
we speak for god we're not god but we
81:55
speak for him we allow him to speak
81:58
uh the best we possibly can because we
82:00
want you to know him want you to know
82:02
the truth the truth makes you free
82:05
not lies and deception so you have a
82:08
blessed day and yeah thank you kent i
82:10
think days definitely never stop
82:12
declaring declaration declaration is
82:15
still prayer declaring declaring and
82:17
decreeing over situations is still
82:19
prayer it's a really high level of
82:21

03:48
many people there are have not been

introduced to that and many people that
03:52
go there are not even saved but so
03:55
trying to figure out
03:57
from the lord which what are the best
03:59
things to say and show and tell
04:01
so that people can be initiated into the
04:03
prophetic so prayer is appreciated all
04:05
right let's bring kerr in here
04:08
hi
04:09
hi cat i guess for you it's good
04:11
afternoon it's about two to something
04:13
your time huh
04:15
yeah it's a little bit past morning for
04:17
me morning is noon
04:18
[Laughter]
04:20
yeah and it's about eleven
04:22
i guess we're yeah you're exactly three
04:24
hours ahead but well welcome to the
04:25
broadcast as you yeah as always uh
04:28
you're looking chipper as always so you
04:29
guys are still gonna are gonna move very
04:32
soon right to new offices or a new home
04:34
or what we're moving to a new home first
04:37
and after that uh margaret's already
04:39
been looking for office building we
04:41
can't start up with just something small
04:43
we we've gotten so huge inside where
04:45
we're at now
04:47
and so we're moving out first so we'll
04:49
be out all of our stuff will be out
04:51
because you know we've been
04:52
living here for 15 years actually where
04:55
we're at but the office took over about
04:58
six and a half years ago and then it
04:59
fastly it took over every room in in
05:02
this place so we call it the office not
05:04
even our home right now but we will be
05:06
moving
05:08
very shortly and then probably within a
05:10
few months after that we'll be moving
05:11
our offices yeah wow well you've really
05:14
been in a growth spurt so have we i mean
05:16
this year we
05:17
you and i saw a lot of growth didn't we
05:20
that was amazing and he would have grown
05:22
about the same time we did so we we just
05:24
kind of did it together didn't we
05:26
we did do it together it was god's plan
05:29
yeah it was it really really was we both
05:32
know it we both felt it we're both
05:34
experiencing it now so yeah well um go
05:37
ahead
05:38
go ahead people should understand i know
05:40
if you look around only at the world
05:43
what the world is seeing or even this
05:45
nation like i would say everyday people
05:48
uh a lot of people who are prophetic or
05:50
who just really prayer warriors
05:52
understand god's about to do something
05:54
powerful
05:55
and that's why the enemy is showing
05:57
himself off but as god says he's only
06:00
exposing himself people that's probably
06:02
as far as i'll go about that the enemy's
06:04
been exposing himself this whole last
06:06
year and a half and that makes them an
06:08
easy target
06:09
for god of course you know i'm talking
06:11
about god the god of heaven and earth
06:14
and he continued tells me
06:16
um that i have to be prepared for the
06:18
acceleration will be very quickly after
06:21
major things begin to happen
06:24
we want to keep this broadcast on here
06:26
so uh but you know i've been talking
06:28
about that all along people who've been
06:30
listening all along i'm so grateful for
06:32
your support for your prayers i know
06:34
steve is but god did actually plan this
06:36
together because it all started way back
06:38
you know back in 2019 this whole thing
06:41
kind of started what we're doing now
06:43
and um and god just knows what he's
06:45
doing that's what i can say i in my
06:48
spirit have so much celebration and
06:50
excitement in me i was with god last
06:53
night and my office right now is so
06:56
filled with him uh in here i i can't
06:59
help but have excitement on the inside
07:01
because that's that's how he feels and
07:03
so he says i have to have you into a
07:05
bigger place for you and your offices
07:08
have to be established uh so we're not
07:10
margaret i think we're thinking about
07:11
something smaller and god said no you're
07:13
gonna accelerate very quickly once you
07:15
leave here personally and when you leave
07:18
here in the offices it's it's about to
07:20
be very great these are great days for
07:23
people they're not the sad
07:26
fearful days
07:27
and you know speaking of how this all
07:29
happened to both of us this year i it's
07:31
very clear to me that
07:33
you know i call god one of his my names
07:35
for him is you know that's not like i
07:38
say dear manager but one of his
07:40
descriptions to me is he's a manager
07:41
i've asked him to manage my life and so
07:44
he literally withholds i mean he's
07:47
blessing the socks off of both of us but
07:49
he could do it he could even double it
07:51
right now but he knows you need that
07:52
often so he needs you to get into that
07:54
office into the home and until he just
07:56
goes
07:57
and it'll double triple quadruple you
07:59
know so yeah it will this is this is the
08:02
air this is the time and season and
08:04
years and breakthroughs where people are
08:07
need to hear the prophet's voice do you
08:09
sense that after the switch after the
08:12
right person is back in office
08:16
do you expect that people will need at
08:18
that point to have more prophetic words
08:20
or less prophetic words
08:22
i think they're going to begin to run
08:24
after the true prophetic
08:27
word of god that has been proven through
08:29
all of this that we've been going
08:30
through i already happen to know they
08:32
are literally going to run after people
08:34
to be near them to hear them it's going
08:36
to increase and not just that steve
08:39
salvations will begin to increase
08:42
greatly
08:43
not because it's the last day where
08:45
we're all out of here this is god
08:48
preparing for what's about to happen for
08:50
several generations of i know this also
08:53
that a lot of uh prophets are being born
08:56
right now as we speak uh in of course as
08:59
babies but they are prophets and god is
09:01
about to flood this world with the
09:04
prophetical and prophets so i hope
09:06
they're ready for that and i do know as
09:09
a parent who kind of raised one and
09:12
who's now a mentoring grandchildren who
09:14
are prophets wow they're not normal they
09:17
don't start out normal and they're going
09:19
to be very powerful let's say 10 20
09:22
years from now there'll be such powerful
09:24
voices in the earth we do need you steve
09:26
we do need the elijah's elijah streams
09:29
will be a known door opening for those
09:32
prophets who are really hearing god and
09:35
are living the life
09:36
it's going to happen we can't stop it
09:39
from happening
09:40
no one not anyone not spiritual or
09:42
physical in this realm or in the unseen
09:45
realm can stop from god from doing what
09:48
he's going to do you know and when god
09:51
god began to birth prophets even out in
09:53
the desert with moses to the extent that
09:56
a couple people started prophesying he
09:57
didn't have permission and they were
09:59
cattle on to moses and he goes what are
10:01
you jealous from my account he says what
10:03
that all god's people who are prophets
10:04
this whole desire and moses was himself
10:07
a prophet but he said with it all god's
10:09
people were prophets that was desire and
10:12
you know on on the amount of
10:13
transfigurations it was
10:16
moses the prophet he was also a little
10:18
law giver and he loved the prophet and
10:20
god you know what moses did on the earth
10:23
was important for him to say that was
10:25
super significant so
10:26
yeah well you know uh we're we're going
10:28
to jump into some questions about heaven
10:30
and related things anything else so make
10:32
sure we're giving you a chance to say
10:33
anything you were going to say before we
10:35
jump into those oh no that was it just
10:38
this acceleration that's going to happen
10:40
is why a lot of people i i'll just
10:43
repeat what god said
10:44
uh one day it will be hard to remember
10:48
these days we just went through except
10:50
the powerful part except the god part of
10:53
them uh we'll be doing so many powerful
10:55
things and you know it is god's heart
10:58
that all prophesy it says that that all
11:01
prophesied and my heart is everyone
11:04
knows the truth the truth comes from you
11:07
know jesus christ
11:08
he's the spirit of truth we know holy
11:10
spirit we know the father who all
11:12
revelation flows from it is there and
11:15
i'll just say there their heart that we
11:17
all know truth that we all hear him and
11:20
receive revelation because of the days
11:22
coming and all the flood of people
11:24
coming into the kingdom we'll have to
11:27
mentor them not
11:28
we not just me but the body of christ
11:30
will have to be at a level where they
11:32
can mentor these people uh coming on
11:34
board into the body of christ that's
11:36
good well
11:37
we're in it together this will be fun so
11:39
a lot of people if you're new and you've
11:41
not seen cat before cat over the last 20
11:43
some years maybe more a lot more than
11:46
that he has been to heaven and
11:48
thousands of times would that be about
11:49
accurate thousands of times that is very
11:52
accurate
11:53
so uh and i think one of my favorite
11:55
little clips from memory is he is a
11:58
visit to heaven might be you're in a
12:00
grocery store picking up a can of food
12:02
or something off the shelf by the time
12:04
you put your hand back down into the
12:06
basket you've been to heaven and back
12:08
and and they counter like
12:10
that might last how long and
12:13
how long would it seem a visit like that
12:16
lasted when you were there i think the
12:18
only way i can gauge that because they
12:20
don't have clocks in heaven anybody
12:22
there's no calendars or clocks in heaven
12:24
uh god does things according to events
12:28
actually his whole timeline that he has
12:30
behind his throne and embedded in the
12:31
floor of the throne is god's timeline
12:34
but it's done by events
12:36
that are planned down the earth it's not
12:38
like i know the hebrew calendar you can
12:40
tell me all about that that's still the
12:41
earth thing i'm talking about a heavenly
12:42
from a heavenly viewpoint god has events
12:46
already playing out he's already seen
12:47
him he's been there he already knows uh
12:49
what's gonna happen it's up to us to
12:51
choose to be a part of it but i only
12:53
know if i've been there uh a while is
12:56
how many places he shows me like if he
12:58
catches me up and he's talking to me
13:00
about a specific topic
13:02
or uh an event and then he shows it to
13:05
me he'll take me forward in time to show
13:07
me that event so i can talk very clearly
13:09
about the things that he's shown me and
13:11
then brings me back it probably wasn't
13:13
very long earth time um if i've taken to
13:16
three or four places which he can do and
13:19
with no time in heaven he can totally do
13:21
that but i realize while i've been there
13:24
for a while all those seconds in the
13:26
store have gone by i've been taking the
13:29
three four or even five places in heaven
13:31
that literally exists
13:33
and i could draw a map of those places i
13:35
literally could i've actually done that
13:36
a few times just for my
13:38
for myself i've actually drawn what's
13:40
around certain things in certain areas
13:42
of heaven
13:43
but one day we plan to have huge
13:45
displays
13:46
not just in our offices but we'll have
13:48
other places and um facilities where we
13:51
actually people can come and see things
13:53
happening as they when it looked like
13:55
when they happened in heaven what
13:56
happened literally looks like to walk
13:57
through it so it's a good thing i have
14:00
photographic memory yeah for sure for
14:02
sure by the way someone asked me a
14:04
question about your photographic memory
14:06
uh my my wife's
14:08
brother kind of has that and i'm sure
14:10
there's there's
14:11
there are degrees of photographic memory
14:14
does that mean that you never forget
14:17
anything or are there a certain type of
14:18
thing you always tend to remember it but
14:20
you can forget other things what does
14:22
that mean in your case
14:24
if it is regarding heaven i've never
14:26
forgotten any single time i've been
14:28
taken okay wow
14:31
wow wow
14:32
you could even identify that on that
14:34
particular trip you went down at the
14:36
different places i can i can't identify
14:38
it what it felt like what the aromas i
14:40
smelled uh the flavors i tasted uh what
14:44
the atmosphere was like what what what
14:46
it looked like what it felt like um what
14:49
other places what people were
14:51
experiencing there how they felt about
14:52
things how relationships happen how
14:54
transportation happens how heaven
14:56
operates
14:58
i could just go on and on because
15:00
he has shown me he sent me as a
15:02
revelator of heaven that's his title he
15:04
gave me and he takes me whenever he
15:07
wants to and i never say no
15:10
wow yeah i love that i love that
15:12
okay well let's jump into some questions
15:14
about heaven and these are some are
15:15
questions about heaven and others are
15:17
questions about things you understand
15:19
about the word because god's explained
15:22
it in heavenly language
15:24
okay we usually do a couple of kids once
15:26
this one there's a one by a child and
15:27
one by a young man so here's the my
15:30
grandson i don't know his age deborah
15:31
says my grandson wants to know
15:34
if dinosaur dinosaurs have feathers
15:37
and are there bright colors in heaven so
15:39
that's his son i don't have the
15:41
grandson's name
15:42
well i can start with the colors there's
15:44
colors in heaven that don't exist on the
15:46
earth
15:47
everything we have here is a shadow of
15:50
what is in heaven
15:52
and i always like every time i say that
15:53
the holy spirit makes me say this on
15:55
purpose that heaven is a world that's
15:57
round
15:58
like the earth is round
16:00
and he is adamant about saying it's not
16:02
flat and i know some people don't
16:03
understand that there's a whole group
16:05
out there the flat earth society
16:08
uh they think they can figure that out
16:10
and i went well they're not god and they
16:12
didn't make it and i happen to know that
16:14
it says that he sits above the circle of
16:16
the earth and i guess they think that's
16:17
a flat circle i don't know the holy
16:20
spirit always wants me to bring that up
16:22
because there's people who are in that
16:23
and really believe it and uh but i'm
16:26
telling you the earth is round it is a
16:28
world uh the father's house is a world
16:32
it's not just a building
16:34
and so whatever he makes or comes from
16:36
his being one of the things that comes
16:38
from his being is the rainbow and i tell
16:41
people if you want to see what it looks
16:42
like go watch the northern lights or
16:44
find it online the northern lights it's
16:46
not just a stagnant rainbow in other
16:49
words it doesn't just sit on him like
16:50
this it moves in and out in waves the
16:54
different uh layers of that rainbow and
16:56
anything it touches will turn that color
16:59
and so let me tell you everything you
17:01
would never expect trees can be teal
17:03
color uh they can be pink they could be
17:05
gold
17:07
creatures they're different colors so
17:09
yes there are vivid very beautiful
17:12
colors in heaven all over heaven there
17:15
are some dinosaurs that have wings and
17:17
some of them have feathers in them some
17:19
aren't some are made out of whatever
17:21
whatever substance he made them out of
17:23
but they're totally his dinosaurs he
17:25
made them i want to add again the holy
17:27
spirit says please tell them they didn't
17:28
come from hell there's this thing called
17:30
reptilian seed i don't know where that
17:32
came from i've never heard god say it he
17:34
made the dinosaurs he put him on the
17:36
earth the first time he made it
17:39
wow oh good good good okay now this is a
17:41
young man his name is elijah and people
17:43
have different questions that i wouldn't
17:45
have this question hopefully i'm going
17:46
to turn to it and the question is
17:49
do people blink in heaven now that
17:51
wouldn't be mine but he wants to know if
17:52
people blink
17:54
i'm pretty sure they do blink you still
17:56
have your eyelids in heaven your
17:58
spiritual body looks like you except
18:01
better better meaning if you were older
18:03
you're going to look young there's is
18:06
filled with the life of god you do kind
18:07
of glow a little bit uh people do kind
18:10
of glow in their spiritual body but you
18:12
can clearly see that's who that person
18:14
is you recognize him it says in heaven
18:16
you'll be known as you were known
18:17
there's a scripture and so it's not like
18:19
you become some little wispy thing
18:22
you're living in a spiritual world that
18:25
has substances it's almost like being
18:27
here but better
18:28
okay no darkness there of any kind but
18:31
you have a life you have a mansion you
18:32
live in the mansion you eat food you you
18:35
wear different clothing um so i forgot
18:39
what the question was
18:40
yeah
18:44
oh you will blink you will blink when
18:46
you see some of the things he's put up
18:48
there i mean a lot of people are like
18:49
they're like this
18:52
i mean you still have emotions you don't
18:55
have you know like fear you know or
18:57
anger or stuff like that but you have a
18:59
lot of you get excited and intensely
19:01
excited and undone and overwhelmed
19:04
because of the wonder and the splendor
19:06
which you're not going to ever find out
19:08
what that means to you go there so yes
19:10
people definitely blink
19:12
they blink they laugh i mean they laugh
19:14
a lot in heaven and they get overwhelmed
19:17
and undone by the goodness of god by the
19:19
waves of love that penetrate every bit
19:21
of heaven up there so it's just an
19:24
amazing place to live i will say this
19:27
again what jesus said tell everybody on
19:29
earth you have to make a living in order
19:31
to exist but in heaven you actually
19:34
exist to live to live you know my wife
19:37
and i said this all the time we said
19:39
that when we went to her parents
19:40
memorial they both passed away within a
19:42
week of each other in october
19:44
we both said since we know cat
19:48
and what we've learned about heaven our
19:49
entire
19:52
how to a demeanor at someone's death our
19:55
understanding is so much different
19:57
there's so much less grief there's so
19:59
much joy when our loved ones go go to be
20:02
with the lord because this is a
20:04
beautiful place yes their
20:06
body is here
20:07
they're reading means they're buried we
20:09
buried the dead we bury their remains
20:12
but they're not there they're with the
20:13
lord if they're if they're safe so it's
20:15
an entirely different thing and cat you
20:17
know i've never even thanked you as much
20:19
as i want to thank you for for changing
20:22
are
20:23
just giving us the truth you people
20:24
don't know you've actually paid a price
20:26
to do this so
20:27
we appreciate that we do appreciate that
20:29
very much all right now this is an
20:31
acquaintance of my
20:34
think i'd be better just read it because
20:35
it rather than try and tell it so here
20:37
it goes and this is from oh dear holly
20:41
he goes i had a question
20:43
for you or for cat i was wondering when
20:45
we pray over areas like for me it's
20:48
praying over ohio and indiana against
20:51
tornadoes do we need to be called
20:54
to a certain area or can we pray over
20:56
any area the reason i ask is because i
20:59
felt led to pray over my two states and
21:01
have since i was very young but i
21:02
remember and she names the name of a
21:04
teacher
21:05
a prophetic teacher he said i remember
21:07
years ago this teacher saying
21:09
you're asking for trouble my paraphrase
21:12
she said
21:13
if you pray over territories that you're
21:15
not called to pray over
21:18
which i did after kentucky got hit so
21:20
hard by tornadoes in december
21:22
they stopped at the ohio border i prayed
21:25
for iowa and minnesota when they were
21:27
expecting an outbreak of tornadoes and
21:30
immediately after that i got covered
21:33
so she's wondering did she do that to
21:35
herself because she prayed over a state
21:37
that she didn't have authority over
21:39
that had nothing to do with you
21:42
except you probably terrified the enemy
21:43
by doing it any believer
21:47
has the right to be over the weather i
21:49
will say this
21:51
the area you live in the state that you
21:54
live in you have a greater level of
21:56
authority but you really can take
21:58
authority and i do want to remind you
22:00
the holy spirit again is saying
22:01
something to me said remind them jesus
22:04
was in the storm when he stopped it
22:08
so you have greater authority wherever
22:10
you are present
22:12
so no matter what state you're in if
22:14
you're present when something comes up
22:15
you totally have the right to take
22:17
authority over that system that storm uh
22:20
there's nothing wrong with that jesus
22:22
was definitely over the weather no
22:23
matter where he went and when we were in
22:26
israel i spoke and dispelled the fog
22:28
that they said would be there for 25
22:29
minutes around the boat and i spoke and
22:31
within minutes it was gone i know i have
22:34
authority over it then me would like to
22:35
think you don't and people who've never
22:37
learned this
22:38
or even searched out what it said about
22:40
that you should understand that that
22:44
jesus is an example of what we can do
22:47
that's why he did these miracles it
22:48
wasn't just so he could be known
22:50
it was so that we also could step into
22:53
that place like him walking the
22:55
authority he gave us
22:57
if we have power over all the power of
22:59
the darkness and the enemy the enemy
23:01
causes severe weather that's not a
23:04
natural thing and i know the scientists
23:06
would say it was but what they're not
23:08
right they don't know understand the
23:10
spiritual side of things or the unseen
23:12
realm uh whatever you will take
23:14
authority over and of course you're not
23:16
giving yourself to the darkness i have
23:17
to add that you can't play an enemy's
23:19
camp and sin all the time and think you
23:22
have authority over anything
23:24
you you know there's a reason why jesus
23:26
said to walk a certain way
23:28
and if you walk in the spirit that means
23:30
you're aware of it of what's going on uh
23:32
you know you have authority in it and
23:34
you operate in that authority you can
23:37
you can make an effect on any severe
23:39
weather no matter what it is wherever
23:40
you are personally but other than that
23:43
where you live like floor is my greatest
23:45
level of authority although now he
23:47
actually says i speak worldwide about
23:49
things myself and and that that person i
23:52
think that said you were asking for
23:53
trouble that may have been he may have
23:55
been talking about the demonic hierarchy
23:58
like spirits of wickedness in high
24:00
places over certain areas he maybe they
24:02
meant that uh i know there's a thumb now
24:05
taking authorities over principles and
24:07
powers you better have holy spirit with
24:09
you and listen to the protocol you go
24:11
through to do that but i'm just talking
24:13
about right now about the weather any
24:15
weather system that would be destructive
24:17
you absolutely and you proved that by
24:19
what you did and we have way too many
24:22
testimonies that we we know
24:24
that we have the right to stop storms
24:26
shred storms or even shred them and
24:29
lower them and send them to places like
24:31
that need rain we've been doing that
24:33
this last year
24:35
well you know um that
24:37
that begs this question which you
24:39
actually just addressed is if someone
24:41
let's say it's not the weather and i'm
24:43
thinking of a friend of mine david he's
24:45
with the lord now but he told me years
24:47
and years this is like 30 years ago 30
24:49
40 years ago he was
24:51
in new york and he decided he was going
24:53
to take on the principality over new
24:54
york city and he was a seer he was a
24:57
singer so he saw it
24:59
and he came after this thing and he goes
25:00
i know you know he took a you know
25:02
within a couple minutes the car was
25:04
stopped he was arrested for some
25:06
trumped-up charge and put in jail he
25:08
said i'll never do that again so is that
25:10
what you're talking about he took
25:12
authority where he didn't have authority
25:13
and it was like
25:15
almost arrogant that he could do that
25:16
right if it is you know i was contacted
25:19
by very high level people
25:22
in the intercessory
25:23
arena and asked because you know six
25:27
times he has had me
25:29
through his protocol unseat
25:30
principalities i never once on my own
25:34
would even think to approach them you
25:36
know anything attacking me anything
25:38
coming against me or my family in the
25:40
demonic arena or in the arena i
25:42
absolutely have authority over that but
25:44
principalities and powers are very very
25:46
high level uh demons they don't live in
25:49
hell they sit on thrones over regions
25:51
where there's a lot of darkness and
25:53
there is a protocol to do it but you
25:55
better know what that is and god usually
25:57
will appoint me and tell me to go there
25:59
and what to do about it so i would not
26:02
and these people in high places on the
26:04
earth said how did you do that and not
26:06
die because they know people who died
26:08
they try to do so sometimes it's more
26:10
serious than just you think well i'm
26:12
over all of this and i can be uh you
26:14
know i can tear down the high things
26:16
and uh i wouldn't try to do that if you
26:19
don't have a lot of maturity in you
26:20
you're not hearing what god is saying
26:23
um i think you know depending on what he
26:26
did when he was in new york city he may
26:28
have been arrested just by if he's
26:29
getting out standing and yelling and
26:31
stuff like that as something out in the
26:32
public that may have been the reason why
26:35
that happened but i totally would not go
26:37
against something that god didn't tell
26:39
me to i'm not afraid of it i just am
26:41
wise
26:42
and so yeah people have died from doing
26:45
that and so i do have spirit realm boot
26:47
camp every year twice a year and uh if
26:50
you hear me doing that somewhere you
26:51
should come because then you understand
26:53
the operations of the spirit realm uh
26:55
different levels i don't run around
26:57
naming demons you know i don't just
26:58
don't do that i just take authority
27:00
where i don't where i want authority
27:02
but the special commission to go and do
27:04
something i have to follow exactly what
27:07
he's saying and it does happen but it's
27:10
not like i do that all the time so i
27:12
would definitely tell people don't step
27:14
out on your own power and your own
27:16
understanding of who you are think that
27:19
you can pull down those high places
27:21
there is a protocol but if you don't
27:24
know the protocol i would encourage to
27:25
do it but so that's what i did i
27:28
followed god's protocol
27:30
in 2000 my wife and i went to we were
27:32
offered to speak at a place in nigeria
27:36
and one of the evening
27:38
is there's 15 000 pastors and leaders
27:40
from africa at this place in
27:42
north area
27:44
and they decided to tell the whole
27:46
group that they were going to take on
27:48
and they started talking about the god
27:49
of the moon and blah blah blah and i
27:50
turned to our intercessor uh lisa she
27:53
was also see her i said is this okay for
27:55
us to do and she goes i wouldn't do this
27:57
at all so we just kept our mouth shut
28:00
let them do what they were gonna do i
28:02
didn't feel like they had authority
28:04
i don't think i and i didn't have the
28:05
authority it wasn't false humility it
28:07
was like
28:08
no there's no way i'm gonna
28:10
dance on this i got sick after that trip
28:12
as it was you know and i didn't
28:15
so anyway we got to be you got to
28:16
respect that
28:18
i think it's jude that says even even
28:20
michael the archangel didn't cast a
28:22
railing judgment against satan but said
28:24
the lord rebuked you so even there were
28:26
certain respect of the high level so all
28:29
right yeah so the weather
28:31
clearly
28:32
and i don't teach people how to get
28:33
protocols they don't ask me yeah that's
28:35
god wants you to go put on principality
28:37
he will tell you the protocol on how to
28:39
do that but as far as the there are
28:41
different levels in the darkness just
28:43
like those different levels and there's
28:45
different levels in business different
28:46
levels in the in the christian world uh
28:49
the medical field you wouldn't send
28:51
someone who's an intern to go do open
28:52
heart surgery would you and that's kind
28:55
of what you're doing if you think you
28:56
can go up without any authority remember
28:59
the seven sons of skiva let's just go
29:00
back to the bible and they saw you know
29:02
peter paul casting out demons they
29:04
thought they were going to go try it
29:06
they didn't have any authority
29:07
themselves that hadn't been walking in
29:09
that authority increasing that authority
29:11
and that demon tore them up so
29:13
there you go in the bible
29:16
you have to know what you're doing peter
29:17
and paul weren't attacked they weren't
29:19
assaulted they knew exactly what to do
29:20
and how to do it and they had walked
29:23
in that for some time in their life so
29:26
it's probably a good subject to bring up
29:28
because in these days of course there's
29:30
stuff everywhere you're seeing and
29:32
there's a big difference in trying to
29:33
take authority over a person doing
29:35
something wicked and in the spirit realm
29:37
maybe we'll do another whole session on
29:39
just that that would be important but
29:41
yeah um
29:42
people who are wicked in the natural
29:45
the reason they're like that is there
29:46
are demons around them affecting and
29:48
controlling them we can speak against
29:51
that part of it but i wouldn't uh
29:53
there's nowhere in the bible that i saw
29:55
where it said go attack people in the
29:56
natural
29:58
so even sending the host
30:01
even sending the host if you know
30:03
there's a person over here that's being
30:04
affected by demons and you say i'm
30:06
sending the host to take out the demons
30:08
that are causing him
30:10
that's one thing versus i come against
30:13
the principality that's that's
30:14
empowering those demons don't do that
30:16
right
30:18
well uh i think you can send the host
30:20
anywhere that you're impressed to send
30:22
them
30:23
and if they have authority from god to
30:25
do it then he'll allow them to do it and
30:29
if if he hasn't given them because even
30:31
they have different levels of authority
30:33
the army of heaven i'm talking about
30:35
because if you remember
30:38
you know even gabriel had to send for
30:39
michael for help going back to the
30:41
second thing you were talking about
30:43
he couldn't face these high-level demons
30:47
coming to bring that message to daniel
30:49
he couldn't do it himself he called for
30:50
michael when michael showed up let me
30:52
tell you i promise you they left okay
30:54
michael's not going to come in through
30:56
all your peers people just so you know
30:57
that
30:58
but anyway there are levels in every
31:01
type of army the natural army the
31:03
darkness the light and so um you need to
31:06
understand some of that stuff before you
31:08
try to go into that but sending the host
31:11
if you feel impressed to send them to
31:12
certain places if they have been given
31:14
the right by god to take down those
31:16
things they will
31:18
but the other things that they can do to
31:20
protect you to keep you
31:22
to pull down evil spirits in cities and
31:24
around areas if you have family there or
31:27
friends
31:29
or god has signed us on you to pray for
31:31
a certain area of things are going on
31:33
you definitely can send the army there
31:35
to pull down strongholds uh that's
31:37
different those are still the demonic it
31:39
says that our weapons they are minded to
31:42
the pulling down and strongholds that's
31:44
still the demonic that's still the dark
31:46
army but the the weapons one of those is
31:49
the army of heaven and so there are
31:51
certain things they automatically know
31:53
they can do and take care of um don't
31:55
let that stop you from starting to be
31:58
involved with the commanding the army of
32:00
heaven right now in this time they're
32:02
set but you have to know what you're
32:03
doing okay you still have to know what
32:05
you're doing and even what is the
32:07
purpose of your own heart are you doing
32:10
it yeah and i've heard you talk a lot
32:12
for the very first time i ever heard you
32:14
talk publicly you cautioned and exhorted
32:16
and warned
32:18
and taught people you better not have
32:20
sin in your life if you're doing some of
32:21
these things number one they're not
32:23
going to sit there and fold your hands i
32:24
think i recall you know you tell them
32:34
the word says that um
32:36
the army of heaven the host is the army
32:40
they're always called the host in the
32:42
bible the host hearken unto the word of
32:45
the lord why would they do that because
32:46
he's the lord of hosts jesus is over the
32:50
entire army of heaven no matter where
32:52
they're sent he is involved with that
32:54
they hearken under what he says so if
32:56
you're not talking
32:58
powerfully you're not talking in the
33:00
word in the word pray praying if you
33:03
don't have a strong relationship with
33:05
jesus christ hearing him clearly about
33:08
things some things like if you want to
33:10
send the army to go attack someone down
33:12
the street you don't like them you don't
33:13
like that they're loud noisy or crazy or
33:15
whatever
33:16
that army number one's never going to
33:18
attack humans
33:20
so that's why you have to speak as if
33:22
the lord would be saying it then they
33:24
will do what you're saying it is it is
33:27
also there's requirements to do have
33:29
authority and operate in it or we'd have
33:31
just chaos everywhere against everything
33:34
even heaven does have an order and
33:36
protocol is the best way to say that
33:38
their army operates by protocol like the
33:40
earth's army can't take orders from just
33:43
anybody you know the military can't they
33:45
have to take from those who have the
33:46
authority to give the orders and those
33:49
people have to operate even in the
33:50
military in a certain way to be able to
33:53
to head up our military uh some
33:56
private's not gonna run out there and
33:58
start yelling at the generals on people
33:59
to give orders in the in the natural
34:01
army well the same thing happens in the
34:04
spiritual army so you definitely need to
34:06
have a greater understanding of what you
34:08
think you're going to take down all of
34:10
hell
34:12
along the lines of the host you've
34:14
taught and shown pictures and all of
34:16
that about hosts that impress themselves
34:18
in cloud formation so that you can see
34:20
that they're there okay so
34:23
if someone's watching this today and
34:25
they've never heard that i just wanted
34:26
to say that part but this person says
34:28
every time i look into the sky i see or
34:31
seem to see a dragon in the clouds are
34:33
there hosts that look like dragons
34:37
yes there are they're called aragons
34:40
loki wow
34:41
and they they ride the host sometimes
34:45
we'll ride them let me get a drink i'm
34:46
talking a lot
34:51
um the hosts are transported to the
34:53
earth to do battle in many different
34:55
forms
34:56
one of the ways they love to do is they
34:59
ride the air guns the air guns are
35:00
actually part of the host they're not
35:03
just a ride they actually wore
35:05
themselves against some of the other
35:06
demonic part of the army but i actually
35:09
have a picture of some of them writing
35:11
i'm going to be posting some new
35:12
pictures or
35:14
maybe do a i don't know a host id
35:16
workshop somehow uh online and let
35:19
people know um but i actually have
35:22
pictures real pictures not doctored up
35:24
pictures you're talking to someone who's
35:26
clueless about
35:27
anything on the web or even doing stuff
35:29
or art i am a photographer old school
35:31
taking pictures you know with my film
35:33
camera and stuff like that
35:35
i can't i couldn't in any way nor do i
35:38
have time to learn how to fix things or
35:40
change things
35:41
uh the pictures i take are legit the
35:44
real god sends them i take the pictures
35:46
and he allows me to show them
35:48
but there are some called eragons and i
35:49
have a powerful one i think it was in
35:52
the calendar we did on the host
35:54
coming in and i was actually in the
35:56
store this big um
35:58
parking lot where there's like i don't
36:00
know on office max and michael's and
36:02
other things and it's a great big open
36:05
area so it's a good year to go and see
36:07
what's coming and usually they'll follow
36:08
me or come because i'm there
36:10
but i got the best picture ever of this
36:13
one aragon and you would call him a
36:15
dragon uh and dragons thing about
36:17
dragons that i do know is there is one
36:21
who's one of the gods in like these um
36:24
asian countries
36:26
and they have five toes i'm getting real
36:29
specific okay
36:30
uh none of heaven's aragon's and for
36:33
whatever reason they have four toes not
36:36
five
36:38
it is very interesting it was something
36:40
the holy spirit showed me and i went and
36:41
looked and i checked out and it's
36:43
absolutely true
36:44
some of these dragons that they show and
36:46
you know i do also want to go back to
36:48
the word that that god called satan the
36:51
old dragon
36:53
and there's a reason why he called him
36:55
an old dragon an old dragon would be
36:57
toothless they'd have no fire left in
37:00
them they'd have no power left in them
37:02
at all if you think about why he called
37:04
him that
37:05
god has a behemoth which is an aragon he
37:08
has one himself
37:09
and uh but they're not bad in any way
37:12
are they bad uh so that's just uh not
37:15
that you should bring well i will go
37:17
into another time but you shouldn't
37:18
bring certain things in and just hang
37:20
pictures of stuff on your walls i
37:22
definitely wouldn't hang anything that
37:23
was a
37:24
attached to witchcraft in any way you
37:27
don't want to bring that into your home
37:29
just don't do it
37:31
derek prince found that out himself and
37:33
one of his stories he told but but the
37:36
five-toed dragon is worshiped in other
37:38
asian countries as a god uh but all of
37:42
the aragons that fight in heaven or come
37:44
from heaven have four toads and their
37:48
whole purpose is to work with the army
37:50
of heaven so yes there are some you
37:52
actually can write on them in heaven
37:54
when you when you go there but they're
37:56
called eragons that's true wow that's
37:58
good and someone else i don't remember
38:00
if i ask you this but a different
38:02
question at a different time wanted to
38:04
know if satan or if the enemies of our
38:07
soul
38:08
can he press things into the cloud too
38:10
would someone look at that and say well
38:11
that looks like demonic
38:13
or or does he have not not the power to
38:15
do anything with that what would you say
38:17
oh no they you know i i would just tell
38:20
people the spirit realm all around us
38:23
is unseen there's more of the spirit
38:25
round than the physical realm you need
38:26
to understand that the physical realm
38:29
was stretched out like a curtain before
38:32
god even put these physical uh planets
38:34
and stars before he put them there he
38:36
actually had to make a physical realm
38:39
it talks about in the bible where he
38:41
says uh you know he stretched it out
38:43
like a curtain that's actually what he
38:45
did before he made the earth and
38:47
everything uh he spoke the word and the
38:50
word actually stretched the curtain out
38:53
and that's why it says at the very end
38:56
of the bible he will fold this all up
38:58
like an old garment which i think is
39:00
pretty cool yeah so further on in the
39:03
early in the bible it says you stretch
39:04
the stars and plants out like a curtain
39:06
and but at the very end it says he will
39:08
fold it all away like a garment hey
39:10
there's that curtain he's folding it
39:11
away and going to make all things new so
39:14
that's just to let you understand in
39:16
order to have this physical plan and you
39:18
live here in the physical body you had
39:20
to make a physical realm the spirit
39:22
realm always existed it's a real realm
39:25
everything in it has substance it's all
39:27
spiritual it's all spiritually
39:29
um
39:31
living but that's why in your spiritual
39:34
body you literally live a real life in
39:36
heaven if you base down here you have
39:38
the best bakery in heaven uh if you run
39:41
rodeos you have rodeos in heaven but the
39:43
the bulls and the horses are talking to
39:44
you the whole time you're trying to ride
39:45
them and you're not ever going to win
39:47
probably up there
39:49
but but there's a difference your spirit
39:51
is unseen right now but in heaven is
39:53
seen everywhere this what you've
39:56
to clarify that can a spirit can an evil
39:58
spirit do something with the clouds that
40:00
someone would identify yes okay and i do
40:03
have i this is kind of tight
40:06
i do have some pictures of them in the
40:08
clouds i'm not showing this yet because
40:10
yeah but they are and sometimes like
40:13
like in you might think if they haven't
40:15
been photoshopped in some severe weather
40:18
you might actually see some faces off
40:21
the darkness okay and some of those in
40:23
those situations
40:25
but there are more of the hosts on the
40:28
earth than there are the demonic but yes
40:30
they can also but they don't do a good
40:32
job of it i'm just going to say there's
40:34
a big difference in how they try to make
40:36
a shape because some of the hosts can
40:38
get together and make some kind of
40:39
really fantastic shape in the clouds
40:42
um but the demonic when they try to do
40:44
it they don't want to they don't work
40:46
together they just don't work together
40:48
they don't like each other they don't
40:50
i'm talking about the dark army the
40:51
eamon the demons
40:53
they don't like each other they don't
40:54
care about each other they don't want to
40:56
work together at all and so what they
40:58
try to do together usually doesn't turn
41:01
out really good
41:03
and i want to clarify that one thing
41:05
that you said because i'll make sure
41:06
people know what you're referring to
41:08
maybe you need to give an example but
41:10
you said derek prince learned the hard
41:11
way put something on his wall what are
41:13
you referring to that someone put on a
41:14
wall that someone should be because we
41:16
were talking about clouds and all of a
41:18
sudden you were saying this i want to be
41:19
sure people know what you're referring
41:21
to about don't put them yeah back when
41:22
we were talking about the dragon thing
41:24
okay
41:25
yeah he and this is a story he told
41:28
himself of course we all know he's in
41:29
heaven right now uh he did get them i
41:31
think he inherited them from his
41:33
grandfather or something when he he
41:36
served i think in one of the wars in an
41:38
asian country and brought back pictures
41:40
of these um
41:41
i think they were the five-toed dragons
41:43
okay okay that's what he put on the wall
41:46
yeah and he didn't he was clueless and
41:48
you know derek prince was one of the
41:49
first ones to talk about piercing the
41:51
darkness he actually he began to uh to
41:53
look at that listen to god and god
41:55
taught him a lot about the darkness and
41:57
the spirit realm and the darkness and
41:59
yet it changed everything when he put
42:00
him on his walls he didn't say to god
42:03
are these are these acceptable he just
42:05
put him on his walls even
42:08
i think his wife got real sick his
42:09
friends began to hate him his business
42:11
was falling apart and finally and every
42:14
time he walked by him he would admire
42:16
them i just tell you what he said
42:17
himself he would admire them aren't they
42:19
beautiful oh i love them you know i mean
42:21
he was actually
42:23
and finally he went to god and said why
42:25
is my wife so sick why have my friends
42:28
all left me and god said you have a
42:30
defilement and you've put on your walls
42:31
you need to take them off
42:35
he said what he said the dragons
42:39
you know mine
42:40
walked he cleansed his house he cleansed
42:42
it and immediately listen his wife was
42:46
healed
42:48
back his his business and his money
42:50
exploded
42:52
because he had obeyed god and after that
42:54
he that's when he began to teach people
42:57
be careful what you bring into your home
42:59
if it's statues of other gods they
43:01
wouldn't bring it you know what god said
43:03
about that himself you know he said to
43:05
break them up and not even have nothing
43:06
to do with them it isn't this is a thing
43:08
it isn't like
43:10
a statue of so-and-so
43:12
you know not real god
43:14
that thing itself wouldn't hurt you but
43:16
the spirit attached to it
43:19
and all these um
43:20
things that are going on out there no
43:22
matter what demonic
43:24
influence it is it's not i'm not going
43:26
to name certain religions right now
43:28
because people will be focusing on them
43:30
and some people are very nice and some
43:32
of them not everybody is against people
43:34
a lot of these people in false religions
43:37
are actually kind they don't understand
43:38
why people hate each other but the point
43:40
is this your life is run by the devil
43:42
the devil is over every antichrist
43:45
spirit and the antichrist spirit means
43:47
they're against jesus
43:49
as god and so he introduces all these
43:52
false gods some countries have hundreds
43:54
of them and they they worship them they
43:56
bring food to them they make temples for
43:58
them and that is not helping their life
44:01
in any way whatsoever because they have
44:03
no power to save no power to heal
44:06
and that's god's point you want to bring
44:08
something in and here you are honoring
44:10
something that is an image that is
44:13
worshipped as a false god you know
44:16
not to keep them in your house my
44:18
grandparents were missionaries in china
44:20
my father was born in china i remember
44:23
used to see this massive ornate wooden
44:26
carved hand-carved chest and it was out
44:29
in the living room when we go to our
44:30
grandparents now they were devout
44:31
christian people
44:33
but a whole lot of evil got into my
44:35
family and now
44:36
years later i'm kind of they're all
44:38
going to be with the lord but
44:39
there was a lot of evil stuff that
44:41
entered in as you know i've adjusted to
44:43
with my about my father it makes me
44:45
wonder did them sitting here displaying
44:47
these ornate things with these
44:49
tibetan
44:51
gods or these idols and these things and
44:54
i would go to their house and they're
44:55
all these chinese
44:58
things hanging on the wall some of them
45:00
were probably
45:01
fine but others were these little ornate
45:03
gods and then one of and my
45:05
grandfather's brother gave us that gift
45:07
and i mentioned it before these ivory
45:08
little gods
45:10
from india because they're all the
45:11
missionaries went over there and got all
45:12
these goods so they could show people
45:14
isn't this beautiful it's crazy well we
45:17
could could talk ourselves into thinking
45:19
that's just pretty and that's nice
45:22
some of them you're right some of them
45:23
are harmless some of them are beautiful
45:26
uh people and some of these foreign
45:28
countries have such amazing gifts to
45:30
create
45:32
they don't know god for who he is
45:34
i'm sure if they did they would be
45:36
putting images and some who got born
45:38
again i do know have have done the same
45:41
type of thing but they put the image of
45:43
christ they put the angelic or whatever
45:45
of that on there but the thing is if you
45:47
don't have discernment if you're not a
45:50
seer and you can't see what's around it
45:52
i'd be very careful
45:54
about what you pick up i'm not saying i
45:56
don't like people thinking you have to
45:58
look at every single inch in your place
46:00
or every single thing you have but i
46:02
would say if you know it to be something
46:04
that you know is not a true god
46:07
why have that there instead of something
46:09
that represents heaven or god which is
46:10
one of the reasons by the way by god is
46:13
about to flood the marketplace with all
46:15
kinds of things that represent heaven
46:17
that represent them so people have a
46:19
choice because i understand right now in
46:21
our marketplace especially the one right
46:22
now there's not a whole lot of choice to
46:24
bring light or life or hope even hope
46:27
into people's lives but it does matter
46:30
what what you do portray it matters the
46:33
images you wear it matters the images
46:35
you have put on your skin
46:37
uh i'm just saying god marks people
46:40
himself sometimes but what image are you
46:42
betraying is it's for the kingdom of
46:44
darkness or not sometimes people need to
46:46
break off any connection with what
46:49
they've had put tattooed on them and say
46:51
i break any sever any connection with
46:52
that i know people who were affected by
46:55
that so
46:57
image people used to say image is
46:59
nothing but actually according to god
47:00
image is everything
47:01
it is everything okay well what you
47:03
represent or what you believe sometimes
47:05
or people will think that so we went a
47:08
long way on that whole thing yeah that
47:09
was good that'll give people some tools
47:11
to deal with now this is a i was talking
47:13
to my staff
47:14
beforehand this is a fascinating
47:16
question i would have not thought this
47:18
question would ever be asked but listen
47:21
i think it's really interesting she goes
47:22
i love to knit and crochet she was
47:25
excuse what is it going to be like in
47:27
heaven for a knitter or a crocheter i
47:30
believe that i will have a mansion for
47:32
my knitting
47:34
interesting what are your thoughts i
47:36
agree if that is a gift that she has and
47:38
she loves it and she's really excellent
47:40
at it i think she probably will have a
47:42
studio what what he does he gives
47:44
everybody gets a mansion but part of
47:46
that property or even part of that
47:49
mansion definitely would be you know i
47:52
know you've heard me say people have
47:53
restaurants in heaven they have studios
47:56
they have galleries
47:58
a lot probably number one what she would
48:00
be knitting would be alive the threads
48:02
she would knit together could make
48:04
different tunes and become a symphony
48:06
when she's done with what she makes
48:08
it could also portray something that
48:09
would represent images of things that
48:12
are already in heaven but i do know
48:14
paintings when you paint in heaven they
48:16
come alive i mean they're on your wall
48:18
but you can see movement you can see
48:19
life in them i am quite sure that what
48:22
she would make or knit would have a life
48:24
in itself
48:26
wow very very cool
48:28
um okay this is an interesting uh
48:30
question a viewer asked one of the nine
48:32
gifts of the spirit would the seer gift
48:35
fall under
48:39
i don't know if it has to fall under one
48:40
of those yeah i kind of thought you'd
48:43
say that but i didn't
48:44
god gives that gift god and only god and
48:48
people go well you know there's mediums
48:50
out there and other people who can see
48:53
those people were given a gift by god
48:55
but because the other person got
48:56
overtaken or used by
49:00
the darkness then that gift could be
49:02
used for that purpose
49:04
god makes seers and sinceres it's
49:06
important and you can see why all the
49:07
stuff that everyone has benefited from
49:09
that god has shown me or that i see and
49:11
understand it's important to have seers
49:14
but that gift is only given by the
49:17
father and he puts it in you before he
49:19
sends you
49:21
it's in you and there are different
49:23
levels of seeing sometimes you'll see
49:24
something every now and then sometimes
49:26
you'll see parts of things or not
49:28
sometimes you'll see the darkness
49:29
sometimes the
49:30
the uh or heaven stuff i see everything
49:33
all the time like the whole entire uh
49:36
unseen world that's why you're called a
49:38
seer a seer sees the unseen world
49:42
and um you see transportation you see
49:44
beings going back and forth you see how
49:46
they operate
49:47
which has always been powerful for me
49:49
growing up i was powerful
49:52
not powerful like i came against things
49:54
not that kind of power but the powerful
49:56
knowing who i am and i know the truth
49:59
already because i've seen the truth you
50:01
can't hide the truth from a seer
50:04
so being used on the other side in the
50:07
camp of the enemy and people think i'm
50:09
doing this beautiful stuff for him but
50:11
they they connect with spirit guides and
50:14
stuff like that god doesn't have spirit
50:15
guides people
50:17
he has the angelic and mess mattresses
50:19
for him he has holy spirit so even that
50:22
is
50:23
such a small
50:24
area in the life of almost most
50:26
christians don't know
50:28
um they think when you say the word
50:30
spirit you're being filled with the holy
50:31
spirit which are
50:33
very major to be filled with the holy
50:34
spirit or the holy spirit himself i'm
50:36
talking about the unseen realm when i
50:38
say the spirit and the seer sees it
50:42
you see it clearly some see maybe not so
50:46
clearly but someone who's been doing a
50:48
long time and understood that and then
50:49
trained by god
50:51
what to do with that stuff it's very
50:53
powerful
50:54
i don't think a seer has to come under
50:56
those any of those yeah
50:58
yeah there's i think there's a
51:00
fault the false isn't the right word
51:01
there's an incorrect
51:03
understanding that any gift must fall in
51:05
those nine that gives
51:07
thousands of gifts right yeah and things
51:09
that people can do in variations of the
51:11
things so
51:12
yeah because
51:15
people are sent as a gift themself you
51:17
know what they can do what he has given
51:20
them to do or make or
51:23
use for god's purposes
51:25
we are we are sent every good and
51:27
perfect gift comes down from the father
51:30
of lights those lights are you when you
51:32
lived in him and before he sends you to
51:35
this earth he puts a gift in you and
51:37
having you use that gift all over having
51:40
to do things so
51:41
those are uh i think you're talking
51:43
about
51:44
spiritual gifts i think there's nine
51:46
gifts in the spirit spiritual gifts
51:49
but we all in the natural age have a
51:51
gift also but those nine gifts of the
51:54
spirit are different than god making you
51:56
a certain way and this is what he made
51:59
you he made me a seer it's not i saw
52:02
before i mean you know i got saved four
52:05
years old but i still saw in the spirit
52:07
before that i was a seer because he sent
52:10
me that way so i was two and three i'd
52:12
see angels everywhere but at four i gave
52:14
myself to christ i saw him step inside
52:16
of me
52:17
and i knew he was in there and people
52:19
couldn't couldn't get me away from him
52:21
because i saw him step in me so
52:24
well you know the paul talks about
52:26
that's not one of the nine groups of
52:27
spirit that's just something god makes
52:29
you as a senior
52:31
paul talks about uh you know he prays
52:33
that god will give you a spirit of
52:34
wisdom and revelation that you may know
52:35
him better but this
52:37
when whoever gets the spirit of
52:38
revelation
52:39
there's about a zillion ways you can
52:41
revelate or receive you might have a
52:44
vision you might have dreams you might
52:45
suddenly know and you don't know why you
52:47
know right so two ten people with the
52:49
spirit of revelation
52:51
they may not look alike at all as far as
52:53
how they get it
52:54
that's right
52:57
right
52:58
yeah revelation is
53:00
revelation is god speaking all
53:03
revelation comes from the father it does
53:07
uh of course his son was filled with
53:10
revelation but revelation is the mind
53:12
and heart of god himself of the father
53:15
and when he shares it so you openly
53:17
understand the scriptures you understand
53:20
his plans his will his way uh that's
53:23
what revelation is so powerful
53:26
it's not head knowledge it's usually
53:28
something you didn't think of but it's
53:30
so great
53:31
and it's usually simple it it gives you
53:34
something greater um
53:36
to understand the word of god like i
53:38
said but revelation comes from god most
53:41
of the stuff i'm talking about there's
53:42
no way in my mind i could have thought
53:45
about it or even tried to figure it out
53:47
so revelation definitely comes from god
53:50
and there's many people who get
53:51
revelation yeah hey you know that that
53:54
causes a question that wasn't on my list
53:56
because it happened to me this morning i
53:57
woke up in the middle of the night in
53:59
the middle of the night there's a praise
54:01
song it's like i'm praising but it's an
54:03
old
54:04
old praise song i wouldn't have thought
54:06
about i wouldn't have known and all of a
54:09
sudden the words the music i'm hearing
54:10
it in my mind
54:12
and then this then i went back to sleep
54:14
because i started to praise him and i
54:15
fell back to sleep i wake up a totally
54:17
different praise song is going through
54:19
my mind also when i hadn't thought of
54:21
for months and months so what is that is
54:24
that god asking telling my
54:26
is that god causing praise to rise
54:28
through my spirit while i'm asleep or is
54:31
that god telling me i need to be
54:32
praising how would you discern that i
54:35
think that's
54:36
him filling your spirit with it while
54:38
you're sleeping
54:40
uh people who really seek god even while
54:42
you're sleeping he can impart things
54:44
into you
54:45
and if you happen to wake up in the
54:47
middle of some of that something like
54:49
what you just explained
54:51
some people would get up and just start
54:53
worshiping it's always it's always
54:55
important to worship you know i
54:58
i worship in many different ways with
55:00
god i don't have a voice that i could go
55:02
sing on a platform people would probably
55:03
laugh at me and i wouldn't do that to
55:05
you anyway but on my own of course i do
55:08
jen's laughing behind them
55:11
right now
55:14
just as a funny note just to be funny
55:16
when i was first speaking and i didn't
55:18
really have a clue you know how to do it
55:20
and do any of that the revelation was in
55:23
me but i didn't really know so we went
55:24
to somebody's we used to do a lot of
55:26
home meetings don't ask me to do
55:30
you couldn't get the people in your home
55:31
they'd be all over your yard but they
55:33
were hooking me up for a mic and it was
55:35
right before worship was supposed to
55:36
start
55:37
and jen looks at them and she goes she's
55:39
not leading worship right
55:42
now
55:43
yeah i'm not leading worship right now
55:45
no no no we wouldn't do that
55:53
so we're both like warning them no we
55:55
don't know no she doesn't do that you
55:57
couldn't you could have just made a
55:58
joyful sound you know but some people's
56:00
joyful sound is better than other
56:02
people's joyful sounds but sometimes
56:04
sometimes steve when you wake up first
56:06
thing i will just say this and this is
56:08
truth when you first wake up those first
56:11
few minutes are so key to you probably
56:13
hearing god very clearly i would wake up
56:16
and say do you have something to say to
56:18
me and i'd be talking to god this is
56:20
something you want to say to me
56:22
many times i wake up and the minute my
56:23
eyes open he starts speaking to me and i
56:26
have found it's true when you're between
56:28
that window of the natural
56:31
realm and the spiritual realm
56:34
sometimes he can actually show and tell
56:36
you things if you would wait a few
56:38
minutes and ask him he probably wouldn't
56:41
start to get
56:43
have like visions or have encounters so
56:46
i've never really told people that but
56:48
when i first wake up which is my few
56:51
hours
56:52
he's already even starting to speak to
56:54
me that's when he walks through the wall
56:56
of my home sometimes he'll just start
56:58
sharing things with me i haven't
57:00
connected fully with this natural in
57:03
other words i haven't left my room i
57:04
haven't gone out into civilization yet
57:07
it's really one of the best times to
57:10
begin to listen and see if he's saying
57:12
something and you're so open already
57:14
that when you when you wake steve you're
57:16
already hearing what's going on around
57:18
you that could even be some activity of
57:21
heaven around you happening and that's
57:23
why you're hearing
57:24
some of that music so it could also mean
57:26
that that's really good good good
57:28
teaching good to know because you know
57:30
all i could think of is god must want me
57:32
to worship and so i began but next thing
57:35
i know i'm about i'm asleep again but if
57:37
if i were more intentional and say don't
57:40
let yourself go to sleep
57:42
praise him on purpose and don't go to
57:43
sleep that probably would have been a
57:45
good deal or you could just say steve
57:48
do you want to share something with me
57:50
right in the middle of it say father is
57:52
that you wanting to share something with
57:54
me you might be surprised
57:56
that's good okay that's good good i'll
57:59
do that so
58:00
let me just see i'm cutting notes here
58:02
make sure all right
58:03
let's see
58:05
here's the interesting almost funny
58:06
question is there gravity in heaven
58:11
oh well um there is a form of type of
58:14
gravity i don't think they don't call it
58:15
gravity if you if you jump and you want
58:18
to go down your purposes go down you're
58:19
going to go down okay
58:21
uh you in people i have learned by this
58:24
time that a lot of people do fly all
58:25
over heaven you just can you know when i
58:27
first started going in the beginning
58:29
there's been so much more he's shown me
58:31
i'm so busy sharing what he showed me in
58:33
the beginning and things that people
58:35
really should know about i don't always
58:37
get to add stuff but many people most
58:40
people whenever they when they've been
58:42
there for a while they realize they can
58:44
just like fly around heaven and stuff
58:46
like that if you want to leap on high
58:48
things you also can do that there's
58:50
buildings floating in the air i know
58:51
i've said that you just leap from where
58:53
you're at and you leap maybe 20 30 feet
58:55
above the
58:58
streets or wherever and you can actually
58:59
go into the building that way and when
59:01
you come out you just jump it's not like
59:03
you're going to fault the speed of light
59:04
and smash yourself
59:06
but you will go down that's your purpose
59:08
to go down and you'll go down so it it's
59:10
it's a different life completely well
59:12
yeah you know when i picture heaven i'm
59:15
thinking this beautiful scene this
59:16
building this something but
59:20
in when you're in heaven are you seeing
59:21
activity in the air all the time are you
59:24
seeing it all the time
59:27
oh yeah you're seeing stuff going on all
59:29
the time in the in the i call it the um
59:33
i call it the celestial round would be
59:35
all the sky of heaven the celestial
59:36
realm wrapped around the world god
59:38
heaven
59:39
there's almost as much activity up there
59:41
there's buildings there's streets to go
59:43
on in in the sky there's shops to go
59:46
into oh there's all kinds of things to
59:48
do you can imagine you're not bound just
59:50
to be walking on the ground
59:53
uh you travel on light you travel on
59:55
sound you travel on music it's just
59:57
almost inconceivable try to take i can't
60:00
wait till we start making movies we are
60:02
going to make movies god's already
60:03
informed me of that and you will
60:05
actually see life in heaven lived in in
60:08
movies but they haven't liked this one
60:11
he said they exist to live they didn't
60:13
live until they got that
60:15
yeah
60:16
anything i'm not going to argue with
60:18
people i have to always say that you'll
60:20
know your body sleeps in the ground your
60:21
body does but you aren't your body your
60:24
body's wrapped around your spirit man
60:27
you were always a spiritual little being
60:29
a little one and then when you came to
60:31
earth and he gave you this body this
60:33
body adapted to the appearance kind of
60:35
of your spirit man you become like one
60:38
then of course when you die your spirit
60:40
goes to heaven your soul is in your
60:42
spirit your soul is not sleeping okay
60:46
that's not right your soul is never
60:47
going to sleep it never sleeps your
60:48
soul's awake even while you're sleeping
60:50
now that's why you should play awesome
60:52
music and feed your spirit or somebody
60:55
words of god speaking or something
60:57
or i'm just tell people feed your spirit
60:59
at night by listening to something
61:00
that's powerful or beautiful that would
61:03
that would um
61:04
open up you know more of your spirit to
61:07
hear but but no there's so much activity
61:10
in the sky of heaven i think half of
61:12
half of heaven is in the sky the other
61:14
half the beautiful ground of heaven so
61:18
yeah well yeah the stuff in the sky like
61:20
that it makes me think of movies where
61:22
they make
61:23
everything in the air but i know i don't
61:24
normally think of it that way but okay
61:26
this one caleb wants to know has cat
61:29
ever seen michelangelo
61:31
or any other famous painters and artists
61:34
like van gogh and chris you've seen a
61:36
lot of people but there's thousands you
61:38
haven't seen it's not like you've seen
61:39
them all
61:40
have you seen any famous artists like
61:42
that or old time
61:44
they there are there are of course
61:46
there's famous artists who went there
61:48
many of them knew god and were close to
61:50
god themselves
61:51
i can't at this moment i've seen work
61:54
done by some of them but but i can't say
61:56
i literally saw that person and you're
61:58
right there's actually millions of
62:00
people in heaven right now people
62:03
picture heaven with a handful of people
62:05
in health full of the masses but there's
62:07
there's a lot of people that live in
62:09
heaven and heaven is so huge it's bigger
62:12
than our own galaxy the world called
62:14
heaven is bigger than a galaxy
62:16
there's no way okay you've been bent but
62:18
the few places but significant places
62:21
like the throne room and other places
62:23
that are in heaven god wants people to
62:25
know
62:26
uh it's this earth is a shadow it's just
62:29
a shadow of what's there the beauty
62:31
splendor wonder the activity that your
62:33
loved ones are getting to do some of
62:35
them actually ask things to be prepared
62:37
to bless you when you get there there
62:39
are places you know he says i might we
62:42
go to prepare i go to prepare a place
62:44
for you
62:45
that place is not just one mansion i
62:49
will tell you that again on the ground
62:51
or property which could be miles if you
62:54
want miles around your property
62:57
and have beautiful things on that
62:58
property that you love to do or enjoy
63:00
doing there's doors all over the
63:03
property just floating about a foot
63:04
above the ground when you walk in that
63:07
door on your property it takes you to
63:09
another part of your place it could be
63:10
somewhere else in heaven wow wow so your
63:13
place can be
63:15
okay so i've always
63:17
thought well i'd like to have a place in
63:18
the mountain
63:19
in heaven a place on the valley and a
63:22
place
63:23
by the sea whatever because that's what
63:25
i would like here
63:26
but you're saying you don't go out
63:29
through that doorway that portal to go
63:31
to another place
63:33
it's all your place is that what you're
63:35
saying yes you're right it's all in your
63:37
place
63:38
it's in another part of heaven it would
63:40
be in another area of heaven but when
63:42
you go through that door what you're
63:44
seeing is yours
63:46
that's good yeah yeah
63:50
okay uh here's a woman joanie who says
63:53
cat i've been praying for the gift of
63:55
tongues and it hasn't happened yet what
63:57
can i do
63:59
what can you tell her
64:00
i would say you know of course when
64:04
when i was 18 um when i got filled with
64:06
the holy spirit of course by that time i
64:09
had seen i was raised up in um
64:13
a godly home not perfect home been in a
64:15
godly home where god was so real to me i
64:19
mean he was very real
64:21
activity activities of heaven they were
64:23
real
64:24
i knew about hell i mean my dad
64:26
explained all the stuff says he was very
64:28
very close to the father to jesus
64:31
and so it's his mother so we have
64:33
generations of
64:35
being connected to heaven even while
64:37
living on the urn
64:39
and so i i can just to tell people that
64:42
um i already forgot the question
64:45
about about how to get how to speak in
64:47
tongues she hasn't been able to speak in
64:49
tongues
64:50
yeah the holy spirit's greatest delight
64:53
is to indwell you
64:54
i can tell you that he waits with
64:56
anticipation once you're born again to
64:59
invite him i i would just say i actually
65:02
just invited him to indwell me and said
65:04
i invite you to indwell me holy spirit i
65:06
want to know you uh i want to i want to
65:09
feel your presence around me and and to
65:13
you know i don't think i spoke in
65:14
tongues at that very moment i think it
65:16
was probably later on in the day i was
65:18
just thinking about god thinking about
65:20
that i invited the holy spirit
65:22
and opened my mouth and out came just
65:24
two syllables
65:25
and and that was beside myself excited i
65:28
just kept saying those two syllables and
65:30
pretty soon more read and more were
65:31
added sometimes it happens different
65:34
ways some people are instantly filled
65:36
with the holy spirit and your that's
65:38
they call that also your they can call
65:40
that your prayer language it's another
65:42
word for speaking in tongues that the
65:44
devil is terrified of he doesn't want
65:46
anyone to have that power it's power it
65:49
gives you power
65:50
it gives you confidence in who you are
65:53
the holy spirit will help lead you guide
65:55
you he'll never leave you but there's a
65:57
difference and when you're born again he
65:59
comes alongside and it says that in the
66:01
bible when you're born again the holy
66:02
spirit is alongside you and he will help
66:05
you but when you invite him in when you
66:07
invited him to come in he came in
66:10
for whatever reason you didn't speak at
66:13
that time i would encourage you to keep
66:15
pressing in i wouldn't keep asking i
66:18
know back in the day i was taught you
66:20
ask until you get you ask for hours if
66:22
you have to i think it was the holy
66:24
spirit i don't know what i think about
66:25
that if you sincerely invited him to
66:28
come and indwell you uh it empowers you
66:31
uh you you feel different number one you
66:34
feel like the power of god in you life
66:36
god in you you feel increasing in
66:38
presence of him i have no one of my own
66:41
sisters had that experience and i think
66:43
it was
66:44
some sometime
66:46
i think she's had a few syllables here
66:47
and there in tongues but let me tell you
66:49
the power of god and the prophetic began
66:51
to operate in her after she invited him
66:53
to indwell her this this is the truth
66:56
and i know that we we it says the
66:58
evidence of speaking in tongues the
67:00
evidence that's that's the outward
67:02
evidence and sign to people around you
67:04
knowing that you received him
67:06
i don't think that stops you from having
67:08
him inside of you and you may not have
67:10
ever heard any pastor or preacher ever
67:12
say that before but you invite him to
67:15
indwell you he's going to come in if
67:18
you've got christ in your heart he's
67:19
going to come in
67:20
and then i would just say holy spirit
67:22
show yourself to me
67:24
demonstrate yourself to me open up my
67:27
mouth that i can speak you know speak in
67:30
tongues
67:31
and then i would just say just start
67:33
praising him i would just start telling
67:34
people say when i would help people get
67:36
tongues sometimes you lay your hand on
67:38
sometimes if people already have a lot
67:40
of that they can lay hands on you and
67:41
then then you just start speaking in
67:43
tongues so you can't say
67:46
don't say there's only one way to get it
67:48
the one way you have to get it is you
67:50
are born again you've repented of your
67:52
sins jesus christ is in you he's your
67:54
savior and from the moment you decide to
67:57
pursue i want to speak in tongues i want
67:59
that holy language
68:01
and i will say this also when you pray
68:03
in tongues the devil doesn't know what
68:04
you're saying the devil cannot
68:06
understand
68:08
tongues which is why he doesn't want
68:10
anyone to be filled with it it's like
68:12
the perfect prayer language that you
68:14
know when you're praying what god is and
68:16
putting in you to pray it's very
68:18
powerful but i would say if you've
68:21
already asked to start thanking him is a
68:23
better term to say thank you for the
68:25
evidence of speaking in tongues i've
68:27
already received you and you need to say
68:29
that the holy spirit if you've invited
68:31
holy spirit i choose my will to invite
68:33
you to indwell my person
68:35
to to come on the inside of myself that
68:38
i might understand clearly and and have
68:41
more understanding in the presence of
68:42
god and then you start saying to him
68:44
thank you for indwelling me and thank
68:47
you for giving me open and loosen my
68:49
tongue that i can speak in the heavenly
68:51
language i would really encourage you to
68:53
do that that's that's really really good
68:55
all right this is maybe this is the last
68:57
one um we get a number of questions that
69:00
relate to
69:01
night
69:02
or things so it says i know there's no
69:04
nighttime in heaven but is there a place
69:06
where it is dark where you can see neon
69:08
lights or city lights like it is not
69:11
like it is dark sorry like it is night
69:14
because sometimes it looks beautiful
69:15
looking at night lights
69:19
there's not darkness like we have the
69:20
dark of night here it's never that dark
69:24
there are times where i would have to
69:26
say
69:27
uh the light isn't probably as
69:29
terrifically bright but i will also say
69:31
this
69:32
the first time i was taking this
69:33
somewhere in heaven where i saw those
69:35
lights you wished you could see you saw
69:38
them in in daylight what you would call
69:40
a daylight they were so bright wow it
69:43
streamed out of this whole place you saw
69:45
these brilliant lights everywhere coming
69:48
out of this one place whoops where
69:50
people would go i'm always putting my
69:51
stuff back together
69:53
one day i will have an actual studio
69:56
people there you go uh but i saw these
69:58
brilliant lines i went what is that
70:01
place i mean i was i was unknown it was
70:03
so beautiful you saw beautiful images
70:06
coming through it but these rays of
70:07
light it wasn't just oh that's a pretty
70:09
light it was moving in and out of this
70:11
place
70:13
and uh so trust me even in light the
70:16
light around you
70:18
their lights if they're going to put a
70:19
light show on they can totally they do
70:21
fireworks in heaven not the way we do
70:23
but they have fireworks in heaven and
70:25
they see them clearly but there's like
70:26
paler colors that come through the
70:28
different parts of the sky and different
70:30
parts of heaven
70:31
so i'm sure and and if you want to see
70:33
outer space from heaven you have to step
70:35
through this big doorway that's called
70:37
the observatory you're out in space
70:40
you're not just looking at it
70:42
well and that didn't you say out in
70:44
space it's not dark like we see space
70:47
now but it's isn't a color to it
70:50
oh if you're if you're out in space
70:52
around heaven you see the light of every
70:54
star no matter how far away it is the
70:57
lights of the stars the nebulas the the
71:00
all the beauty of the art i call it a
71:02
space art that god made up there you're
71:04
so far uh right now they call it deep
71:06
space or when they they go up in the
71:08
spaceships uh if they're bi planets that
71:11
make light or if they're by moons like
71:13
circling them or something they have
71:15
more light it's different in in the
71:17
celestial realm around heaven you
71:19
literally are stepping out into part of
71:22
space and seeing it for yourself so you
71:25
can do that you don't have to have a
71:27
telescope to see
71:28
but you do step through this doorway
71:30
that's another whole part that you can
71:32
see beautiful stars and nebulas and
71:34
stuff like that is there a color is
71:36
there a color
71:38
there's color there's color everywhere
71:40
out in space really and they even sell
71:42
calendars you might want to go get some
71:44
that show that they have some out right
71:46
now uh in the stores for the 2022 now
71:49
i'm pushing someone else's product you
71:51
can actually probably order just called
71:53
the galaxies it could be called the
71:55
galaxies or something like that
71:56
and it's when the um when they said some
71:59
of the
72:01
sometimes i'm not good on head knowledge
72:02
when i'm talking about revolution
72:05
they send the ships out to seek out
72:07
places and get pictures of them without
72:09
light
72:10
things like that and they've got
72:12
beautiful uh beautiful close-up pictures
72:15
of a lot of they're called nebulas they
72:17
say they're made out of gas but i know
72:19
that you know particles of gas coming
72:21
together and make a perfect eye out in
72:23
space i'm sorry people that just doesn't
72:25
come on its own yeah
72:27
things like you would look in those
72:28
calendars you would see stuff like that
72:31
stepping through the observatory
72:33
it's called the observatory there's no
72:34
telescope you just walk through this
72:36
ancient looking amazing doorway and
72:39
you're out there in in space seeing all
72:41

74:28
teaching spirit force
74:30
is the number one revelation god has
74:32
given me to train the body of christ how
74:35
to be a member of the army of god that
74:38
it talks about in the bible i'm not
74:39
talking about heaven's army you as a
74:41
member of the army of god on the earth
74:44
will learn how to use all of the weapons
74:46
he gave you spiritual weapons
74:48
and our his plan is for us to crush
74:51
darkness that's the enemy the spiritual
74:53
darkness and push it back
74:55
and you have the right to do that as a
74:57
member of the body there's a lot of
74:58
scripture in all this but the training
75:00
is the most important part and you will
75:03
everybody know we've been getting phone
75:05
calls from everywhere people want to
75:06
sign up for it and we'll have more
75:08
information on spirit force but it'll be
75:10
the number one thing i do next year all

01:34
hey welcome to the broadcast and happy
01:37
wednesday
01:38
january 19 2022
01:42
it's nice to be back sorry i've been
01:44
gone since i think the last time you saw
01:46
me was a week ago today when i did
01:50
the broadcast with kat i we had quite a
01:53
lot of stuff happening i was i was
01:55
supposed to be heading out to the clay
01:57
clark event and uh
02:00
i got taken out by one mega back injury
02:04
and so i didn't wasn't able to go and
02:06
then no sooner did we return home
02:08
from the airport with you know we were
02:11
headed toward the airport we had to turn
02:13
around and come back then drain got sick
02:15
with what we think is probably the
02:17
latest variant
02:19
uh that's going around in about two days
02:22
after that i got it so right now even as
02:24
we speak both three and i got up this
02:27
morning and even though we're doing a
02:28
lot better
02:30
we're still feeling that nausea that in
02:32
fact for me it's the first time it just
02:33
showed up same thing that happened to
02:35
her so
02:36
ah this thing holds on but anyways uh
02:39
thank you all for
02:40
honoring kelsey o'malley
02:44
she did a great great job and i'm very
02:46
much appreciated appreciative of her for
02:49
to stepping in for me but
02:51
it's nice to be back it's nice totally
02:54
nice to be back because you know i like
02:56
to be involved and i don't like to just
02:58
sit around but man
03:00
you want to sleep you want to just ah
03:02
anyway appreciate the prayers thank you
03:05
so much um
03:06
for all of you who did pray for me you
03:08
know even on the back injury that i had
03:11
i don't think we publicized this because
03:14
sometimes it's better not to you know i
03:16
had a mentor you all know who bobby
03:19
connor is and he used to teach never let
03:21
the enemies see you sweat
03:23
um and basically
03:26
the whole thing was don't make a big
03:28
deal to the enemy
03:29
how injured you are because then he
03:31
knows he's one so
03:33
so you try not to complain and you don't
03:36
say oh poor me you know
03:38
and uh so
03:40
that kind of translates well this way
03:42
too because if he told if we told
03:43
everybody oh i'm i'm laying flat on my
03:46
back with this big old injury then
03:48
everyone's worried about you so it's
03:50
almost better to just find out we have a
03:52
prayer team that are always keeping us
03:54
covered so we do cover those things in
03:56
prayer very very seriously when they
03:58
happen but we don't always make it a
04:00
general announcement so
04:02
all right well thank you for being
04:06
our loyal viewers and being coming back
04:08
so let's see what do we want to do i
04:10

so
05:05
i think that's about it
05:08
so
05:08
without further ado let's bring cat
05:10
curry here it's about time we got back
05:13
together kat
05:15
yes i i you know what i missed being
05:18
with you miss talking with you but
05:21
your team does a great job just so you
05:23
know that it was really great it was
05:24
really powerful but
05:26
i was praying i didn't know exactly what
05:28
it was but i was definitely declaring
05:30
over you and praying over you which i
05:32
actually do every day you and doreen wow
05:35
thank you something if i feel impressed
05:37
to pray something stronger than i do
05:40
and um
05:41
just because i'd like to take advantage
05:43
of any chance to train people
05:46
when you begin to have any kind of
05:48
strains whether it's your back your leg
05:51
or severe cramps you can you can learn
05:55
or train yourself to release the peace
05:57
of god into that situation and it
05:59
literally will stop that it will stop it
06:03
god told me one time i had actually
06:05
pulled a muscle or something and i kept
06:07
asking him do something he said i'm not
06:08
going to do he said you're going to do
06:10
it and he said you need to learn to
06:12
release what you already carry which is
06:14
the anointing which we all carry
06:15
according to first john 2 27 go look it
06:18
up
06:18
and the anointing brings like a peace
06:21
with it and literally you would lay on
06:23
your hand on yourself like i release i
06:25
impart the peace of god
06:27
and uh and it might work not work the
06:29
first few times but eventually you will
06:31
do that and the cramp or the pain will
06:33
go wow it has to do with muscles and
06:36
tendons or even your bones and i i have
06:39
to do that all the time if i overdo it
06:41
or for whatever reason you know i what
06:44
if for whatever reason if i have any
06:46
pinched anything or strained anything
06:48
that is the number one way i get rid of
06:50
it with the anointing
06:52
wow and you know what kat you told us
06:55
all a couple months ago you talked about
06:57
people that weren't sleeping well which
06:59
has happened to me a lot in my life in
07:01
the last few years
07:02
and you talked about i command the rest
07:04
of god i think is the way i understand
07:06
it and during i've been practicing that
07:09
the first time i thought it didn't
07:10
really get where i wanted it to go but
07:12
when i remember to do it which i usually
07:14
do if i'm having trouble
07:16
yeah and there'll be a little bit of a
07:18
delay the next thing i know i wake up in
07:20
the morning i mean it's like
07:22
it was really really powerful so if you
07:25
have insomnia anyone watching this and
07:28
what you what i would say
07:31
i had to do is i had to engage my faith
07:35
which means i had to believe that what i
07:36
was saying was gonna work or it was just
07:39
words right yeah kind of have to put
07:41
some faith in it
07:42
so it wasn't just words and then i when
07:44
i when i believe that what i say is
07:47
gonna happen i command the rest of god i
07:49
have a great night's sleep cat that was
07:52
that's a phenomenal teaching
07:54
it is and actually
07:56
it's um it's he showed me one time i was
08:00
in the mountains of north carolina he
08:02
showed me one time
08:03
how we create now i'm not talking about
08:05
when i say create people automatically
08:07
think well you know create like people
08:10
and things like that no you know you
08:12
create stuff like you come up with ideas
08:14
to create things whether it's a cake i'm
08:15
always going to say use cake for you
08:17
know don't forget to celebrate and eat
08:18
cake i'm still doing it but smaller
08:20
pieces by the way
08:22
but when you begin to create even in
08:23
heaven you learn to do this so you can
08:26
get a jump start down here on the earth
08:28
and god says the earth and your time on
08:30
earth is actually boot camp for eternity
08:33
and the greater your faith gets the more
08:36
you can get things done but when i said
08:38
your faith and god said you mean your
08:40
soul
08:41
your soul has to be engaged with
08:43
everything you believe or you speak
08:45
about which is why sometimes you don't
08:47
get good things if you're saying nothing
08:49
but negative about yourself guess what
08:50
you're going to think you're going to
08:51
think negative and it will be hard to
08:54
push through that so number one stop
08:56
saying you can't
08:58
or you won't or you don't have you have
09:01
to stop saying those words because of
09:02
course god created with words
09:05
but he taught me he said what you say
09:07
from your mouth has to line up with what
09:10
is in your soul when your soul engages
09:12
with what you're saying and you know
09:14
that is still it is still of course your
09:17
faith your faith comes from there your
09:19
your soul is your mind what you think on
09:21
your will what you decide to do in your
09:23
emotions is what you say or how you say
09:26
it so he said in order to create things
09:29
like
09:30
wholeness in your body still using the
09:32
blood of jesus of course we wouldn't
09:33
have any of this and i want to go back
09:35
to the beginning of him on the cross we
09:38
would have nothing if we didn't have him
09:41
when we create when we command it's
09:43
because of what he did for us because of
09:45
what he gave us the ability and the
09:46
right to do but even in doing this like
09:49
the believing trusting and then you step
09:52
into faith but it's all created in your
09:55
soul which is why it's important god
09:56
said he said to to guard it to guard
09:59
what that is
10:01
don't let the world let man's opinions
10:03
or thoughts of you come in at you
10:06
you say what you say is what you will
10:08
become and we know the word says that so
10:10
when you begin to engage with like i'm
10:12
having creams in my leg and i want this
10:15
to stop and i have the right to tell it
10:17
to stop i do because we were made uh
10:20
perfect in every way we're new creations
10:22
through jesus christ we speak to things
10:25
and they happen that was his whole point
10:27
of doing it when he was on the earth but
10:29
your soul engages in this whole faith
10:31
thing
10:32
if you think on it and you meditate on
10:35
it that's still your mind that's still
10:36
coming from your soul we were always
10:39
taught the soul was not a good thing but
10:40
that was wrong
10:42
a dark soul maybe but not one filled
10:44
with the light of god and the love of
10:45
god
10:46
so when you begin like the rest of the
10:48
lord will use that uh when you begin it
10:50
is still a process like you're being
10:52
trained for anything whether it's to be
10:54
an athletic or trained for business or
10:56
trained even as a baker it's a process
10:59
and the more you do it the better you
11:01
get it the better results you have it is
11:03
the same thing when you're declaring and
11:05
believing for something when you finally
11:07
believe one day and you say i command
11:10
and that's the proper word i command the
11:12
rest of the lord you're not telling god
11:13
what to do you're doing what he said he
11:15
said command you me he was saying you
11:17
say what you want done
11:19
so this all ties back to the word of god
11:21
this is outside the word this is living
11:24
the word of god and you say i command
11:26
the rest of the lord to come upon me and
11:28
you've been believing for sleep praying
11:30
for sleep
11:31
you begin to say i want the rest of the
11:33
lord i need the rest of the lord the
11:34
rest of the lord you come one day you
11:36
say that and you'll be knocked out by
11:38
god
11:40
i mean you will sleep so good all night
11:42
long and every night after that you will
11:46
be able to do that
11:48
you know and then i just said
11:50
son
11:51
i'm just telling you the people that
11:52
that's a real thing and you know it's
11:54
one thing if you hear this teacher or
11:56
that teacher
11:57
say that you know we we have lots and
12:00
lots of teachers and sometimes it's easy
12:02
to you know i don't know if they know
12:04
for sure i don't know if this is just a
12:06
theory of theirs but when kat who's been
12:09
with the father thousands of times yes
12:12
if she says this is what you're supposed
12:14
to do i take it a little more seriously
12:17
maybe i should maybe i should have taken
12:19
well not that i've heard this particular
12:21
teaching before
12:22
but you know cat it works and you know
12:26
i've spent when i i laid bedridden
12:29
people don't know this a lot of people
12:30
don't know this but from about
12:33
oh
12:34
let's see from 12 especially from about
12:37
2010 to 2012 29 i was bedridden and i
12:41
couldn't sleep i laid there night after
12:43
night i was so deprived of sleep if i
12:46
had known this yeah it would have been
12:48
different oh man that would have been so
12:51
great but you know god
12:53
this is why in this time people go well
12:55
why not before this is a special time i
12:58
don't look at the things going on around
13:00
me i don't ignore them i'm innocent of
13:02
evil i'm innocent of darkness you know
13:03
i'm filled with the light of god and
13:05
hope and power i mean hope was wonderful
13:08
but power and operating in is where god
13:10
wants us to be that's we're supposed to
13:12
be dangerous against hell you're
13:14
supposed to be filled with the light and
13:15
love of god always have an answer
13:18
for people
13:19
of truth yes but of the power of god and
13:22
living in the life of god that's what a
13:24
manifested son and daughter is it's not
13:27
some special people who'll send down to
13:29
heaven all of a sudden they'll be here
13:30
on the earth it's us
13:31
it's us it's the body of christ learning
13:33
to operate in the fullness of what he
13:36
always intended and that's why the
13:37
father normally teaches me himself this
13:40
is what you do and say and hello people
13:42
if anybody knows that would be a father
13:45
son or holy spirit and i've been trained
13:47
by all three of them why so you can be
13:50
trained and be empowered
13:52
it's it's excited to be you know you're
13:55
inspired inspiring is nice empowering is
13:58
better okay
14:00
you live above and never beneath
14:03
how can we rule if jesus said you will
14:06
rule with me in this life and in the
14:08
life to come uh your ruling is totally
14:11
different than you know i'm begging and
14:13
it's okay to ask when you don't know but
14:16
but when you begin to declare and decree
14:18
and you begin to say i'm not tolerating
14:21
sickness i'm not having sickness and the
14:23
word actually says when you bless your
14:25
food you mean you must say take sickness
14:28
far from me
14:29
and did you even know that was worse so
14:31
every time you said your blessing thank
14:32
you for the food but then add and take
14:34
sickness far from me wow wow it won't
14:37
have a chance to even come to you but
14:39
again it's a process it's something i
14:42
add all the time in my prayer when i a
14:46
blessing for your food you can add so
14:48
many things in that uh i thank you for
14:50
this food blessed to my body and i ask
14:52
for and receive your wisdom your
14:55
revelation your understanding you keep
14:58
adding because whatsoever you say is
15:00
what you will have
15:02
right whatever within you or you allow
15:04
in you is what you will become that is
15:07
up to you
15:08
okay jesus christ did his part by dying
15:11
but this was a walk in his footsteps he
15:13
was never afraid okay he was never
15:15
afraid of anything he wasn't killed
15:17
honestly he laid down his life he rose
15:20
from the dead he's the king of
15:22
everything everywhere and he wants you
15:24
to be like him so the enemies the world
15:27
the darkness is crushed and pushed back
15:29
that's how things will really begin to
15:32
change
15:33
and that's why he's having me teach
15:35
spirit force which i know that's where
15:36
this button is this is
15:39
and i'll be very soon um next month
15:42
month of march i'll actually start
15:44
teaching that uh in mass to people
15:47
really really good now i want to ask you
15:49
you mentioned something i want to drill
15:50
down on this for a second
15:52
uh when we've been hearing teaching
15:55
through the years and the decades we've
15:57
talked about someday the manifested sons
15:59
of daughters of god
16:01
and and we'd hear this or that statement
16:04
but you said something a minute ago and
16:06
i'm just gonna run this by you
16:08
have you repeat or clarify
16:10
is it possible that
16:12
two believers
16:15
uh
16:16
side by side
16:18
are walking out their life
16:21
and one of them is
16:24
just like a carnal christian and the
16:26
other person's manifested sons and
16:28
daughters of god because they're because
16:31
they're walking it out can can two
16:33
believers
16:35
one being manifested one not
16:39
yes because manifesting well that
16:41
doesn't mean you're not a believer
16:44
right you get born again this is the
16:46
beginning of everything you choose you
16:50
choose how much of god you want your
16:52
life how much time you give him and if
16:55
you are applying
16:56
just the written word of god but it says
16:59
man shall not live by bread alone but by
17:02
every word spoken from the mouth of god
17:05
and of course everything he says is
17:07
based on his word his written word and i
17:11
tell you right now i don't like it when
17:12
people leave parts of the bible out when
17:14
they decide they're going to translate
17:15
it some other way or something you can't
17:17
delete parts of the bible and i don't
17:20
like it when some people decide well i
17:22
don't think i understand that i'm going
17:23
to change this i would be very careful
17:26
if you if you get a bible that leaves
17:27
whole things out that god said would
17:29
happen i don't know that was free free
17:31
commercial from the holy spirit right
17:33
here
17:33
but i can tell you yes uh even in the
17:36
husband and wife or whatever sister
17:38
brother whatever you choose how much of
17:41
god you're gonna run after and let me
17:43
tell you what a manifested son or
17:46
daughter of god this is how the father
17:48
says it
17:49
to manifest
17:51
means to show and prove who and what you
17:55
believe by what you say the choices you
17:57
make and the power of god you operate in
18:00
wow so i
18:03
let me say this even one other way i
18:05
could be having a conversation
18:08
um making this up of course with my
18:10
let's say with my wife and i'm gonna say
18:12
you know i was at the park and i got i
18:14
got into a conversation with this nice
18:16
family member and you know what the wife
18:20
it's like she's one of the manifested
18:22
sons of god
18:24
and i could say that
18:26
and people go what what are you talking
18:28
about and and and the answer would be
18:31
because
18:32
she is manifesting everything that we've
18:35
ever been taught about what a manifested
18:38
sense of the
18:39
god
18:40
sons of god
18:42
yeah using the word sons yeah sons and
18:45
daughters of god
18:46
so that's am i saying that right someone
18:49
can just be
18:50
a manifested and someone next to them
18:52
might not be
18:54
that is true because that person was
18:56
running after god listening to us you're
18:59
applying
19:00
what you're hearing
19:02
when you go to church and sit in a pew
19:04
you know you're not just there to hear
19:06
something you're here to learn something
19:08
you're being trained okay i told you
19:10
this is all boot camp and you become uh
19:14
you the more of god you let in you
19:17
and you hunger after the more like him
19:19
you will begin to operate uh in the word
19:22
of god when god said let us make man in
19:24
our image that's father son and holy
19:26
spirit and after our likeness that's how
19:28
they operate
19:30
so literally he made us not to be him
19:34
he's not saying to him but he wants us
19:36
to operate in authority and dominion
19:38
over the darkness over the evil and if
19:40
you're over here playing around or
19:42
complaining like you know all you have
19:44
is a bad report and i'm not talking
19:46
about what you just said steve but you
19:47
know there are some people that have not
19:49
got one positive thing in their mouth to
19:51
say and if you you're very positive and
19:54
powerful and you help people
19:56
become great in god by believing he
19:58
really is hearing testimonies of
20:01
overcoming in the power of god they
20:03
begin to think differently but if you're
20:05
always only around people who speak doom
20:08
and gloom negative
20:10
you know and they say things like well
20:11
this is never going to change i can't
20:12
stand this there's so much evil
20:14
everywhere well what are you talking
20:16
about are you talking more about the
20:17
evil or more about the power of god to
20:20
demonstrate and manifest is to let
20:22
people know he is alive you walk in that
20:25
authority yourself people know you have
20:27
authority by the way you're talking
20:30
and you demonstrate that by believing it
20:32
and saying it then you even show people
20:35
how to operate like that i would
20:37
definitely say that would be an operated
20:39
son or daughter of god and it says the
20:42
earth is crying out in the word for the
20:45
manifested sons and daughters of god to
20:46
stand up okay the earth itself knows
20:50
that things aren't going right they know
20:51
the evil is trying to invade they want
20:54
us
20:54
we are his sons and daughters that's
20:57
what god calls us right he is our father
20:59
we're sons and daughters but that
21:01
doesn't mean every son or daughter
21:03
manifest and demonstrate who he is by
21:07
the way you live your life it is a
21:09
lifestyle
21:11
what i live is not just something i say
21:13
here it is my life it's how i live and i
21:16
don't change any day and you can tell
21:19
i had someone call last night and say
21:21
you know that their child
21:23
their child was like screaming
21:25
uh that their brain was hurting and to
21:28
pray for them and i know this person
21:30
said he called me that and this is the
21:32
first thing i can tell you this might as
21:33
well teach you right now
21:36
is trying to attack you as a believer
21:38
they have no right but i'm telling you
21:41
if you've learned about the devil he
21:42
does whatever and get away with and i
21:44
was taught this by another prophet um
21:47
uh
21:48
this couple they they did a lot of
21:50
discernment and deliverance and stuff uh
21:53
and they taught me that if you start
21:55
getting sharp pains in your head that is
21:57
a sign that witchcraft is trying to
21:59
affect you
22:01
and i told them after several things i
22:03
went you need to take your hand over
22:05
your child's head and say i sever all
22:08
witchcraft trying to attack my daughter
22:12
and when they did that because they had
22:14
they did have a fever it wasn't ohio and
22:16
instantly
22:17
there was a change
22:19
wow and see they don't think you know
22:22
how to do that this is one of the things
22:23
you're going to learn in um spirit um
22:25
spirit spirit force by the way is the
22:28
way you live and operate that the enemy
22:31
will run from you and actually says
22:33
satan will flee from you if you put
22:34
yourself under the hand of god and
22:36
resist him resist him isn't just saying
22:39
oh don't call me here it's like i'm
22:40
coming after you
22:42
i'm living the way god said i know who i
22:45
am who he is and i'm not tolerating you
22:47
attacking me
22:49
your life will begin to change
22:51
but like witchcraft will try to sneak in
22:53
it tries to control whatever it can get
22:55
away with but i have learned that and
22:58
every now and then i feel like there's a
22:59
spear poking me in my head but i know
23:01
what that is and i'll just say several
23:03
witchcraft right now in jesus name and
23:05
it leaves
23:06
instantly when they did that
23:09
they were shocked
23:11
that instantly there began to be a
23:13
change in their child
23:15
and when they woke up this morning all
23:17
the pain was gone it was all
23:19
that's so good so it's what we know see
23:22
that's why he doesn't want us to be
23:23
clueless
23:25
his word is is a basic foundation for us
23:28
to operate from but when you begin to
23:30
hear directly through holy spirit he
23:32
will train you how to be powerful the
23:34
father it'll never go against what he
23:36
said in his word that you can't live in
23:38
darkness and play in the enemy's camp
23:40
and think you'll have authority
23:42
how can you have authority over somebody
23:44
you're partnering partnering with right
23:46
you can't you can't run out here and
23:47
willingly sin all the time and think you
23:49
can tell them they're not coming near
23:52
you or attacking you it's a lie from
23:54
hell you either live for god
23:57
or you don't live for him and god said
24:00
i'd rather have you hot or cold and if
24:02
you lukewarm i can't do much of anything
24:04
with you that's what that scripture says
24:06
that the scriptures i'll i'll spill you
24:08
out of my mouth that does not mean he
24:10
won't love you you won't get heaven that
24:12
means he can't give you authority to do
24:14
things if you're going to play in the
24:16
middle okay you can't play in the gray
24:17
area you're in the light or the dark and
24:19
i want to add this because i always like
24:21
to give you the more the reason why god
24:23
wants you hot or cold cold you're just
24:26
not doing nothing for living over here
24:27
in the world he said all i have to do is
24:29
get that person saved and they're hot
24:32
they're already actively working in the
24:34
darkness but if you're already on fire
24:36
for god and you're operating powerfully
24:38
you right where he wants you but if
24:40
you're cold you know really still cold
24:42
doing nothing don't even know him he
24:44
said that person who already is doing
24:46
something even though it's not right
24:48
when i get them saved they will be hot
24:51
but the lukewarm they don't want to make
24:53
commitments they don't want to try to
24:55
find out more they're not hungry for him
24:57
they're just hanging on till they die
24:58
and go to heaven one day
25:00
and i i can tell you you will be so
25:02
grateful that you operated and
25:04
manifested the power of the living god
25:07
and what we're about to see in this
25:08
earth will shock people coming from
25:11
believers who run after god not step
25:14
back not jumped off the path especially
25:16
in this time you will be accelerated and
25:19
you will be operating powerfully for him
25:22
with him and because of him
25:24
jesus christ in this world
25:26
that's good well kel we have a lot of
25:28
questions before we get into them
25:30
questions about heaven and related is
25:31
there anything else you want to add are
25:33
you ready for the questions oh i'm ready
25:35
for the question all right so here's the
25:37
first question and i guess i missed this
25:39
a couple times illumination said i
25:41
missed this so here we go
25:43
uh merrill lynn
25:44
interesting spelling
25:47
m-a-r-o-l-y-n-n-e what an what a neat
25:50
way to spell maryland marilyn asked i
25:53
was born with as an idiot
25:56
twin
25:58
uh but yet we look nothing alike as many
26:00
do look like
26:02
god doesn't have even two snowflakes the
26:04
same will twins look alike in heaven
26:06
there's two questions well twins look
26:08
alike in heaven
26:10
and the second question is is there any
26:12
reason why god would give
26:14
uh two births at the same time i guess i
26:16
guess they're asking why are there twins
26:18
why did he do twins okay so first one is
26:22
what is uh will they look alike in
26:24
heaven
26:26
i'm sure it says in the bible we'll go
26:28
back to the bible it says you will be
26:29
known as you were known that means
26:31
people will recognize you like they
26:33
recognize you on the earth you'll look a
26:35
whole lot better i mean the light of
26:36
god's coming out of you you've got joy
26:38
on you you're excited all the time um so
26:41
there could be twins and maybe one was
26:43
happy one wasn't maybe it was gonna be
26:45
maybe it was whatever but he made you
26:47
for a purpose and yes he did make twins
26:50
for a purpose many times twins have a
26:53
very strong connection
26:55
and if you learn how to operate with god
26:57
with that strong connection it's it's
27:00
really it's almost like a two-fold chord
27:03
uh when you when you come together as a
27:05
twin and you have this connection that's
27:08
really different from other siblings
27:10
um it's because god made you that way on
27:13
purpose and yes you will still look like
27:14
you in heaven i see people who look
27:17
alike in heaven that they were twins on
27:19
the earth uh you don't lose that
27:21
and so but you say you have different
27:23
personalities or different likes like i
27:25
like chocolate i like vanilla whatever
27:27
stuff like that or i want to go to the
27:28
valley of the falls and you know i want
27:30
to go to passionate paradise or or i
27:32
want to go to the surf park and
27:34
everybody has their things they like but
27:36
twins and a lot of times do a lot of
27:39
things together and they have especially
27:41
a special bond and god did send people
27:44
as twins on purpose to the earth to have
27:46
that special bonding connection because
27:49
when he gets involved it's very powerful
27:52
well when they pray when they declare uh
27:54
together as twins and lots of times
27:56
they'll know what's going on with the
27:58
other even if they're not together at
27:59
all so
28:00
yeah
28:02
and if they're triplets it's even more
28:04
powerful
28:05
wow yeah wow okay that's interesting all
28:07
right simone asks
28:09
uh when we're singing and worshiping or
28:12
praying do our angels
28:14
do that with us do they or do they
28:16
worship uh with us is the actual
28:19
question do our angels worship with us
28:21
when we're worshiping
28:23
i think most of the time they're
28:25
watching up for your back
28:27
they know you're worshiping and they get
28:28
really excited i can tell you that your
28:30
angels get so excited when you anytime
28:33
you worship god if you're helping
28:35
another person they get really joyous
28:37
they get really joyous when you're
28:39
reading the word of god anytime
28:41
something you're doing that that
28:42
connects you to god but worship is very
28:45
powerful in heaven if you could see
28:47
worship in the spirit realm it's like it
28:49
does many things at one time when you
28:51
worship god from your heart you're so
28:54
dangerous against how missiles like
28:56
missiles come from you and shoot up into
28:58
the second heaven and they bust things
29:00
up in the second heaven because all
29:02
worship goes to god from this earth to
29:04
him that's where it goes actually goes
29:07
to these golden bowls before the altar
29:09
sometimes they come directly into him
29:11
and then he'll take it and he'll himself
29:13
put it in the gold i'm talking about the
29:14
father he'll put your praises like
29:17
incense and they'll put in these golden
29:18
bowls and when they're full he tips them
29:20
and the move of god comes to the earth
29:22
but you're also crushing plans of the
29:25
enemy when you worship
29:27
it is very powerful and it makes jesus
29:31
really really happy because you're
29:33
connecting saying you're hungry for him
29:36
any songs that adore him are the most
29:39
popular ones in heaven if it adores him
29:41
and who christ is and speaks about his
29:44
divinity or or what he has done for us
29:47
here on the earth they love it your
29:49
angels love it when you sing or worship
29:51
him so it's very powerful i see them in
29:54
the meetings worship i'll see them
29:56
worshiping their worship a lot more wild
29:58
than we do though many times they're
30:00
dancing they're spinning
30:02
um they'll walk in and out of you all
30:04
the time that you're worshiping your own
30:06
angels well the whole ceiling fills in
30:09
the sanctuary or wherever you're having
30:12
these meetings if it's outside if you
30:14
could see the seer the whole sky would
30:16
light up with the glory of god from the
30:18
worship coming from you
30:20
sends light into the darkness yeah did
30:22
you just say
30:24
your angels walk in and out of you did
30:26
did i hear you right okay you explained
30:29
that what do you mean because that's and
30:31
and do they they do that now not just in
30:34
heaven but they do that now they walk
30:37
what's what's going on when they do that
30:39
what happened
30:41
they're a spiritual being that's why
30:43
they can walk through the walls this
30:45
physical world is the second realm
30:48
the original realm was a spiritual realm
30:51
where all of things of god that's where
30:53
they live before he made a canvas and
30:55
put all the stars and the planets on it
30:58
it was only a spiritual world but it was
31:00
a literal world well because they're
31:03
protecting and guarding us oh they step
31:05
in and out sometimes i see you sit
31:07
actually
31:08
inside your angels sometimes or you
31:11
stand inside your angels they're always
31:13
right there by you uh uh and around you
31:16
no matter where you go sometimes you
31:18
walk through them and you don't even
31:19
know you're doing that because it's
31:21
they're they're spiritual beings
31:24
is it a protection thing uh because i've
31:27
never really explored this with you when
31:28
they walk in
31:30
you i get that they're spirit beings and
31:33
they can walk through walls and see men
31:35
in anything but when they're walking
31:37
through you what's being is something
31:39
must be being accomplished or they
31:40
wouldn't bother right so
31:43
they're making deposits god will send to
31:45
bother that you know it says your angel
31:47
memory he says in the bible that your
31:50
your angel's face is always before the
31:52
father remember that it says in the
31:53
bible oh yeah you always have more than
31:55
one you always have more than one
31:58
because one is always always with you
32:00
and so they'll take turns going before
32:02
the father sometimes they're saying
32:04
things or whatever he's calling them up
32:06
there and i've seen them
32:09
doing many things especially during a
32:11
meeting where they have mass miracles
32:13
they bring they're the ones who bring
32:14
the body parts down from heaven
32:16
your angel usually will get your body
32:19
part if you're lacking or need something
32:21
replaced or
32:23
if you've asked for uh like
32:25
help me with kindness i want more
32:26
kindness they'll the father will send a
32:29
deposit of kindness and they'll walk
32:30
through you and then part it into you
32:32
they'll literally hold it and walk
32:33
through you and put it inside of you in
32:35
your spirit
32:36
the uh i'm thinking of a specific
32:38
relative of mine i won't name it um
32:41
and they're walking away from the lord
32:43
and there's a whole bunch of new age
32:45
stuff going on and there's pictures on
32:47
the wall where they're doing this and
32:49
they're doing all these and they're
32:51
walking that's what they're doing
32:53
so what are their
32:54
angels have their do their angels leave
32:57
them because they're in this state do
32:59
their angels double up because they need
33:01
more help what what goes on
33:04
it depends on who's praying for those
33:06
people usually now if god has assigned
33:09
them to you your your guardian angel
33:11
comes while you're in the womb
33:13
it's waiting for you to be born
33:15
so they're with you before you get
33:17
involved in anything you have any
33:19
understanding of anything they're with
33:20
you from the time you're little and if
33:22
you see babies smile which i was holding
33:25
one the other night um they were looking
33:27
at my angel they couldn't take their
33:29
eyes off of my angel because i could see
33:31
my angel and my angels behind me or it
33:33
comes around me and they would look at
33:35
the angel continually i could see their
33:37
angels all the time they were right
33:38
there with that around that baby they
33:41
were somewhere in the room they had like
33:42
five different angels with them so
33:44
they're a prophet
33:46
they will be a prophet they're not gonna
33:48
become one they are one and so they have
33:50
more
33:51
depending on the assignment that god
33:53
gives you you have more angels if in a
33:56
different season in your life maybe you
33:57
normally have three he could send five
33:59
or ten more depending on where you're
34:01
going to be going for him or doing for
34:03
him so that changes but you always have
34:06
the ones he originally sent
34:08
waiting outside i see pregnant women all
34:10
the time with angels following them
34:12
around that is that babies angels so
34:15
they're with you from that time and a
34:17
lot of babies begin to smile they go
34:19
with looking at nothing and smiling no
34:20
they're looking at their own angels
34:22
and so uh the the angelic have a very
34:25
powerful assignment from god and it does
34:28
say he sends them to keep you and
34:29
protect you in all your ways
34:32
so most of the time it is sort of like a
34:35
protection thing
34:37
that they're assigned to you and
34:38
sometimes they've said whisper things in
34:40
your ear like make sure you stop don't
34:43
go if the lights change don't go yet
34:45
many times at your own angel saying that
34:48
to you
34:49
and of course the more of god you have
34:51
in you and uh people go i don't even
34:53
know what that means well do you
34:54
meditate about him do you talk to him
34:57
like he's actually there
34:58
people how do i build a relationship you
35:00
act like he's really there
35:02
and you talk to him just like as if you
35:04
could see him just tell him you know i
35:06
love you i'm so grateful to you for what
35:07
you've done i'm so excited about the
35:09
things that are about to take place in
35:11
the earth no matter what the news or
35:12
anyone else is saying you're believing
35:14
what god's timing is and the more you do
35:17
that the clearer you hear holy spirit
35:20
father of jesus christ
35:22
and i do know this the more that you
35:24
step out begin to believe what his word
35:27
says and then you live like you believe
35:29
it your spiritual ears will begin to be
35:33
open so my question on on this cat is
35:37
there are so you and i know
35:39
tons of people or stories about the same
35:43
that people who are called a high
35:45
calling in their life and something
35:47
happened and they began to just walk
35:49
away
35:50
and they began to experiment and they'll
35:53
one day they'll tell their story they
35:55
say i just was running away from god as
35:58
fast as i could go they'll say that so
36:00
when they're running away
36:03
and then in fact when they're what they
36:05
usually mean is i did this and i'm doing
36:07
this and i started doing that
36:09
what what are their angels
36:13
oh they don't leave
36:15
okay
36:16
they do not leave they're right there
36:18
beside you the whole time
36:20
and sometimes the choices you make
36:22
yourself as a person may get yourself in
36:25
a lot of trouble or maybe you begin to
36:28
reject the words of god i'm not saying
36:31
you abandon necessarily being a
36:33
christian it's like you're going more to
36:36
another another way like leaning on your
36:38
own understanding not what you learn
36:40
from the word and maybe you make
36:42
decisions where you yourself can get
36:44
hurt or whatever they double up what
36:46
they're doing for you i mean they don't
36:48
leave you they still try to influence
36:50
you
36:51
a lot of times they're shaking their
36:53
head i mean uh even they don't
36:56
sometimes they really do i see them roll
36:58
their eyes sometimes i think they're
37:00
saying the angels they have they have
37:02
personalities they're not robots
37:05
some will just begin to pray really hard
37:07
for you the other ones are like rolling
37:09
their eyes at you like come on
37:13
come on you need to you need to
37:14
understand you shouldn't be doing that
37:15
you shouldn't be going into that place
37:18
they will try to influence you if you go
37:20
into places that are really not good
37:21
they'll actually cover their eyes
37:24
wow and
37:26
they'll cover their eyes but they won't
37:27
leave you when
37:29
did you say
37:31
because we're talk about that our angels
37:33
do this they protect here
37:35
they stand and you know they block this
37:37
but did you say your angels pray for you
37:41
do angels pray so our angels pray like
37:44
we pray
37:46
they've got a prayer life as well is
37:48
that what you're saying life it's a
37:49
little bit different from ours
37:52
because they know the things the father
37:55
can do they know the things jesus christ
37:57
died for they'll begin to repeat what
37:59
the word has said and they will be
38:01
declaring the word over those people
38:03
that they have been assigned to they
38:05
don't just do it for anybody but the
38:07
ones that they were assigned to from the
38:08
time you know before they were born they
38:10
were sent to take them
38:12
when you die your guardian angel is the
38:14
one who escorts you to heaven whether
38:17
you're picked up in a chariot or where
38:19
you're picked up but some other way
38:20
there's many ways you can be transported
38:22
to heaven your own guardian angel when
38:24
you step out of this physical body and
38:26
your spirit man steps out the first
38:28
thing you'll see will be your own angel
38:31
good well well all right well um
38:34
this is a good question um this is
38:37
renee's asking i i he says i see or he i
38:40
can't tell i take care of my 98 year old
38:44
mother
38:45
who has dementia
38:46
who has dementia how can i lead her to
38:48
the lord i've tried to be simple but she
38:51
says quote what are you talking about
38:54
close quote
38:56
yeah when some people not everybody
38:59
i'd say that very carefully my mom is 90
39:02
she's sharp as attack people
39:04
and so um
39:05
it's just some people aren't some aren't
39:07
um what you do in that situation or i
39:10
can add something even more to that if
39:12
they're in the hospital and they're not
39:13
responding
39:14
you can speak to their spirit man
39:17
and i tell people there actually have
39:19
been people came back and get tested and
39:21
said even though i wasn't responding my
39:23
body wasn't responding i heard every
39:25
word you said their spirit may inherit
39:28
it i tell people don't ever stop
39:30
believing for their salvation don't ever
39:32
stop doing that and you can just say
39:34
very politely make sure you know jesus
39:36
christ
39:37
can can i help you pray to him
39:41
if they were born again and got born
39:42
again at a young age it's like god keeps
39:45
this
39:46
i don't want to say he has a hook in you
39:48
but it makes him you have a tie to him
39:51
you know it says that jesus is married
39:53
to the backslider right doesn't it say
39:55
that so even though you get off an area
39:57
you shouldn't be he doesn't leave you he
39:59
always has hope that you will recognize
40:02
him and go back to what you believed in
40:04
the beginning and so that's why your
40:06
angels will still pray and declare you
40:09
know to these people but as far as a
40:11
senior uh sometimes the closer they get
40:14
to 100 somewhere over 100 is still sharp
40:17
it depends on every single person is
40:19
different their soul processes things
40:21
differently some days are clearer than
40:24
other days so don't give up you know
40:27
speaking of being very gentle when you
40:28
speak to them whether and they're
40:30
already of the age while they're
40:31
sleeping is a good time to speak to them
40:34
that's good
40:35
does not ever sleep
40:37
and i i tell people still speak to them
40:39
still leave them in a prayer of
40:41
salvation if they're really
40:43
while they're asleep
40:44
please do that wow
40:47
you're serious you can lead a person
40:55
yes
40:56
and their spirit man can respond it will
41:00
totally respond and we ourselves have
41:03
heard i've lived in church my entire
41:04
life okay we were almost born on a pew i
41:06
tell people that's where we were every
41:09
service it was a six week six week
41:11
revival we were there every single
41:12
meeting uh that's where we lived it was
41:15
like our second home and so we heard a
41:17
lot of testimonies sometimes people miss
41:20
but we heard testimonies of people who
41:22
were in comas in the hospital and
41:24
they're and they weren't born again and
41:25
they their loved one would visit them
41:27
all the time they would put their hand
41:28
on them they would pray over them they
41:30
themselves would say now i believe that
41:32
you can hear me even though your flesh
41:34
can't respond i'm going to lead you in
41:36
this prayer and they would lead them in
41:38
the sinner's prayer like at least once
41:40
when they were coming to visit them and
41:42
now they they didn't die and go to
41:44
heaven these people lived they came back
41:46
and they said i heard you every time
41:50
you led me in that prayer i had to say
41:52
it now this was their spirit man even
41:54
though their flesh was then speaking
41:56
this was the actual person who came back
41:59
woke up out of the coma and said i heard
42:01
you say that every time he spoke to me
42:03
and they said thank you for not giving
42:04
up giving up on me but while i was out
42:08
my spirit man heard you and i received
42:10
christ
42:11
wow
42:12
you know there's no teaching about this
42:14
i mean this is wonderful news because i
42:17
didn't know you could lead someone to
42:18
the lord when they're in a coma or when
42:20
they're
42:21
when they're asleep that's phenomenal
42:23
cat i mean
42:25
your soul
42:26
you know your three parts right body
42:28
soul and spirit your soul never sleeps
42:32
your soul doesn't need to sleep it's a
42:34
spiritual thing your spirit man never
42:36
sleeps it's always awake and i encourage
42:40
people play some really powerful amazing
42:42
music in the room especially if people
42:44
are not feeling well the best thing you
42:46
can do
42:48
unless you if you're given a medicine
42:49
they've told you to give them medicine
42:51
this is before the whole virus thing i'm
42:53
not talking about that at all i'm not in
42:55
my opinions of that right now but
42:57
normally just not feeling well or maybe
42:59
the under doctor's care the best thing
43:01
you can do for that person is to play
43:04
the word of god or being spoken or to
43:07
play music that brings the presence of
43:10
god your spirit man and your soul will
43:12
get very strong because of that
43:15
but i always have encouraged people
43:17
since being young
43:19
don't give up on your family member and
43:21
please if you if you're standing for
43:22
their salvation
43:24
you'll find out later in heaven when you
43:26
see them there what your words spoke and
43:28
made a difference in their life so it's
43:30
important but again you can't you can't
43:33
sell the bad wicked evil things you're
43:35
saying if you're over here standing
43:36
right you're being double minded
43:39
yeah
43:40
you're staying in that gap you stay
43:42
there you declare over them i'm not
43:44
saying you have to pray pray
43:46
24 hours a day
43:47
back in the day you know i'm coming from
43:49
like born in the 50s people so i've seen
43:52
just about every move of god since the
43:53
50s there has been
43:55
and was a part of a lot of them and i'm
43:58
like i was surprised at what people
44:00
didn't understand god could do and and
44:03
would he actually do it and i'm like do
44:05
you not believe there is a god i mean i
44:07
think number one you really have to
44:09
believe when you receive christ it's he
44:12
steps inside of you he's there he's
44:15
actually with you all the time not just
44:17
your angels
44:19
and so i encourage people he's there
44:21
he's never going to leave yet says so
44:22
why not talk to him like i'm talking to
44:25
you like i can't see you but i feel like
44:27
i'm talking to thousands of people right
44:29
now when i speak and i'm serious like
44:32
steve said i'm serious everything god
44:34
taught me i had to live it that's how i
44:37
know these things work
44:39
but when when a mass of the body begins
44:42
to believe and live like he really is
44:45
and declare it and begin to speak to
44:47
things around you you'll be shocked how
44:50
different your life is you'll come home
44:52
walk into the presence of god because
44:54
you've invited a habitation of heaven by
44:57
what you're saying in your home where no
44:59
one's watching or looking what are you
45:02
watching what are you letting in your
45:03
home what are you letting come in from
45:05
the tv from the computer um it says in
45:08
the bible we'll be we will be held
45:10
account for every word
45:12
you know that we speak i'm not saying if
45:13
you're a believer you won't go to heaven
45:15
but
45:16
don't use wasteful things i don't spend
45:19
your time repeating what they're
45:21
advertising about hell going on in the
45:23
earth right now
45:24
are you talking more about god and his
45:27
plans and his power are you talking more
45:29
about the power of the enemy and that's
45:31
how fear gets into people if all you're
45:33
talking about is how afraid you are and
45:35
how wicked and bad and evil everything
45:37
is out there people don't even think
45:38
about god if i talk about the life of
45:40
god and his power and his plans that he
45:43
has for this earth he made it he held it
45:46
in his hands and made this earth he's
45:49
not ignoring anything he knows what's
45:51
going on in justice i just have to say
45:53
holy spirit saying yes
45:54
justice has already been released from
45:56
heaven
45:57
it's waiting to act
45:59
so why not tell your children ask your
46:02
children what is god saying to you can
46:04
you hear his voice he wants to speak to
46:06
you do you know god wants you to be
46:08
great for him that the invention
46:10
creativity that will happen in your
46:11
lifetime will be phenomenal
46:13
this little baby i was holding all i
46:15
said was powerful exciting things a
46:18
little baby like a month old
46:20
and that baby began to grin and almost
46:22
laugh at the words i was giving was life
46:25
to them
46:26
okay it was life to this little tiny
46:29
baby who who didn't really know anything
46:32
except that was somebody speaking light
46:34
and life to him and he didn't really
46:36
know me but it didn't matter i was
46:38
giving him what god was saying about him
46:40
and it was changing the way he responded
46:43
in seconds
46:45
so
46:47
what are you feeding your family with
46:49
your words
46:50
are you giving them life
46:52
are you empowering them inspiring them
46:55
to be something great for god regardless
46:57
of what's going on in this world this
46:59
world does not own you
47:01
okay you're in the hand of god if you
47:02
belong to him expect him expectancy with
47:06
god is just as powerful as reading the
47:08
word and praying expectancy
47:10
i say i ask for and receive expectancy
47:13
the expectancy and the excitement god
47:15
that you carry i ask for that and i bind
47:17
that to my soul and it's one of the
47:19
reasons why i say excited but if all
47:22
you're saying is did you hear what they
47:23
said here did you hear that now this is
47:25
what happened and don't say no this is
47:27
going to happen say i'm i'm not
47:28
tolerating any of this stuff being
47:30
forced i decide what god wants for me
47:33
i'm living in my life's going in in that
47:36
direction the only new normal for me
47:37
will be god invading my place that's
47:40
good that's good
47:42
to wrap up then let me i want to really
47:44
clarify this 98 year old mother who has
47:47
dementia which means
47:49
she just she's not there she may or may
47:51
not be there at all
47:53
she's yeah or if she remembers something
47:55
it's for 30 seconds i know my mom's
47:57
headed that way so if whether it's a 98
48:00
year old mother who has dementia like
48:02
this question
48:04
or a 10 year old or 20 year old
48:07
who has me who is so mentally challenged
48:10
that they they do not relate to language
48:13
as you and i know it
48:15
okay so they so as far as we know their
48:18
brain doesn't work
48:20
even in that case you while they're
48:23
asleep you can lead them to the lord
48:25
right
48:26
i will say this because i have to add
48:28
anyone who is um of an older age or even
48:32
like you said 20 if they're mentally
48:34
challenged
48:36
if their physical brain doesn't operate
48:38
like ours god treats them like a little
48:41
child
48:43
and and let me tell you even at the time
48:45
of their death he will present himself
48:47
to them
48:48
he will lead them to him himself
48:52
he is not an unjust god and if that was
48:55
if that's how they were born or
48:56
something happened to them and mentally
48:59
they can't process or they can't think
49:01
he does not hold that against them but
49:03
they are treated by god as a child as a
49:07
young child and he's not going to send
49:09
them to hell he will make sure they have
49:11
an opportunity to know him in the bible
49:14
it says i make myself known to every man
49:17
that means every human being
49:20
so that part i can tell you the mentally
49:22
challenged like that god knows that
49:25
they're like a child but i would totally
49:27
still speak to them and say jesus loves
49:30
you
49:31
if that's all you can get into them it's
49:33
going to go in their spirit it will
49:35
begin to actually affect them if you put
49:38
words of life in them god loves you he
49:40
sent you here uh to be with us you know
49:42
we love you god uh has plans for you one
49:46
day you'll get to see him in person
49:48
those are words of hope
49:50
well anytime hope uh
49:53
the hope brings glory to god which is in
49:56
the word of god christ in you is the
50:00
hope of glory that you saying words of
50:03
hope to people that draws the glory of
50:06
god and that can even bring healing it
50:08
can begin to change physically the way
50:10
their brain operates
50:12
and and they've even tested that on
50:14
plants just relating a plant who has no
50:17
real life a plant you speak kind words
50:20
to and encourage this plant i love that
50:22
you're growing how beautiful you are wow
50:25
really
50:26
they have proved scientifically
50:29
some plants that they're bashed and
50:31
falsely accused they did this is a real
50:34
i had many trials done in science labs
50:37
that plant died
50:39
but the one that had words of hope and
50:42
power and those released that plant
50:44
flourished these are living things not
50:47
with the soul but the living in their
50:50
words affected the plants how do you
50:53
think they're going to be in to affect
50:54
the soul of a person no matter what kind
50:57
of situation their physical man is in
51:00
their spirit man is made perfect their
51:02
spirit man is made perfect and your
51:05
spirit sometimes leaps for joy even if
51:08
your physical man doesn't understand it
51:10
so i have to say
51:12
these people who say you know it's
51:13
important what you say be kind to people
51:16
even some of them if they don't have an
51:17
understanding of god they have learned
51:19
their self
51:20
kindness and hope begin to change people
51:24
even people who aren't nice even people
51:27
with all their mental faculties it
51:29
matters what you say to people
51:31
and and i always try to find someone
51:34
some every day to be kind to or to help
51:36
or to give them hope and i don't know
51:39
these people and they don't even know
51:41
who i am but when you release words of
51:44
hope it like pierces the darkness
51:47
in a person and light begins to come
51:50
from the words you speak words look like
51:52
little missiles of light going into a
51:55
person's spirit
51:57
and will begin to affect their natural
51:59
man
52:01
that's good that's good now you we had
52:03
talked to they someone wrote here that
52:06
was episode 57 where you said there will
52:08
become
52:09
cities of light that will start to
52:11
happen
52:12
and the person's asking in reference to
52:14
that
52:15
is this something that we can look
52:17
forward to in our live lifetime and how
52:20
soon
52:21
if there's any concept you have as far
52:23
as when will this happen or how soon can
52:25
we look forward to cities of light
52:28
i absolutely expect that to happen
52:30
probably in most people's lifetime
52:33
um because i have to say god has talked
52:36
about a divine decade a double decade
52:39
which would be like 2000 i think that
52:41
was like 2000 2010 2000 2010 2020 2020
52:46
like to 2040
52:48
so many major changes are going to come
52:50
and i have been telling people watch for
52:53
the first three months of this year for
52:56
things to be seen and heard you haven't
52:58
seen or heard wow i'm i'm not saying the
53:01
whole the whole flip they call it flip
53:03
whatever you can call it it's actually a
53:05
turning more than is like a flip thing
53:08
but when you begin to see that the hand
53:10
god turning his hand
53:13
literally what you will begin to see in
53:15
these next few months is so much
53:18
darkness will come to light there's a
53:20
lot of darkness out there a lot of it's
53:22
still hidden people are getting away
53:24
with things but in these first three
53:25
months you will see
53:27
major people exposed and never thought
53:30
they would be exposed and and that is
53:32
very key to what he is doing in the
53:35
earth now but i fully expect regions of
53:39
regions of light to exist on the earth
53:41
because i was taken into the regions of
53:43
light and i do happen to know this city
53:45
i live in will become a region of light
53:48
he showed me at one point demons leaving
53:51
the city like dust they were leaving
53:54
like dust because the glory of god was
53:56
beginning to be embedded here and coming
53:58
from the people who live here
54:01
begin to operate and what he has called
54:03
them to operate in and i know there's a
54:06
lot of people coming to florida what
54:07
they don't understand and i'm laughing
54:10
at certain people who just bought
54:11
property here from the left
54:14
they're stepping into the greatest
54:15
battle station on earth god said florida
54:17
was the battle station of the host on
54:19
earth so they're stepping into a very
54:22
dangerous place
54:24
yeah yeah there's some people that'll
54:27
probably lose that property that they're
54:29
and other people
54:31
other people that will that will join
54:34
join the kingdom you know so let's see
54:36
um this is just let me add one more
54:39
thing go ahead yes please when he showed
54:41
me this about this city um we were sent
54:44
here back in 61 though we have no
54:46
intention of leaving by the way there's
54:48
150 of us people um
54:50
and some of them are rednecks i don't
54:52
think i'm a redneck but i tell you what
54:54
i am a manifested daughter of god and i
54:55
already know that if you don't like it
54:57
why don't you start living it okay i'm
54:59
not against you being that it's what you
55:02
choose but he caught me up into space
55:06
over the earth by the way it was round
55:09
there you go again the holy spirit
55:11
always does that i love it there's no
55:13
flat earth he never made a flat earth
55:15
heaven is not flat earth is a shadow of
55:18
heaven god's home is a world a whole
55:20
world bigger than our probably of
55:22
everything that you can see out there
55:23
but he caught me up and he had put a
55:25
grid around the earth like a grid you
55:27
know people know what a great is up
55:29
above the earth and there were states
55:32
were lighting up he began to light up
55:34
these states
55:35
that i saw and he said these will all be
55:37
regions of light and there were more
55:39
regions of light than of darkness really
55:43
oh yeah more regions of light because
55:45
the body will begin to get and
55:46
understand who they are begin to operate
55:48
in the fullness of what christ gave them
55:51
and the more they see it happen the more
55:52
they'll get so inspired and excited and
55:55
then they become empowered because of
55:58
running after jesus christ i think there
56:00
also will be
56:01
many sightings of christ now in saying
56:04
all that the enemy will be out there
56:06
trying to demonstrate he is somebody and
56:08
he has something which at one point a
56:10
lot of people will laugh at because
56:12
there's so much of god around that's how
56:15
different it's going to be i saw regions
56:17
of light i told people already las vegas
56:19
will be a region of las vegas and reno
56:21
will both be a region of light i saw
56:23
california as a region of light people
56:25
so no matter what's going on there now
56:28
they better change or they won't want to
56:30
stay because you know what the devil
56:31
doesn't want to stay where a lot of god
56:33
is he just doesn't want to and it what
56:36
will happen is so many people will begin
56:37
to run to god and demonstrate and the
56:40
miraculous that will be happening the
56:42
new inventions and stuff this is what's
56:44
coming this is going to be your new norm
56:47
so why not prepare your children that
56:49
greatness is coming they're going to be
56:50
a part of this don't don't ever let fear
56:52
be put in your children by lies that are
56:54
being told everywhere you will see some
56:57
of the best the greatest justice you've
56:59
ever seen on the earth but on the other
57:00
side of that the greatest celebration
57:03
the greatest invention and uh people
57:05
being inspired people caring about each
57:08
other some churches will not make a
57:10
denomination anymore they're just going
57:12
to belong to jesus christ not that there
57:14
won't be some organizations out there uh
57:16
i'm just saying life will be so
57:19
different
57:20
that people will want to know christians
57:23
that is how different it will be from
57:25
now they won't be listening to the left
57:28
it will start to slipped it out they
57:30
won't be listening to things that are
57:31
the darkness or doom and gloom or the
57:33
takeover theory that isn't what's going
57:35
to happen okay the only theory that's
57:37
going to happen is jesus christ the
57:39
plans of jesus christ the timeline of
57:42
god and that's why he shows me things so
57:44
i can empower you by these words and if
57:47
you're from the other side you don't
57:48
like me it's too late people you're
57:50
filled with the anointing you can't get
57:52
rid of it
57:55
that's really good by the way that's a
57:56
really good word about california
57:58
because i was raised in california and
58:00
i've been thinking man maybe i need to
58:02
because i just thought one day when i
58:04
buy my uh vacation home okay that's not
58:08
now but one day
58:10
um
58:11
i'd like it to be in california but i
58:13
thought maybe i better change that maybe
58:15
that needs to be in florida where
58:16
there's actual freedom but you're saying
58:19
kevin he never played both places steve
58:21
it's okay okay that sounds good you know
58:24
what i need is one of those portal doors
58:27
that i can walk through
58:29
so hey by the way speaking of portal
58:32
doors you said in heaven there's doors
58:35
that you walk through and then suddenly
58:36
you're in another place
58:38
cat is there a time in the future where
58:42
where there's a reality on earth or are
58:45
there seers that kind of do that now on
58:48
earth where they walk through a place
58:50
and suddenly they're in singapore or
58:52
suddenly they're in you know whatever
58:55
timbuktu have you heard about that kind
58:57
of thing
58:58
i have heard about it actually it's been
59:00
several years since i heard the people
59:02
now
59:03
and there's a lot into saying that whole
59:05
thing and i always take time to explain
59:08
i'm not saying every single person would
59:10
be able to do that that's not what i'm
59:12
saying and and i'm saying some of them
59:14
didn't even know how it happened i know
59:17
how that happens in the spirit but i'm
59:19
not saying every person who god just
59:21
inspires you and he'll say step in there
59:23
and they'll open the door and step in
59:24
and they won't be in that same room
59:26
they'll be somewhere else sometimes
59:27
it'll be just that simple
59:29
i do know there are people that
59:30
understand about going in and out of the
59:33
spirit realm but you have to be very
59:35
careful i'm not saying that out of fear
59:37
i'm saying that out of wisdom and let
59:39
the holy spirit guide you and all that
59:41
there's some people who think well we
59:42
can all do this and then they get they
59:44
forget who jesus christ is they forget
59:46
he's a part of this and now they have to
59:49
say it will happen more and more but yes
59:52
it does that's how people travel in
59:53
heaven a lot of them will step into a
59:56
door or into beams of light and they
59:58
will take them to a whole different
59:59
place in heaven there absolutely is
60:01
going to be new ways to travel like
60:03
trains will run on beams of light not on
60:06
rails on the ground that is absolutely
60:08
going to happen on this that's here on
60:09
earth and you're saying that's here
60:11
here on earth that will happen here
60:13
they'll have ways to like hold highways
60:15
that will be from um
60:18
i don't understand because you know i
60:20
had a 12th grade education decided to
60:21
disappoint you people uh i've i've
60:24
graduated from the college in heaven but
60:26
but not on the earth okay and it's okay
60:29
to pursue a higher education just don't
60:30
let that place tell you there is no god
60:33
just very where you go but i can tell
60:36
you yes i was shown things that would
60:38
literally be created on the earth and i
60:41
do know this and will still say five
60:43
major diseases including cancer will no
60:45
longer exist on this earth and that will
60:48
not be very far down the road it may not
60:51
i'm not saying it'd be 10 20 years down
60:52
the road at all i think those are going
60:54
to happen probably within the next
60:57
several years maybe between five and ten
60:59
years these five major diseases won't be
61:01
on the earth that alone will change
61:03
people's lives new ways to transport
61:06
that won't cost a lot of money energy
61:08
comes down from up in space
61:10
captured and brought to this earth will
61:12
not be very far down the road that that
61:14
happens and it may not be in somebody's
61:16
lifetime but i was shown i saw a lot of
61:20
buildings and things that remained the
61:21
same i saw a lot of things that were
61:23
different i've been taking you know five
61:25
years in the future 15
61:27
30 50 100
61:30
almost 150 years and guess what the
61:32
tribulation hadn't happened people
61:34
stopped trying to ride out on the
61:35
rapture rug the loading state the
61:38
greater things you will see happen on
61:40
the earth if i was somebody well i am
61:42
somebody
61:43
i want to be here as long as he has me
61:46
here
61:47
because i can make a difference in the
61:50
lives of people and i already know
61:52
what's coming
61:53
and the medical field will change
61:55
educational field will change the
61:56
business world will majorly change uh
61:59
and even the christian world itself
62:02
would begin to actually act like there
62:04
is a god people other nations and high
62:07
level people will seek people out to
62:09
find out where they got revelation from
62:11
and and and actually take it and act on
62:14
it so there's things hidden in the
62:16
ground like well not just the glory but
62:18
i'm talking about natural things hidden
62:20
that we will discover that will help
62:22
improve our life in this world and this
62:25
is god's plan for these days he chose
62:28
you in a powerful time on the earth all
62:30
the stuff going on around you
62:33
is about exposing evil
62:35
it is not about evil taking over you
62:38
know and cat uh you know who kathy
62:41
walters is and she was a friend of
62:43
arthur burt who's gone home to be at the
62:45
lord bert with a teeth there's a burke
62:47
with a k we're not talking about that
62:49
one is arthur burt with the t he's one
62:51
of them that said 2012
62:53
uh was the beginning of
62:56
the kingdom age he's one of those
62:59
but before he went and he he tells the
63:01
story about he was in an airport
63:03
and and he wanted to use the restroom
63:05
and god said take your bags with you to
63:08
the air to the bathroom he goes lord i
63:10
don't need take your bags with you to
63:13
the bathroom so he goes into the
63:15
bathroom with his bags he comes out and
63:17
he's in another country
63:19
airplane you know so that that's not
63:22
technology that per se that's that's an
63:25
encounter that's a supervision
63:28
you know josh uh i can't think of he
63:30
plays the keyboard
63:32
josh joshua people know who i'm talking
63:34
about um he's a he's a young youngish
63:37
man i mean he's probably 40s or
63:39
something but he's been transported
63:42
philip the philip the deacon all he was
63:44
was a deacon and he was transported so
63:47
that is going to happen more and more
63:49
isn't it yes it will absolutely happen
63:52
more and more yes it will
63:54
and we've heard you and i have heard and
63:56
as we wrap up here you know i've heard i
63:58
think man well
64:00
johnson who said that you know god took
64:03
him
64:04
forward in time
64:06
this is a few years ago to 2022
64:09
and and no one was wearing masks you
64:11
remember that story he said no one was
64:13
wearing this and he said
64:15
and he asked someone what and he
64:17
realized he was
64:18
he said what year is this and the person
64:20
said it's 20 22 and he said who's the
64:23
president
64:24
and they said donald trump so you know
64:27
i've been looking forward to that
64:28
because god took him there
64:30
you know and
64:31
kat let me ask you a question about
64:34
that
64:35
make this kind of the final one you've
64:37
said
64:38
god has taken you
64:41
and shown you the future when he shows
64:44
you that there's these different kinds
64:46
of encounters one is you're with him and
64:48
then he just shows you the future he
64:50
takes you there another one is he
64:52
transports you
64:55
as he literally transports you which
64:58
which is it when he when god takes you
65:00
to show you the future
65:03
um
65:04
well most of the time if he starts
65:05
talking about the future he literally
65:07
takes me there okay like i'm there like
65:10
i'm walking on the ground i see all the
65:12
stuff around me i hear the sights and
65:14
the aromas i see the activity
65:16
and
65:17
when that's happened to you you should
65:19
never forget that you should never
65:21
forget that
65:22
but um he's also taken to me to other
65:25
places he's taken me backward in time
65:27
like literally transported me i felt
65:30
myself moving one time and i was taken
65:33
back to the tomb of christ after the
65:35
stone had been rolled away i actually
65:38
did that and was in the garden that was
65:40
before i was with you all and elijah
65:42
listen we visited that same place i saw
65:45
the same two angels there
65:48
that were there when i was taken back
65:50
wow those angels were still there and
65:53
you know they were because when they
65:54
came to look and they said why are you
65:56
looking for the living
65:57
among the dad remember those angels have
65:59
said that those are the same angels who
66:00
were still posted there i saw them there
66:03
when we went to israel uh just a couple
66:05
years ago
66:06
that's amazing by the way i just
66:08
remembered it's joshua mills is the is
66:10
the name i was trying to remember uh
66:12
joshua mills he's a great great person
66:14
and he sought the
66:16
encounters
66:18
he'll describe how he sought the
66:20
encounters other people like yourself
66:23
you've said i've never sought the
66:24
encounters if i remember right but
66:27
joshua is one of those the reason i kind
66:29
of appreciate that side is because
66:33
um well first of all because i've never
66:35
been
66:35
transported in time so i'm thinking if i
66:38
get permission to at least see the
66:40
encounter maybe i'll do it but anyway
66:44
he tells a story about walking through
66:46
walls and starting to walk through walls
66:48
and it freaked him out
66:50
he pulled back but yeah we have amazing
66:52
times ahead of us amazing feelings well
66:56
i guess that's our time tell uh
66:58
tell folks how they can get a hold of
67:00
your website we've got
67:01
revealingheaven.com on the screen what
67:03

03:54
for a long time i'm i'm pinching myself
03:56
that i'm even that god's put me here to
03:59
even be doing this i mean it's it's like
04:01
is this real god
04:03
but um in 2017 jeff if you want to pull
04:06
up that picture i went to her first
04:08
warrior women's conference in florida
04:12
and uh there's my mom with the dark hair
04:15
there's me there's cat and my sister and
04:18
we all went to see you cat and i
04:20
remember during this conference
04:23
you said to us something incredible you
04:25
said every woman that's here there's a
04:28
hallway in heaven where you're there's a
04:30
photo of you and your name that you were
04:33
part of the first warrior women's
04:35
conference i'll never forget that you
04:37
said that because
04:38
when i first started um
04:40
following you i was i was really hungry
04:42
for more and more of jesus more and more
04:44
of truth more and more of the reality of
04:46
who jesus is and cat you've taught me so
04:49
much about cleansing my soul and so much
04:52
about the lord and just really helped
04:53
deepen my connection with him so thank
04:55
you
04:56
um it's just it's so exciting to have
04:58
you on here so let's bring on kat kerr
05:01
for today's show
05:03
did you did you get a little laugh out
05:05
of that picture
05:07
no um there are many many many pictures
05:10
we all had taken together during the
05:13
event but
05:14
um
05:15
i i love the faculty women so powerful
05:20
and the holy spirit always gives me
05:22
little tips throughout the day without
05:24
even asking for them and he said
05:28
uh by the way i need to add something
05:30
else besides that well i think jen's at
05:32
one point is going to be speaking
05:34
somewhere and she decided she's going to
05:35
speak um
05:37
uh like something about the difference
05:40
between men and women even though she's
05:41
not married you know she's lived in like
05:43
a tribe forever she's got seven brothers
05:46
and uh a lot of it's hilarious and this
05:49
is about the difference in men and women
05:50
this whole thing i'm gonna say
05:52
uh that um
05:54
that she knows all the inside stuff okay
05:57
she knows a lot about guys and how they
05:59
think
06:00
maybe they should think a lot harder
06:02
before they do things that type of thing
06:07
so but god does have a powerful things
06:09
he does with women and we are different
06:12
okay we're steadfast you're not going to
06:14
pull us away from something we're going
06:15
to be like you know like a lion going
06:18
after something and uh especially don't
06:20
touch anybody we know or we love you're
06:23
in trouble and the holy spirit and i
06:25
were talking about her discussing those
06:27
things with people one day and the holy
06:29
spirit said you know
06:31
uh
06:32
the lord had more women following him
06:34
than men
06:36
oh yes you know why he'd never get lost
06:40
he knew where everything was he'd always
06:41
have food to eat and he'd have people on
06:44
your side how about that
06:49
it is true women went with them
06:51
everywhere they went
06:52
and uh and that was known so when jesus
06:55
traveled by foot people
06:58
he could have gone on the spirit realm
06:59
but then what was the point nobody would
07:00
see him right he'd be right there with
07:02
him but nobody would see him but he when
07:04
he traveled they would put up camp
07:06
sometimes if they couldn't find lodging
07:09
and jesus paid for the lodging no matter
07:11
where they went because guess what he
07:12
was not poor that's just for free
07:15
he became poor that we might be rich he
07:17
became poor because he left heaven okay
07:20
he didn't live poor on the earth but by
07:22
heaven's standards he was but he had had
07:25
a lot more women with them guess what
07:27
they never argued they never second
07:29
guessed i never doubted
07:32
you know doubting thomas i just had that
07:34
for free and for whatever but the women
07:37
the captain is going for him they made
07:40
the plans when he was going into the
07:41
next place they made preparations
07:44
because you remember when when adam was
07:46
created god well maybe i'll think about
07:49
this okay now
07:51
i better send help i better send big
07:54
help i'll name her woman like wow look
07:57
at this man it's better than the table
08:02
this was all from the holy spirit while
08:03
i was just in the kitchen i was trying
08:06
so hard not to laugh at him that's why
08:07
they call him the drama king but it is
08:09
absolutely true he had his 12 disciples
08:12
but they had they had a lot of women
08:14
that traveled with him to make sure they
08:15
all got fed took care of the
08:17
preparations and stuff and
08:19
jesus um
08:21
said jesus loved having them with him
08:23
because he always had so many on his
08:25
side how about that
08:28
amen so women are powerful tools in
08:31
god's hands because they were press in
08:33
you know i think they don't have a
08:35
problem being intimate or personal
08:38
with the father with the son of the holy
08:39
spirit men need you need to break that
08:41
wall down and you just get in that place
08:43
too
08:44
uh that you hear very clearly and in
08:46
these days things that never been done
08:49
before we're about to step into them and
08:52
i need to add this for free the holy
08:54
spirit said in the bible when it says uh
08:57
that there is no difference in male and
08:59
female let's talk about in the spirit
09:01
realm in dominion in authority in the
09:04
spirit there is no difference between a
09:07
male or female that means they all can
09:10
rule equally in great authority and
09:12
power no matter whether you're a man or
09:15
a woman you still have the same level of
09:17
authority can run after all of it
09:19
we can all be kings priests and lords
09:23
in the kingdom which jesus talked about
09:25
all the time so there you go there's a
09:26
plug for women
09:28
i love you
09:32
so all the warrior women yeah
09:35
i know there's many people watching that
09:36
was probably at those uh that conference
09:38
too screaming i think it's wonder woman
09:41
but we were on behalf of the lord
09:44
we were watching we wore we warned in
09:47
those things i mean we've bored and
09:48
every one of them was so powerful i
09:50
think one time uh women were there from
09:53
40 countries in one of the events it's
09:55
like like the second or third one and we
09:57
all declared over every single country
10:00
and i know that even in the time right
10:02
now god won't forget us declaring over
10:04
those countries
10:06
so anyway i'm so happy you were there
10:09
and uh i don't know if you were there at
10:11
the time that we actually had the photo
10:12
machine
10:14
that was set up and uh we took pictures
10:17
with like everything it was like 700
10:19
women that took hours but it was so much
10:21
fun
10:22
well that's one thing i i loved about
10:24
going because you just we could come up
10:26
and talk to you after and you would take
10:28
pictures with us and you're just so down
10:30
to earth i mean you are like you are on
10:32
here you're just down to earth
10:34
very genuine loving person such a gentle
10:37
humble spirit um you're very strong and
10:40
powerful in the lord while you're
10:41
ministering but when i come up to meet
10:44
you you're you've extremely humble and
10:46
gentle and that really marked me um when
10:49
i first met you so thank you for saying
10:51
yes to jesus and thank you for all you
10:53
give to the body of christ do you have
10:56
do you have any updates that you want to
10:58
share with us um oh wow are there
11:01
updates people
11:04
yay
11:09
i i told people
11:11
at the end of us here to start watching
11:13
the first three months of this year the
11:16
first three months there will be so much
11:19
exposure
11:20
uh just in the news i mean it's going to
11:23
be the reality that it's happening and
11:26
there's some places some news uh feeds
11:28
aren't even hiding what's going on
11:31
but several countries okay
11:34
not talking about america at this moment
11:36
but several countries have dumped
11:38
including england uh and mostly around
11:41
the uk the other ones will follow but
11:44
england has totally dumped all mandates
11:48
they're not doing the vaccines they're
11:49
not doing the mass thing the social
11:51
distancing they have decided to have
11:54
their country back and that's what they
11:55
said
11:56
we're getting back to real life they
11:58
found out in their test
12:00
that the people who recovered faster by
12:03
the way
12:04
from when they did get that virus were
12:06
the ones who hadn't had the vaccine
12:09
this is big news everywhere not not
12:12
not with a bunch of us knew it
12:14
that you were better off uh just with
12:17
your natural immunities you know facing
12:20
that thing and some maybe some other um
12:22
homeopathic things which means natural
12:24
things but they when they found out when
12:27
that report was given to the top person
12:29
in in london in in europe
12:33
they said forget it we're ditching it
12:35
all and this should be in the major news
12:37
lines already they're ditching it all
12:39
they're not taking anybody's universe
12:42
universal mandates forget that happening
12:45
they said people were better off they're
12:46
happier they think that kids should be
12:48
able to smile at each other uh see their
12:51
families and hug each other
12:53
and and just let whatever takes its
12:55
course you know people who don't know
12:57
this um the flu at one point uh back
13:01
before this thing came up i think they
13:02
were calling everything the virus i just
13:05
have to say that and that is absolute
13:07
truth i know people went to the doctors
13:09
and they saw that it was on the records
13:11
and make them erase it because they had
13:13
just had the flu they had a head cold
13:16
anything that they were told in the
13:18
medical community they had to put it
13:20
down as that as proof that it was still
13:22
around
13:23
i'm not saying it's not there but i'm
13:25
saying people virus
13:27
not disease not a plague
13:30
and that is the truth that's how you
13:32
have to say it stop calling it a disease
13:34
or a plague it's not
13:36
okay the flu is a virus there's
13:38
different viruses that come around
13:40
seasonally
13:41
and i'm not making fun of it because i
13:43
know there's people who lost their lives
13:45
mainly probably from the vaccine or how
13:48
they were handled during that time but
13:50
i'm telling you the uk
13:52
especially london is not having anything
13:55
to do with it literally i think as of
13:58
today
13:59
they're ditching it all and the masks
14:02
are going to be taken off the kids in
14:03
school in the universities isn't this
14:06
awesome news i am so excited now if you
14:10
feel like you have to wear a mask and
14:12
then wear it but i think we here in
14:14
america should have the right over our
14:17
own lives not to be forced or controlled
14:21
when we are free
14:22
maybe those people don't want to be free
14:24
who are mandating it although i think a
14:26
lot of them have lived a lot freer than
14:28
the people in this country you're about
14:30
to see major major changes happen in our
14:33
own country
14:34
i do know that one thing was just put
14:36
forth about demanding people have the uh
14:40
the uh the vaccine or they lose their
14:42
jobs i think you're about to see that
14:44
dumped really fast coming up especially
14:47
with uh you know the the europe uh
14:49
getting involved in this stuff one other
14:51
country
14:52
it could be switzerland i think possibly
14:54
that was brought up but i'm getting this
14:57
is not was it was inside information but
14:59
now it's known information because they
15:02
actually put it in the news uh the the
15:05
head of the um
15:06
uh of london saying we're not doing this
15:08
anymore it's over as far as we're
15:10
concerned it's gonna be life with
15:13
freedom in it
15:14
hallelujah thank you jesus
15:17
we know that's the lord thank you lord
15:20
thank you god
15:21
where the spirit of the lord is there's
15:23
liberty so we thank you holy spirit for
15:25
moving for all those precious people in
15:28
london and over those precious children
15:30
and we declare the same thing over
15:32
america freedom
15:34
unmask the children freedom thank you
15:37
holy spirit for it um it's it's shifting
15:40
and changing and it's coming here in its
15:42
fullness so we thank you god
15:45
is there anything else that you
15:47
want to share do you want to get into
15:48
the questions i think that was the main
15:51
thing i think the only other thing
15:53
it may not hit the headline yet but it's
15:55
about to
15:56
that the the military and this has
15:59
already been released in many different
16:01
places not that you'll may see it on our
16:03
news but our own military have been
16:05
doing their own covert operations it's
16:08
not covert anymore uh whether they'll
16:10
allow it to be said or not but they've
16:12
been doing tests on the vaccine from day
16:15
one their cells and this is what happens
16:18
though when evil tries to take over they
16:21
overlook a lot of things they think they
16:22
already have under control
16:24
not knowing excuse me
16:30
i'm so excited
16:32
not knowing when you try to take a
16:34
country that is free you're going to
16:36
have the worst days of your life trying
16:38
to do that because i've lived in this
16:41
country since i was born obviously
16:43
and uh i know this about americans you
16:46
push him too hard and they're going to
16:48
start saying we're not doing this okay
16:51
where's your million million army come
16:54
to try to come and get us it's never
16:56
going to happen they operate in fear
16:58
i think those in fear right now a lot of
17:01
the ones trying to push things on us or
17:03
hide things from us but the truth will
17:06
be made known because you're right the
17:08
truth will make you free
17:11
amen
17:12
well let's get into the questions
17:14
there's a lot of wonderful questions you
17:15
guys are so all the viewers are so
17:17
creative in their questions reading
17:19
through them i'm like oh they're so good
17:21
and i like it i love it because when we
17:23
all come together and with our different
17:25
questions and ask them it taps into
17:27
different parts of us we haven't
17:29
yet it gives us revelation deeper
17:31
revelation when we come all together
17:33
so the first question i have um is from
17:36
me because
17:38
all the logic streams people were like
17:41
it's the benefit of being god with cat
17:42
you get to ask her your own questions
17:44
and i was like
17:47
when you're in the throne room and
17:49
there's the altar and the seven blazing
17:51
torches in front of the throne god says
17:53
he's an all-consuming fire his angels in
17:56
his word he says he makes him minister
17:58
he makes them ministers as flames of
18:00
fire
18:01
does like just on earth you know
18:03
sometimes when an angel comes in the
18:05
room how the side of your face and your
18:07
body can get really hot yes
18:10
is it the same way in the throne room do
18:12
you when they come and stand beside you
18:14
do you still feel that heat that
18:16
radiates off
18:19
you feel even more so i tell people
18:21
sometimes i feel like
18:23
not i don't want to think people think
18:25
i'm in pain
18:26
um
18:27
i don't mean it that way but i feel like
18:29
i could melt sometimes
18:31
it's so extreme but it's a different
18:33
kind of fire it's a different kind of
18:36
burning and most of it starts on the
18:39
inside of you before it gets to the
18:40
outside of you uh your spirit man now
18:44
when i'm taken to heaven i'm in my
18:45
spirit man i my body is not there i've
18:48
never been caught up in my body at all
18:51
it always stays behind my family's
18:53
evidence of that they'll come in to say
18:55
something to me and i just won't move i
18:57
won't respond
18:58
i'm not even breathing but i'm still
19:00
alive don't worry holy spirit just
19:02
climbs inside of me keeps my body alive
19:04
uh this is their plan this is the
19:06
trinity's plan to catch me up and show
19:07
me so they keep me while my spirit man
19:10
is in heaven but even my spirit man
19:13
feels like it's burning uh because of
19:15
the presence of and that burning is love
19:18
that's the highest level of fire is the
19:21
love
19:23
and yes it does come from the father now
19:25
i do want to say something
19:28
about the whole thing about the angels
19:30
it does say his angels causes ministers
19:32
to become flames of fire uh when you're
19:35
baptized in fire and this is also tied
19:37
into bapti baptism and fire the angelic
19:41
are part of that are part of the
19:43
invitations of the baptism and fire and
19:45
i mean holy spirit was the first one to
19:47
carry it down we know it came down here
19:50
we know in the book of acts they all
19:51
were hit and had flames on their heads
19:54
how would you love to do that people
19:56
yeah it was so consuming and i was in
19:59
israel and i was in the upper room and
20:01
when i walked in being a seer i saw the
20:04
portal the holy spirit opened when he
20:06
came in and brought the fire
20:08
and there is an open portal in the upper
20:10
room that has flames still around the
20:12
whole edges of that thing and that's
20:15
exactly where holy spirit came in and
20:16
brought the fire from heaven for the
20:18
first time and it was placed inside the
20:21
people to such a measure that it was on
20:23
them but fire is what makes you bold get
20:27
ready when that baptism and fire comes
20:29
it'll burn every care concern
20:32
every every fear you ever thought you
20:34
could ever have you won't even be
20:35
fearful after that you are so consumed
20:38
with with the living god and our god
20:41
yeah he is filled with fire let me tell
20:43
you and that's how the rainbows made
20:45
from him from the stones of fire that
20:47
abide inside the father and then the
20:50
glory uh it hits it and then the waves
20:52
of the rainbow come in and out of him
20:55
but no matter where you go in heaven you
20:57
will experience that same intensity uh
21:00
even more so when you're with jesus
21:02
himself his eyes when you look at his
21:04
eyes in heaven they look like flames of
21:06
fire it mentions that in the bible too
21:08
so people try to change things
21:11
scriptures that they don't understand
21:12
don't change anything people don't take
21:15
what's always been there those people
21:17
from the way past knew what they were
21:18
talking about they probably had
21:20
encounters their self uh when it says in
21:23
him we live we move we have our being
21:26
the prophets and poets of old
21:29
talked about those things
21:31
so actually when it says in him we live
21:33
we move we have our being that was
21:34
inside the father that's what the
21:36
scripture was talking about this
21:37
revelation we lived in him before you
21:40
were here okay you played on the stones
21:42
of fire you swim in the river of life
21:44
that comes from him
21:46
this is who you are
21:48
okay you're not just some weak person
21:50
trying to get by and stop saying you're
21:52
no sinner saved by grace you are filled
21:55
with the love of god you have no sins
21:57
anymore you're filled with his power
21:59
with his presence and his purposes in
22:02
the earth and the more you believe that
22:04
the more you believe something and
22:06
receive it the easier it is to get
22:08
things from god to understand things
22:09
from god
22:13
yeah that's amazing just even thinking
22:16
about
22:17
the
22:18
heat and the glory and the presence and
22:21
the consuming love of god it can
22:23
overwhelm you
22:25
in in your spirit here on earth also can
22:28
we go to the throne room whenever we
22:30
want to when we're in heaven or
22:33
how does that work
22:35
you can go anytime you want to and
22:37
there's no time in heaven i know when
22:40
sean bach arrived he was there for a
22:43
long time he didn't even care about
22:46
seeing his mansion when he first got
22:48
there he was so consumed
22:50
with love from the father and from the
22:52
son many times when i was caught up
22:55
there to the throne room he was john
22:57
park was still in the throne
23:00
he's left now uh to go see all of his
23:03
things that that the lord prepared for
23:05
him
23:06
but um it's such a powerful place yes
23:09
you can come you can come whenever you
23:11
want to everyone who goes to heaven
23:14
you're there by the grace of god but
23:16
because you repented right you don't get
23:18
any holier in heaven so if god if you
23:22
repented of your sins and you're in
23:24
heaven there's nothing to keep you from
23:26
going to the throne room ever you can go
23:28
there and be in his presence you're
23:29
there with sometimes masses of people
23:31
celebrating
23:32
um sometimes they're dancing sometimes
23:34
the father sharing revelation with them
23:37
sometimes you sit in these huge circles
23:39
around the throne
23:41
uh the throne is round so this makes
23:43
sense to me there's four sets of steps
23:46
going up to the throne so no matter what
23:47
side you're on you can still run up
23:49
there it is high and lifted up it's not
23:51
like you're gonna walk up three feet and
23:53
be there be there but all the way up
23:55
you're having these encounters of his
23:57
presence all the way up to the the
23:59
throne where he's seated and his son is
24:01
next to him
24:03
hallelujah
24:04
oh i can't wait oh my spirit gets all
24:07
excited like paul talks about you know
24:09
we long for that
24:10
time with him uh so a question that many
24:14
people have asked is uh steve last week
24:17
kat you mentioned advice um that she
24:20
gave you i guess you gave steve advice
24:22
to help with sleeping and could pat
24:25
explain
24:26
more about the rest of god and what
24:28
people can declare to help them sleep
24:32
yes
24:32
it does mention in the bible and people
24:34
go why don't you give references because
24:36
i want you to look it up
24:39
i mean you should look up i mean you can
24:41
search for
24:42
like the love of god or the rest of the
24:44
lord it depends of course on the
24:45
translations i'm sure that if you look
24:48
at the king james you're probably going
24:50
to find it in there for sure because
24:51
they don't change things i mean they
24:52
didn't change a lot of stuff
24:54
and i know people didn't like you know
24:56
the the way that the wording was and
24:58
stuff like that like
25:00
i guess an old english style type thing
25:02
but let me tell you if it's a unicorn
25:05
they called it the unicorn people in the
25:07
bible in the king james version and it's
25:09
one of my favorite i read many versions
25:11
but that's one of my favorites because
25:13
they didn't change those words so it
25:15
talks about the rest of the lord and um
25:18
i know people who've experienced that i
25:20
use jesse to plant us all the time
25:22
because he talked about it he had been
25:24
ministering everywhere for and he still
25:26
does wow jesse's still out there doing
25:29
it and that jesse duplantis is hilarious
25:32
he lived a very strange unusual life
25:35
growing up
25:36
didn't know god or anything and had an
25:38
encounter i mean he had an encounter and
25:40
uh but he had a praying mama and let me
25:43
tell you what she didn't let go of him
25:44
so all you praying moms keep it up
25:46
so anyway he was traveling he was very
25:49
getting weary and he checked into his
25:51
hotel room and he's supposed to be at
25:53
the meeting place and he never showed up
25:57
he came the next day and told people
25:58
what happened he had he had been plowing
26:01
and out there working and ministering
26:02
and and the holy spirit would you know
26:05
impress him you need to rest you need to
26:06
rest and i guess heaven got tired of him
26:09
not resting
26:10
he was in his room and an angel appeared
26:13
in jesse's room
26:15
and he came up and he either touched him
26:17
or put his hand over him he said the
26:19
rest of the lord upon you and he fell
26:21
backwards on his bed and slept like 20
26:24
hours
26:25
oh my gosh that's awesome
26:28
it really does work it does work and you
26:31
declare it you can even say i declare i
26:33
won't say i'm not i'm not saying this
26:35
over me now i'm just explaining holy
26:37
spirit okay he's my best friend he's
26:39
quite a character and uh but if i was
26:42
gonna say that if i travel travel travel
26:44
and i've got so much going on here right
26:46
here where i'm at you know when your
26:48
studio is in your home it's one thing
26:49
but when your offices are in your home
26:52
you really like it work all the time and
26:55
since i'm up all the time it's never
26:56
ending stuff that i have to do plan uh
26:59
draw
27:00
a
27:01
schedule a revelation to write down
27:05
it's like it's it's never ending and i'm
27:07
okay with that but sometimes i get
27:09
really tired every now and then i'll
27:10
just say that myself though the rest of
27:12
the lord upon you man i'm out and i'll
27:14
sleep like 14 hours
27:16
[Laughter]
27:18
that's awesome it is not just to say it
27:20
is actually a thing a thing that you can
27:23
ask for and declare over and just get
27:25
ready to be in a place where you're
27:26
going to go to sleep
27:28
[Laughter]
27:30
okay so i know paul was asking this
27:32
behind the scenes earlier uh for you
27:35
know can you have her explain that so
27:37
that's going to help a lot of people so
27:39
just declare that over yourself before
27:40
you sleep right just to clear it
27:42
obviously not while you're driving
27:44
[Laughter]
27:46
while you're in your bed ready
27:49
no not while you're on a plane they may
27:50
have to wake you up or carry you out
27:54
be wise with your declarations yes be
27:57
wise
27:58
okay whatsoever you say that's one of
28:00
those things you'll have what's whoever
28:02
you say so
28:04
laura wants to know can you ask cat if
28:07
the movies that artists make in heaven
28:10
have any influence on filmmakers here on
28:14
earth
28:17
i think um
28:19
i don't quite know how to answer that um
28:24
there are people and i know you're
28:26
probably not talking about this but when
28:27
people who do that for a living they
28:30
make it to heaven yay
28:32
that's what they'll be doing in heaven
28:33
it's their gift and they have all
28:37
types of new
28:39
um
28:40
material and understanding and
28:42
revelation uh for making the movies in
28:45
heaven but the whole uh plan of god
28:49
is to tell stories that's what jesus did
28:52
when he was on the earth he told stories
28:53
all the time
28:54
the father still does it in the throne
28:56
room they love that they love to tell
28:59
stories of visional things and have
29:01
things uh you know explanation to see
29:03
images or share things
29:05
and uh god is definitely for movies and
29:08
heaven they don't have to have ratings
29:09
allow that because when people think
29:11
well depending on what they go and see
29:14
i hope you're not seeing the other kind
29:15
of stuff
29:16
what goes in your soul what you watch
29:18
with your eyes is going to go in your
29:20
soul and some things you don't ever want
29:22
to let in your soul but the movies in
29:24
heaven are intense exciting they're
29:26
funny
29:28
they're beautiful
29:30
and i do have to say this there are
29:32
images set on purpose from heaven
29:35
down into the mind of scriptwriters
29:38
screenwriters producers
29:40
uh i don't know how many people say i
29:42
have this great idea for a movie you
29:44
know i hope one day somebody makes a
29:46
movie about this i i hear that almost
29:48
all the time
29:49
i am writing scripts myself
29:52
and
29:53
which is going to be pretty powerful now
29:54
that's the commission to do that but yes
29:56
there are things in heaven that happen
29:59
the way they do things things that are
30:01
are living there or architecture that's
30:03
there it definitely is on purpose
30:06
dropped down into the mind
30:08
of people who are creative on the earth
30:10
so that they can produce those things
30:12
like that whether it by doing those
30:14
images or words they put with those
30:16
images is is kind of up to what's in the
30:18
soul of the person making the movies but
30:22
the movie the home movie industry is
30:24
definitely has available to them
30:26
revelation being sent on purpose so that
30:29
people will know different things even
30:32
some of the things you see in some of
30:33
the sci-fi movies
30:35
like star wars and other things i
30:37
literally see
30:38
some of the way things happen or images
30:41
i've seen literally
30:42
in heaven i see them in some of the star
30:45
wars movies it's really really powerful
30:47
when that happens
30:49
wow that must be so cool for you you're
30:51
probably like oh that's from heaven like
30:53
i could imagine watching it oh that's
30:55
what happened
30:57
jen hears it all the time we're usually
30:58
the ones who go check out movies you
31:00
know if they're like g maybe pg i don't
31:03
think we see much anything beyond that
31:06
uh all of our movies most all of our
31:08
movies will be g or pg but there won't
31:10
be anything
31:11
no i'll just give you heavens uh code
31:14
for raiding in movies uh if a movie is a
31:17
g on the earth the the angels in heaven
31:20
will say well it's it's good most of the
31:22
way or if it's pg s is partly good some
31:26
of the time pg-13 it's only good 13 of
31:30
the time
31:41
i heard you also say one time when you
31:43
do go into a movie um that's
31:47
wrong or bad or
31:49
violent or that the demonic realm i mean
31:52
they
31:54
vomit
31:55
on your head as you walk into the
31:57
theater is that that
31:59
shocked me but my spirit resonated that
32:02
at such truth
32:04
well they mark you
32:06
they have to have a way to mark you
32:08
two reasons number one so they can
32:10
pursue dragging you into deeper stuff
32:13
okay because you can't wash these marks
32:14
off unless it's something you repent for
32:18
i would encourage people do not see
32:20
anything that's got graphic violence
32:23
profanity
32:24
sexuality
32:26
or witchcraft which crafts a big one a
32:28
lot of people like that type of thing
32:30
now there's a big difference in safe
32:32
fantasy
32:34
like you know um
32:36
i know the narnia movies are really
32:37
powerful
32:39
especially the first three
32:41
you can tell i've been talking a lot
32:43
that's okay
32:45
but it's very important that you
32:47
understand
32:48
that what you enter into
32:51
this is how holy spirit says they're so
32:53
simple in heaven when they explain
32:54
something whatever you enter into will
32:56
enter into you
32:57
now i'm not saying that you'll get
32:59
possessed by things but things will
33:01
attach themselves to you or follow you
33:05
i need my hot chocolate jen
33:08
i didn't get to have my hot chocolate
33:09
yet people that's like my coffee
33:12
and um so anyway um being a seer that
33:15
was one of the first things i noticed uh
33:17
when i started going to movies i go down
33:20
the hallway well i never go into any of
33:22
the bad ones and usually you can check
33:23
them out online to see what's actually
33:25
in the movie
33:27
and uh they've been really not good in
33:29
this last year maybe the last two years
33:32
but especially the last year even some
33:34
of the things on television even in the
33:36
commercials they've stuck in a lot of
33:38
things that are indecent
33:40
or uh or outright witchcraft stuff and
33:43
i'm talking about just regular tv and
33:45
the commercials you got to make sure you
33:46
know what's going on and what's coming
33:47
on your screen
33:49
but i walked in and i saw these ledges
33:52
and i see both sides all the time i see
33:55
the dark and i see the the operations of
33:57
the host of the angelic
33:59
and of the darkness and they had demons
34:02
sitting on a ledge it's a spiritual
34:04
ledge you're not going to go into
34:05
theater and see unless you're a seer and
34:07
they were waiting and whoever went in
34:09
that r-rated movie got vomited on
34:14
it's like a green slime when they came
34:16
out it was still on there walking down
34:17
the hallway still down there so no
34:19
matter what you think you're doing and
34:20
nobody knows somebody knows the whole
34:23
spirit realm knows that you've gone into
34:25
something that you shouldn't have seen
34:27
with your eyes
34:28
or heard or uh or
34:30
listened the actions that are going on
34:32
in that thing there's a reason why they
34:34
make it restricted is what they say r is
34:37
for remember heaven says it's rotten and
34:39
so i will sometimes walk in to the
34:42
theater as i'm going to my theater
34:45
probably at the end
34:47
you know the decent fun movie i like
34:49
funny movies a decent one and um
34:52
and i'll see these things i'll walk up
34:54
i'll get almost next to them i'll go
34:58
i evict you in jesus name
35:01
and they almost vomit on themselves
35:03
because
35:05
they don't know i can see them unless i
35:07
say something
35:09
and just like well i had a question
35:11
asked is satan know everything you think
35:13
no he knows what thoughts he puts in you
35:16
and he knows that you received it by the
35:17
response you give to the thoughts he's
35:20
given you but he's not omnipresent he's
35:22
not omniscient on this and he doesn't
35:24
know everything all at the same time
35:25
which is another reason why they mark
35:27
you
35:28
if you do something that's sinful or
35:30
against god they mark you because then
35:33
uh they know who to pursue because satan
35:35
doesn't know everything and then he'll
35:37
send or assign sometimes them to you to
35:40
get you uh to go into deeper areas of
35:43
darkness and so if you've done things
35:45
like that make sure your pencils wiped
35:47
off
35:49
hello people they have a whole system in
35:51
the spirit realm that we don't have here
35:54
and because you can't see
35:56
and you think that god's okay with it
35:58
because he said hasn't said anything to
35:59
you no he lives by his own word you know
36:03
what's right what's wrong if you just
36:05
read the word of god and usually inside
36:08
your spirit man if it has a red flag
36:10
about something then don't be a part of
36:12
it don't just go with your friends
36:14
because they want to go see a seance or
36:15
they want to go see something
36:17
like that whole thing they had happened
36:19
that was like made up to satan that big
36:21
event they had recently
36:23
and i think people died in there and
36:26
nobody should go into anything like that
36:28
i think this is just a fun thing around
36:31
you know the fake holiday halloween uh
36:33
around that time they have a lot of
36:35
these things that people think well this
36:36
is special this is different
36:38
that is not a fantasy okay evil
36:41
wicked spiritual stuff is not a fantasy
36:44
it is a reality and you want to be
36:46
careful what you enter into you don't
36:48
want to take things home with you or
36:50
even be in your home
36:53
this is the reality of the spirit realm
36:55
however when you're out doing things for
36:57
god you help people you love people
37:00
god also writes your name in the book he
37:02
don't necessarily put a mark on you but
37:04
he put your name in the book they helped
37:05
this person this day they gave this
37:07
money to the homeless person they helped
37:08
them find a place to stay they were kind
37:10
to this person whose heart was broken uh
37:13
he he makes a book of remembrance that
37:15
he will then bless you from
37:17
so either side
37:19
somehow is making notes okay
37:23
and all of that just from that one
37:24
question about the movie theater but
37:26
that's true anywhere i go i see hell's
37:28
activity everywhere uh las vegas is one
37:32
of the worst places and he had me go
37:34
there i went there and spoke and i'm
37:36
telling you what
37:38
one day one day that will be a region of
37:40
light god's taken las vegas not because
37:43
he wants it because he marked it for
37:45
himself a long time ago
37:47
places that are marked by god for his
37:49
purpose as the enemy on purpose
37:51
wants to try to defile them one day it
37:54
will be called the city of his son
37:57
las vegas will not be called the city of
37:59
sin because the city of his son
38:02
and that while i was there i had a lot
38:03
of encounters but i saw the demonic
38:06
following people into places where they
38:08
shouldn't be going and i would just tell
38:10
you if they try to hand you a pack on
38:12
the street corner las vegas don't take
38:14
it don't take it it usually has an x on
38:17
it you don't want that thing because
38:18
evil spirits go with every packet that
38:20
was given one went with that person who
38:22
took that packet
38:23
wow that's so powerful your life goes on
38:27
in this world you think this is all
38:28
there is and you're wrong this is all
38:30
temporary what you're seeing with your
38:32
natural eyes is temporary the unseen
38:35
realm is what made the the same things
38:38
okay
38:39
god made them it says all that you see
38:41
was made by the unseen realm in the
38:43
unseen realm are both sides until the
38:45
day everything is ended and all the evil
38:48
wickedness is put away into the lake of
38:51
fire which will happen a long way down
38:53
the road so don't look for that to
38:55
happen but until then you keep your
38:57
guard up it says guard your heart that's
38:59
your soul for out of it will be the way
39:01
you live your life is the truest
39:03
scripture in the bible except for being
39:05
born again
39:06
and so yeah my life is not different i
39:09
go to the mall i see all this activity
39:11
from both sides going on
39:13
and uh i have learned to train my eyes
39:16
to stay where god wants them unless he
39:18
wants me to go up and say something to
39:19
somebody which sometimes he does have me
39:21
say something
39:23
and i love the holy spirit because the
39:25
holy spirit's not scared to go into the
39:28
dark places no he's not and he's not
39:31
scared to bring the light of christ into
39:34
the places we would say oh that's you
39:36
know i i love that about him because he
39:39
he's not held back by anything he he
39:43
will go and reach the lost where he
39:44
needs to go and infiltrate yeah and all
39:47
that you just shared has i know opened i
39:50
i feel it in the spirit that a lot of
39:52
people are
39:53
they're feeling they're repenting for
39:55
things they've they've seen or done but
39:57
this is the truth this truth needs to
39:59
get out because it's going to help you
40:01
progress with your walk with god get
40:02
closer to the heart of god yeah the
40:05
whole point of the enemy the enemy satan
40:07
he is our number one enemy of satan
40:09
because he's really in charge of the
40:12
wrongs being done now
40:14
uh
40:14
he can't create anything good
40:17
there's nothing good that comes out from
40:19
from hell or from the devil and the ones
40:21
trying to control our country they are
40:23
actually cannot control good they can't
40:27
they cannot create anything good because
40:29
it isn't in them okay that's why we're
40:32
trying to let you know don't go further
40:33
or chase the darkness because you'll end
40:35
up by getting gray on the inside of you
40:37
if you looked at you i would see gray
40:39
light
40:40
okay get it out evict it from your soul
40:43
just repent for things you probably
40:44
shouldn't have said or gone to or read
40:47
but you're right about the holy spirit
40:49
he is a bold and he's about to touch all
40:52
flesh in this earth and boy is that
40:54
going to be something that's going to
40:55
happen when that goes on but no
40:57
sometimes you let me walk up to somebody
40:59
you know and i don't like the fact that
41:00
people think every tattooed pierced
41:02
person is wicked that's not true either
41:04
some have markings from god god assigned
41:06
them to have that done that might not be
41:08
the norm but you can't put everybody in
41:10
a box you just can't do that and we are
41:13
to love everybody no matter who they are
41:15
if nothing else i will send the life of
41:17
god into buildings that i know are
41:19
filled with things that they're doing
41:20
wrong i'll send the fire of god the love
41:23
of god to bring freedom uh to the people
41:25
who are there there are people praying
41:27
for those people and your prayers are
41:29
powerful because holy spirit can go the
41:31
angelic can go even it's not somewhere
41:34
where you'd normally see somebody like
41:35
sharing the truth or something like that
41:37
i send it into all of those places i
41:40
pray for the souls of the people either
41:42
doing those acts or or or you know
41:44
bringing them so people can be a part of
41:46
them i'm always careful to make sure
41:49
that there is hope for people's souls
41:53
amen beautiful and i'm going to skip to
41:55
a question because someone asked about
41:58
um
41:59
about being marked let me find that
42:02
question
42:03
um okay so
42:05
um
42:06
teresa asked or tressa asked in
42:09
ephesians 1 13 it says you were marked
42:12
in him with a seal
42:14
is this a literal seal that we can see
42:17
in heaven and do you do you want me to
42:19
read ephesians 1 13 and 14
42:22
um
42:23
which which which translation is it yeah
42:26
let me let me read i think i'm reading
42:28
out of um new king james
42:30
in him you also trusted after you heard
42:33
the word of truth the gospel of your
42:36
salvation in whom also having believed
42:39
you were sealed with the holy spirit of
42:42
promise who is the guarantee of our
42:44
inheritance until the redemption of the
42:47
purchased possession to the praise of
42:49
his glory so she's asking it says there
42:53
you are marked in him with the seal is
42:55
that a literal seal that we can see in
42:58
heaven
42:59
i um that mark has to do with the holy
43:03
spirit
43:04
um
43:06
when you're born again of course once
43:07
you're born again you then have the
43:09
promise of the holy spirit coming no one
43:12
can keep him from you it really is
43:14
talking more about the holy spirit at
43:16
that point
43:17
that's why christ sent him and he even
43:19
said
43:20
jesus said i have to go but i will send
43:23
the one who comes after me uh you know
43:26
and the holy spirit does so many things
43:28
for us i'm glad you even you that you
43:29
brought him up but the holy spirit will
43:31
begin to pursue people especially who
43:34
have that seal it's a seal of his blood
43:37
that's what that seal is when you get to
43:39
heaven is something you literally can
43:40
see
43:41
when you are born again is one of the
43:43
most powerful things in the spirit that
43:45
ever happens on this earth many things
43:47
happen in heaven when you're receiving
43:49
christ uh the father comes and takes the
43:52
stone of fire from himself and places it
43:54
in your spirit and then your spirit man
43:56
has light on the inside uh jesus gives
43:59
you a deposit of the anointing he walks
44:01
in that's first john 2 27 if you want
44:03
the scripture
44:04
many things happen that you're not aware
44:06
of and most pastors don't even know
44:08
these things are happening they do know
44:10
your name is written in the lamb's book
44:12
of life and that that seals you for
44:14
eternity
44:15
uh another promises given to you is
44:18
eternal life um everybody everybody it
44:21
will live forever it depends on you
44:23
choose where you're going to live you're
44:24
going to live in uh you know in heaven
44:26
now and then on the new earth with the
44:28
lord or will you live forever with the
44:30
enemy in eventually the lake of fire but
44:34
that seal is two things
44:36
it is a seal with the promise of the
44:38
holy spirit coming to come and abide in
44:41
you which now is available to you before
44:43
it wasn't you cannot have holy spirit
44:46
dwell in an unclean person so what that
44:49
mainly was talking about was you the
44:51
seal the promise of the holy spirit now
44:54
being allowed to enter into you and what
44:57
he does is when you get born again holy
45:00
spirit will come alongside you
45:03
he will come immediately and come
45:05
alongside you the bible talks about that
45:07
but when you and ask and invite him to
45:10
indwell you
45:12
there's an opening made from that seal
45:15
the holy spirit knows it and understands
45:17
it and he can enter into you so this is
45:20
a lot of deep stuff for some people but
45:22
they do they do have marks there's two
45:25
other marks you get too
45:27
one is the name
45:30
the name of your god in the palm of your
45:32
hand
45:33
and the name of the city of your god in
45:35
your forehead and for all those who
45:37
understand about end time stuff you know
45:40
that in the last days when the
45:42
antichrist is on the earth that's
45:43
several hundred years from now people uh
45:45
certainly look he's not on the earth
45:47
right now but when he comes uh he will
45:50
want to mark people with a mark in the
45:52
palm of their hand and in their forehead
45:54
and that is why
45:56
he knows that god does that it's like
45:58
mocking god so you are marked with those
46:01
visible marks and in heaven you can see
46:03
these visible marks it's it's really
46:05
it's it's written not in a known
46:07
language but you'll get a mark right
46:09
here that's the name of your god okay
46:11
that's jesus christ and up here is the
46:14
name of the city of your god that those
46:16
are marks so you are marked in in those
46:19
ways but the seal of the promise is for
46:22
holy spirit then
46:24
having permission to come alongside you
46:27
when you're born again and then the most
46:29
important thing you'll do besides
46:30
getting born again is invite the holy
46:32
spirit to indwell you and then he goes
46:34
from here to living in you and i know
46:37
holy spirit is an unlimited layered
46:40
being which is why he's everywhere all
46:42
at the same time but you don't get a
46:44
little part of him you get a whole of
46:46
him living in you and then your life
46:49
really begins to change i hope that
46:52
helped
46:52
hallelujah and that answer is
46:55
cassandra's question too because she
46:57
asked is there anything similar to
46:59
tattoos in heaven
47:04
what is is there anything similar to
47:07
tattoos in heaven
47:10
yeah there are and i want you to know
47:12
people that god was the first one to
47:14
mark
47:15
uh satan steals everything we actually
47:18
have not that i'm selling but i'm
47:20
letting you know one of those powerful
47:22
revelations on the cd
47:25
uh is called copycat
47:27
and it shares everything in the
47:30
scriptures and things that's on heaven
47:32
that satan when he came to the earth
47:34
wants to defile it and take it for
47:36
himself
47:37
marking doesn't actually belong to satan
47:40
it belongs to god he marked you know um
47:43
remember he marked cain in the garden
47:45
remember that he put a mark on him
47:47
people would see so they wouldn't kill
47:49
him he's going to mark 144 000 uh jews
47:52
uh in the last days a mark you visibly
47:55
can see
47:56
um there are other times in the bible or
47:58
talked about people god putting a mark
48:00
on them uh that's god god marx that's
48:04
his part of his m.o
48:06
and satan to insult him
48:09
would get people to put satan would get
48:11
people to put his marks on them and so
48:14
there's i've seen people with both like
48:17
they used to have the one kind but they
48:18
got born again and they had marks of god
48:21
i happen to know that my own daughter
48:23
god told her to put um
48:27
she has lightning bolts on her
48:30
he told her put brass knuckles on her
48:32
feet and i don't mean little ones i mean
48:34
brass knuckles because she dances for
48:37
him it's his gift and god said you wore
48:40
in the spirit when you dance therefore
48:42
you will have
48:43
these uh brass knuckles on your feet
48:46
that's from god that was something god
48:48
requested of her she didn't even
48:49
hesitate to do it she told me after she
48:52
did it and as she's telling me the holy
48:54
spirit said that was that was a command
48:56
from god for her to do that to represent
48:59
what she is for him
49:01
i know other people who god has said i
49:03
want these marks of my marks
49:05
representing me put on you and that's
49:07
going to begin to increase and i will
49:09
say this if you're not if you're not an
49:11
adult yet make sure you let your parents
49:14
know or discuss it with your parents in
49:16
many way until you be commented an adult
49:19
and make sure you're hearing the right
49:21
thing but there are many powerful things
49:23
lightning bolts belong to god the fire
49:25
all belongs to god and we know that um
49:29
one of the images of course that
49:30
represents hell is skulls
49:32
people go well that's your that's your
49:34
skeleton yeah but most people don't put
49:36
it on them because it represents it's
49:37
supposed to represent death and we know
49:40
that god says this day i let you choose
49:42
choose life or death
49:45
you if you have decided if you are an
49:47
adult and you want to put a mark on you
49:49
i would make sure it's something that
49:51
portrays the image of god
49:53
and not hell okay
49:56
and if you can get them changed i will
49:58
say this there's going to be a move of
49:59
god one day on this earth that will
50:02
actually erase many of the wicked
50:04
tattoos this is for believers
50:07
many of the wicked tattoos put on them
50:09
that they had put on them in in one of
50:11
these moves of god coming that will be
50:13
wiped off of them
50:15
i've heard testimonies of ministers
50:17
praying for people
50:19
with tattoos that they had before they
50:21
were born again with gang affiliation
50:23
and stuff and the lord removed it
50:25
supernaturally yes
50:27
that is
50:29
that's what you're talking about that's
50:30
amazing that's right supernaturally just
50:33
gone you know praise god
50:35
don't have to go through the pain that's
50:37
right you don't have to go through the
50:38
pain amen
50:40
um kel ass in proverbs 8 um calls wisdom
50:46
a she
50:47
and her
50:48
what does this mean is wisdom a woman
50:51
and i'm just going to read proverbs um 8
50:54
1-3 out of new living translation
50:57
listen as wisdom calls out
51:00
here as understanding raises her voice
51:03
on the hilltop along the road she takes
51:06
her stand at the crossroads by the gates
51:09
at the entrance to the town on the road
51:12
leading in she cries out loud so kel
51:15
wants to know um
51:16
is wisdom a woman
51:19
um it's not it's not a woman you
51:22
wouldn't call uh any an angel a male or
51:25
female you wouldn't call them that they
51:27
have the appearance of them but a spirit
51:31
is not man or woman okay so i know she
51:34
didn't understand this i'll let you know
51:36
yes it looks like a female it is
51:39
feminine appearance in every single way
51:41
her voice
51:43
uh she is a spiritual being is the
51:45
proper way to say that she is a
51:47
spiritual being in heaven uh and of
51:50
course she's sent down here to the earth
51:51
sometimes to bring wisdom to people
51:54
um it is always a good thing to ask for
51:56
sound wisdom if you want to ask god for
51:58
something
52:00
there's many things you can ask him for
52:01
you know like extreme discernment don't
52:03
do that unless you're ready to have
52:04
things revealed
52:06
but sound wisdom is a good thing but
52:08
wisdom is a feminine spirit she looks
52:12
beautiful and i've seen her in heaven
52:14
i've seen her on the earth and i don't
52:17
know why some people think everything
52:19
has to look like a male
52:21
if the father can be both okay the
52:24
father can be uh
52:26
and
52:27
have um
52:28
you know what that's why god said let's
52:30
make man in our image right let's make
52:33
man in our image and after our likeness
52:35
is how they operate and then he said and
52:37
we will make them male and female and
52:40
there's a reason why he made them male
52:42
and female so that we would when
52:44
whenever we would be married we would
52:45
have a way to have be connected together
52:48
we would create soul ties together but
52:50
there are many feminine spiritual beings
52:53
in heaven and i want to go back to the
52:55
seven tortures you talked about
52:58
uh those flames those torches are seven
53:00
spiritual beings
53:03
they serve the father i've seen them um
53:06
the flames never go out but they'll step
53:08
out of that there's seven spiritual
53:10
beings that serve the father himself uh
53:13
they they belong to him
53:15
and uh and always have belonged to him
53:17
so things are represented in different
53:19
images in heaven but those seven flames
53:22
of those churches before the throne are
53:24
seven spiritual beings that serve the
53:26
father
53:27
continually the same thing is spirit the
53:31
wisdom is a feminine spirit
53:33
she can go in and out of the father to
53:35
get directions from him or instructions
53:37
from him or even impartations that she
53:40
brings to the earth sometimes and will
53:41
walk through somebody and leave it
53:43
inside that person
53:45
so
53:46
we need desperately in the body of
53:48
christ to have spirit around boot camp
53:52
we need a greater understanding of what
53:53
the spirit realm is and how that
53:55
operates why did god make it well it
53:58
always has existed actually that's where
54:00
he's always existed in but but there are
54:02
spiritual beings that look feminine
54:04
heaven there's some that take care of
54:06
the forest the streams i've seen them
54:09
they're very beautiful looking they have
54:11
beautiful song when they sing in places
54:14
in heaven
54:15
so some of the seraphim
54:18
they live in the glory cloud over the
54:20
throne they some of them look feminine
54:22
some look masculine i mean you know
54:24
their their faces and whatever but they
54:26
have hair that looks like looks like
54:28
it's on fire and they'll dip down out of
54:31
the glory cloud over the throne and they
54:33
get more of the glory on them then they
54:35
go back up they never stop singing over
54:37
him
54:38
so yeah spirit uh the spirit of wisdom
54:41
is a spiritual being and she does look
54:45
feminine
54:46
that's that's amazing thank you for that
54:48
revelation even about the seven spirits
54:50
of god that's that's awesome
54:53
don asks cat has said that the hosts
54:55
have their own language does their
54:58
language sound tribal almost like native
55:01
american languages
55:04
um i wouldn't say it sounds tribal it's
55:07
uh
55:08
if they're talking to each other i don't
55:09
necessarily understand but of course
55:11
they can they speak in english to me
55:13
when they speak they use the language
55:15
that i understand and know
55:17
um
55:18
i would say the tribe part is right uh
55:21
they got that down and
55:23
the native american tribes were not the
55:26
first tribes okay
55:28
the jewish tribes
55:30
were around that's why they made tribes
55:32
that's why the father made tribes right
55:34
the 12 tribes of israel remember that
55:37
that's because in heaven when he made
55:39
the the host and when he made the angels
55:42
they were made in tribes
55:44
like there's a whole like the royal
55:46
guard let's use them this very very
55:48
extremely high level of dominion
55:50
authority and power
55:52
are the royal guard they all look like
55:54
lions that doesn't mean they walk on all
55:56
fours
55:57
their faces look very similar to lions
56:01
is just what he decided to choose them
56:03
but there's tribes there's tribes of the
56:05
royal guard and they all look very
56:08
similar i mean you can identify them in
56:10
heaven you know they're from this tribe
56:11
of the host or this tribe of
56:14
their scouts those are tribes um
56:16
there's um i'm trying to think of some
56:18
of the other ones but there they have a
56:20
title like a title of the tribe they're
56:23
a part of that is what they're sent for
56:25
that's what they were designed for
56:27
some are couriers there's a on the
56:29
angelic side that's under gabriel
56:31
there's there's couriers there's scribes
56:34
there's worker angels there's ones who
56:36
deal in the body parts in the warehouse
56:38
all those are tribes created for gabriel
56:41
but the host is the army most of them
56:43
look like creatures but there's a whole
56:45
tribes of them so there's not just like
56:47
one of this one or one of that one
56:48
they're all individual ones they all
56:50
have personalities
56:52
uh so the tribe thing that part is right
56:56
but the the language that the host the
56:58
the host of heaven which are the armies
57:00
of heaven they understand the commands
57:02
they're the ones who take the commands
57:04
to go in war on our behalf
57:06
even did that and for israel back in the
57:09
ancient days uh as said in isaiah that
57:12
the captain of the host that would be
57:14
michael
57:15
went to the far ends of heaven and
57:18
gathered the army to fight on behalf of
57:20
israel
57:21
and i can tell you this i do know that
57:23
michael's headquarters in heaven is at
57:25
the the bottom it's a world because the
57:29
that's why the earth is round i'm always
57:31
going to say that the earth is not flat
57:33
heaven is not flat it's a world called
57:36
the father's house and at the top part
57:38
of this world is where the throne
57:40
excuse me the throne room is and all
57:42
that that stuff going on but at the
57:44
bottom part hidden in clouds of glory
57:46
dark glory a dark glory doesn't mean
57:49
it's black people it's if you took a
57:51
million peacock feathers because in
57:53
these clouds of glory that that will
57:57
will wrap around all of michael's
57:59
headquarters are millions of eyes those
58:02
are living eyes and they're even in
58:03
these clouds of glory that that will
58:06
cover and and protect because
58:08
heaven's army headquarters is not a
58:11
tourist attraction in heaven i keep
58:13
saying that you're invited to go there
58:16
in the throne room you don't have to be
58:17
invited but at heaven's at michael's
58:19
place you're going to have to be invited
58:21
to get to see that place and so god even
58:23
has diagrammed and laid out heaven
58:25
itself that world called heaven to have
58:28
specific things specific tribes of the
58:31
host or the angelic being involved with
58:33
it
58:34
he does have a way he plans things god
58:37
has a memo a mode of operations and he's
58:40
very uh specific and perfected in all
58:43
those ways
58:45
that's beautiful
58:47
and it's really amazing how he said
58:48
about all the eyes because the first
58:50
thing i thought of was the wheel within
58:52
the wheel
58:53
yeah and the the cherubim with all the
58:56
eyes so we see that in scripture about
58:58
about what you just said
59:01
and let's see i think this will be um
59:03
the last question
59:05
for today we're already an hour i can't
59:07
believe it um
59:08
so margaret asks do we have a new name
59:12
in heaven if so does everyone get the
59:15
memo about our new name
59:20
when you go to heaven this is when you
59:23
go to move there i don't i well i have i
59:26
have a little nickname the father gives
59:27
me i won't give that to anybody
59:29
but the father loves to name things he
59:33
loves even places in heaven have names
59:35
that he's given to them
59:37
uh that new name will be like a little
59:40
nickname which is something only he
59:42
calls you and only you and he will know
59:44
it and it actually says in the bible
59:46
that he'll write on a stone it says that
59:48
in the bible that's not a river rock
59:51
it is a white diamond and he will write
59:54
that name and he will give it to you and
59:56
you and he will know that name it's not
59:58
going to be something that's going to be
60:00
passed on have you not going to run tell
60:01
your friend oh this is my name the
60:02
father gave this
60:04
it isn't like that um
60:06
your own friends will probably call you
60:07
the same nickname they did on the earth
60:08
by the way well unless it wasn't nice
60:10
and they'll pick a new one
60:12
but the new name you get in heaven is
60:15
something special that the father
60:17
chooses to call you and yes he is going
60:19
to personally give you that that white
60:21
diamond that stone
60:23
whenever it says stone in heaven is
60:25
talking about gemstones he will write
60:27
that on there and give it to you and
60:28
that's probably what he will call you uh
60:31
whenever you come to meet with his per
60:32
him personally or something
60:34
and uh yeah he likes to personalize
60:37
everything so you will get a new name
60:39
it won't be some big o drawn out name
60:42
that you can't remember or understand
60:44
it'd be something precious from the love
60:46
of god to your heart that's what it will
60:48
be
60:50

going on by
65:17
what everyone else is saying on the left
65:19
are those who don't know anything at all
65:20
pray for those people
65:22
but this is a time of excitement
65:25
in heaven there's such an excitement
65:27
coming from there every time i go now
65:29
there's so much excitement in the air of
65:31
things that are about to happen and and
65:33
just flow over this earth it's not the
65:36
rapture okay i know people say i'm wrong
65:39
but guess what there's they said that 10
65:40
years ago 20 years ago and and i don't
65:43
argue about who's right or wrong i know
65:44
god has a timetable in heaven he has his
65:47
own uh
65:49
timeline and we're not even anywhere
65:51
near close to the very end
65:54
he expects all the things he promised
65:56
his son that we would walk in before the
65:59
end comes the world will know us as
66:02
believers
66:03
because of our love for each other
66:05

66:24
around you

66:28
presence of all the enemies around us
66:31
and bless you abundantly do people think
66:34

01:44

01:46
something weird well okay i'll just say
01:48
this happy wednesday february 2 2022.
01:51
uh it's nice to be back as i have to be
01:53
back and alive
01:55
uh minus uh 10 pounds since you all saw
01:58
me last i got knocked down on the back
02:00
side and uh i'm just coming back but i
02:03
appreciate you all i know thousands of
02:05
you've been praying and sending notes
02:07
and we i really really appreciate that
02:10
drea and i both got this thing bad
02:12
um
02:13
i suppose it was the variant that people
02:15
talk about
02:17
because you know i never lost my sense
02:18
of taste or smell like some people talk
02:20
about so anyway thanks for supporting me
02:24
and
02:24
supporting the show and supporting
02:26
kelsey kelsey did a superb job kelsey
02:30
so i i do have an issue with talking
02:33
um
02:34
sometimes the coughing thing will just
02:36
decide to kick in there and so jeff is
02:38
ready that if for any reason something
02:40
happens and i can't
02:42
uh i can't stop the coughing then i'll
02:44
just call for him and say jeff you go
02:46
ahead and pick it up from here and then
02:48
he'll keep asking questions okay
02:50
so um i think with just to minimize
02:54
talking i think without further ado
02:55
let's bring in cat here
02:59
hello everybody
03:01
good to see you
03:02
cat it's good to see you thank you
03:06
steve and uh we're still playing energy
03:09
life strength wholeness in jesus name
03:11
right now we're not towering that attack
03:14
on your body we command the whole
03:16
servant again to pull down every spirit
03:17
of infirmity make that thing like dust
03:20
in jesus name
03:21
and the life of god to you this day yeah
03:24
oh i received that i totally received it
03:26
well cat well i'm as i told you before
03:28
the show i'm going to keep my questions
03:31
short so that i don't talk as much and
03:33
you
03:33
and um but let's jump right in uh well
03:36
let's before we jump into the questions
03:39
uh anything you want to say because
03:40
things have happened in the news since
03:42
you and i were
03:43
last on together anything you'd like to
03:45
say about current events a lot of things
03:48
have happened i'm very excited about the
03:51
convoys um yeah that
03:54
in both in canada and you know the one
03:56
here in america
03:58
it's showing this land
04:00
that we the free people
04:02
are not putting up with any more junk
04:05
garbage control or deception
04:07
i think it's probably the worst days the
04:10
left are the liberals no matter where
04:11
they're from canada or here i think it's
04:13
probably the worst days they've had so
04:15
far since this whole thing started
04:17
because even this late in the game it is
04:20
a game satan thinks he's playing but let
04:22
me tell you god is moving those
04:25
those things across the board and i can
04:27
tell you what i knew eventually that the
04:30
people would get fed up
04:32
and make a stand and that's what's
04:34
happening and that that should get you
04:36
so excited everyone out there should be
04:37
so excited that it's the people making
04:40
the stand
04:41
yes i know god's going to come in he is
04:43
going to do something amazing and
04:45
magnificent but how wonderful that
04:48
they're seeing that these people think
04:49
they've got us in controlling us they're
04:51
realizing they don't have us at all
04:54
and so i really want to uh thank thank
04:57
god right now for protection for those
04:59
convoys god i know that you have a
05:01
purpose in them thank you for all the
05:03
supply they need while they're out there
05:04
thank you for covering all of us because
05:07
they're carrying the supply for us but
05:09
they need to be supplied right now you
05:11
are with prayer
05:12
with protection
05:14
uh just with the life of god in all
05:16
those trucks
05:18
no accidents hold-ups delays or
05:20
breakdowns or attacks of any kind that's
05:22
what i'm declaring in jesus name so yes
05:24
it's making a stand like never before i
05:27
don't think this has happened in
05:28
probably years in this country i know
05:31
probably never in canada have the people
05:34
ever stood up like they are right now
05:35
saying we aren't taking this we're not
05:38
putting up with it they're believing god
05:40
that they'll even have a replacement in
05:42
the leadership there and i tell you they
05:44
will get it they will get what they're
05:46
asking for they're doing what's right
05:49
right now and so i'm fully supporting
05:52
the convoy that's going in canada i
05:54
think it's going from british columbia
05:56
all the way over to i can't remember i
05:58
think quebec i think it's where it's
05:59
headed uh but there's all kinds of
06:02
things this is the stuff about um the
06:04
wonderful thing about this is
06:06
no news media can keep people from
06:08
finding out what's happening because
06:10
everybody's sharing you everywhere
06:12
whether in canada or here um at home
06:15
if you didn't know it yes there's a
06:17
convoy
06:18
if they haven't left already it'll be
06:20
going from california all the way across
06:22
to dc
06:24
how about that put it in their face that
06:27
they're not going to tolerate this stuff
06:28
anymore that is a sure sign that that
06:31
foundation the evil has been standing on
06:33
is crumbling to nothing i'm quite sure a
06:36
lot of them are making different choices
06:38
like where can i run to or where can i
06:40
hide they're coming after us that's
06:42
probably what they think so i just want
06:44
you know i'm celebrating over this whole
06:46
thing but keep them in prayer and their
06:48
family members you know that god will
06:51
cover all of them and i'm just really
06:53
grateful and excited and i had told
06:55
people the very last of this last year
06:58
watched the first quarter of this year
07:02
2022 it's a powerful year but in 2022
07:06
more exposure and more patriotism and
07:09
the people standing up will happen than
07:11
this happened in all this time since
07:13
this whole thing started so this is a
07:15
sure sign that movement
07:18
towards righteousness justice and
07:19
freedom it's already started
07:22
yeah it's been so
07:24
gratifying i wish i hadn't been so sick
07:27
to enjoy those convoys more but you know
07:30
now i'm at the tail end of this thing
07:32
and it's such a gratifying thing to see
07:35
truckers i think there's like 50 000 or
07:38
maybe more than that trucks
07:40
and i mean the last time we talked about
07:42
convoys was back in the day when people
07:44
had see cb radios and ev there was a
07:47
song about
07:48
convoys and all that and that's all and
07:50
it was more of a fun thing you know uh
07:54
but now this is like deadly serious fun
07:57
but it is fun
07:58
i'm serious but let me tell you some of
08:00
the a couple things um
08:02
a couple things
08:04
every overpass that they have to drive
08:07
under these trucks in this whole journey
08:10
people have lined these overpasses so
08:12
that the truckers will see them and
08:14
they'll stand there even in the freezing
08:16
cold where it's cold uh they're bundled
08:18
up they've got signs they've got bull
08:20
horns they are cheering them on uh for
08:23
the freedom that they're they're helping
08:24
to take back for all of us
08:27
so even the truckers are being inspired
08:29
people are setting up camps wherever
08:32
these truckers stop and they've got food
08:34
prepared for them they've got things
08:36
that they need you know something if
08:38
they re
08:39
replacements wherever they need in their
08:40
in their vehicles or stuff done to them
08:43
and this is being done free out of love
08:46
for the stand that uh they're making
08:48
together is something the people coming
08:50
together which is one of the things
08:52
we've been praying all along so the
08:55
there's not it is the truckers but it's
08:57
also all these other people thousands of
08:59
them being involved as they go through
09:01
every state or every county or whatever
09:04
even in canada that the same thing is
09:06
happening and i do know this some
09:08
americans went up into canada to help
09:11
with this whole the canadian uh convoy
09:14
too and there's thousands of trucks
09:15
there but i'm pretty certain there's
09:17
over 50 000 right now
09:19
uh and and the the american ones i don't
09:22
even know where they're gonna they get
09:23
enough to join them they may line the
09:25
thing without even having to drive
09:27
anywhere because more and more people
09:29
are getting excited about it so yeah so
09:31
they're being having food hot food
09:33
prepared for them uh drinks to take with
09:36
them coffee and stuff like that coffee
09:37
stops
09:38
and so uh it is really a wonderful thing
09:41
you know and trudeau up there in canada
09:45
the the latest rumors are he supposedly
09:48
got the uh virus
09:51
to watch this coughing here um
09:54
but
09:56
it's also rumored that he didn't have
09:57
the virus at all he just went and hid
09:59
out because
10:00
he said they know we're coming for it
10:02
well we're not going to come for them
10:04
violence-wise i hope uh but they know
10:07
what we're coming for
10:10
we're coming for them but we're just not
10:12
going to hurt them but yeah i don't mind
10:14
if they
10:15
lock them up i really don't mind if they
10:18
lock them up what did they think what
10:20
did all these elites
10:22
not just in canada but australia
10:25
the us what did they think we were going
10:27
to do when they tried to take our
10:29
freedom away from us you know what did
10:31
they think this was going to turn out
10:33
like
10:36
i was i know it's supposed to not be
10:38
violent violent not liking the natural
10:40
uh violence right but the very number of
10:43
the people coming is so shocking
10:46
because you know so many have remained
10:48
silent they just remain silent and put
10:50
up with stuff that is going on but you
10:53
reach a limit if you're a free person in
10:55
free country there's just so much you're
10:57
gonna take
10:58
especially here in america we are
11:00
america the land is the free the brave
11:03
and the bold
11:05
and we know that this country is our
11:07
country we the people have this country
11:10
and a god lets us decide on things so
11:13
just because they decide they're going
11:14
to be a dictatorship it's not going to
11:16
last very long and i think that part has
11:18
ended as far as the people are concerned
11:21
and i think they're so shocked that the
11:24
number you know they've heard a few from
11:26
it they've tried to hide everybody
11:27
they've done their best to blot out our
11:29
voices or stop things from being heard
11:31
but you can't stop the action you cannot
11:34
stop you know fifty thousand trucks is
11:37
probably two or three uh people in each
11:39
truck
11:40
and all the people coming along to help
11:42
provide for them that is a massive site
11:45
and there's no way on god's earth can
11:48
these people hide that which is the most
11:49
terrifying thing they can't stop it they
11:53
can't do anything about it so they don't
11:55
know they don't know what's going to
11:56
happen which is the best part the people
11:58
who who are being they're they're being
12:00
shown that we're not putting up with
12:01
this anymore the leftist the liberals
12:04
they don't know what's going to happen
12:05
they just know something is started
12:07
that's not going to stop towards taking
12:09
our freedom i think that's the best part
12:12
yeah
12:13
so
12:14
where are they coming for
12:17
well let's see if you're ready to jump
12:18
into some other questions
12:20
um i'm going to try and keep them short
12:22
just because of this cuff so
12:24
you ready for the first one oh i'm ready
12:27
all right so and i think we've talked
12:29
about this one time months ago but the
12:32
question the viewers are asking is what
12:34
does god think about cremation is it
12:36
okay
12:40
i was just let me tell you first of all
12:43
the what the holy spirit told me when
12:45
the first time i was caught up to heaven
12:47
this was his statement please tell them
12:49
it's okay if they cremate uh they can
12:52
still put the ashes back together and
12:55
it's a lot cheaper and that's actually
12:57
what he said to tell people it's a lot
12:59
cheaper
13:00
you know what the ashes are even if you
13:02
sprinkle them somewhere
13:04
but i have to they're using that script
13:06
in the bible that says
13:08
i think it's in leviticus do not allow
13:10
yourself to be passed to the fire and
13:12
they make that one scripture
13:14
the whole law about no cremation
13:18
and yet back in the day most people uh
13:22
leaving all religious religion out or
13:24
whatever you want christianity out of
13:25
the whole scene
13:27
the way that one number one way that
13:29
they would dispose of the bodies was to
13:30
burn them because
13:32
number one they didn't know they don't
13:34
it was harder to dig in the ground
13:35
especially over if you've ever been in
13:37
the over in the mid east and places like
13:39
that it is not easy to dig anything in
13:42
that dirt there's so much stone and
13:44
stuff so a lot of them were
13:46
automatically going to be cremated with
13:48
just the number one way of choice um
13:51
just for um you know to keep things not
13:53
having dead bodies laying around and
13:55
things like that
13:56
make it sound like that but it was the
13:58
easiest and the safest way
14:01
to dispose of the bodies was that they
14:03
were cremated god does not care and let
14:07
me tell you people think well if i'm
14:08
cremated i won't have a body to be
14:10
resurrected
14:12
if he made you out of nothing and this
14:15
is the truth if he made you and
14:17
everything around you with nothing
14:20
he can totally get your body back
14:22
together every molecule every part of it
14:25
he knows what it is and i want to say
14:27
this if you think you're you're hurting
14:29
yourself by being cremated that god
14:31
doesn't want you to have a body you know
14:33
to bring back
14:34
what about the ones who were eaten by
14:36
sharks they were killed in an explosion
14:38
they were killed in a fire they're
14:40
they're you know they're pretty much
14:41
ashes and god wants you to know he can
14:44
put you back together this is not a a
14:47
spiritual ritual not like you know and
14:50
the side of the darkness it's not about
14:52
that back in the day in leviticus that
14:55
was a book of laws that's when a lot of
14:57
the laws were made because at that point
15:00
in mankind they needed them
15:02
some of them were doing something very
15:03
uh
15:04
not not good things wicked things evil
15:06
things and so that's why there was laws
15:09
laid down to follow and that that that
15:12
one made do not allow yourself to be
15:14
passed through the fire is not even
15:16
talking about cremation
15:18
whenever something like that comes up
15:19
especially in the
15:21
leviticus or one of those books that
15:24
talk about the ancient days you have to
15:26
look at the culture of the day
15:29
and what was going on
15:31
uh when they said don't like the best of
15:33
fire people literally were taking their
15:35
arms and burning them they were putting
15:37
on all fruits to burn them even parts of
15:40
them or family members i don't want to
15:43
add that but this is how bad it was back
15:45
in that day and so god was going to stop
15:48
all that he wanted that stopped you
15:49
can't give people his burnt offerings
15:51
they were doing that and so that was why
15:54
that was made you're not allowed to have
15:55
to pass through the fire was literally
15:57
don't take parts of you and burn it on
15:59
the altar to some wicked god
16:02
that's what they were doing so that was
16:03
made for that purpose it had nothing to
16:05
do with you cannot be cremated
16:08
and so he actually when he sent me back
16:10
from heaven the first time tell
16:11
everybody it's okay to be cremated is
16:14
cheaper and it really is
16:16
thousands and thousands of dollars
16:19
less to be cremated if you want to put
16:21
them in a jar or something like that
16:23
excuse me find something nice i've
16:26
been talking a lot
16:30
if you want to find something nice to to
16:32
put their ashes in that's perfectly fine
16:35
if you want to put them in a niche you
16:37
know at a cemetery or something that's
16:38
also okay if you want to spread them on
16:40
the river if that was their decision to
16:42
do that he knows where every one of
16:44
those ashes are and you'll be able to
16:46
put them back together but really
16:48
realistically
16:49
i know since we we have sent my one
16:51
brother on to glory
16:53
it was like forty thousand dollars uh
16:56
forty to eighty thousand dollars to have
16:58
a standard funeral
17:00
that included the casket and the burial
17:03
and all of that was very expensive
17:06
we had my brother cremated like we did
17:08
the rest of our family members and then
17:10
you know uh it's okay you know we we
17:13
know where they are they're in their
17:15
jars they're in their little things
17:16
treasure chest whatever
17:18
um but it's okay with god to do that
17:21
because i think it was like i don't know
17:23
you can i think you can get cremation
17:24
done for like a thousand dollars
17:26
sometimes less depending on where you
17:28
where you take that body to be done
17:30
most funeral homes do perform cremations
17:33
and you can actually still have a
17:34
ceremony with a picture of them there
17:37
maybe the the beautiful urn or whatever
17:39
you have them put in and
17:42
to me it was still just a sign of
17:44
release and releasing them into heaven i
17:46
planned this whole service it was a
17:48
joyful one we actually celebrated we ate
17:51
and we sang and it was a beautiful thing
17:54
to send somebody off to heaven but
17:56
please don't let people's opinions or
17:59
their misinterpretation of the
18:01
scriptures keep you from not having to
18:04
spend tens of thousands of dollars i've
18:07
actually had people call crying saying i
18:09
should have had them buried the proper
18:11
way we could only afford cremation i
18:13
went then you did the right thing and
18:15
they're okay with that in heaven by the
18:17
way your family members are okay with
18:19
that
18:20
that's awesome that's awesome though
18:22
that's gonna encourage a lot of people
18:23
can't so all right
18:25
this next question we talked about just
18:27
before you came on the air
18:29
um
18:32
there's so much i could say but the
18:33
bottom line is there's this thing going
18:35
around about the flat earth
18:37
talk
18:38
talk to the people about this thing
18:41
and what what does god put on your heart
18:43
to say about all these people believing
18:45
in a flat earth
18:48
first of all talk a little bit about
18:49
what they think it is what they think it
18:51
is not what it is okay
18:53
right someone had in their head it
18:56
always starts with a thought in
18:58
somebody's head a man's head not gods
19:01
okay obviously
19:03
uh so what they do when they think well
19:05
i really for some reason i believe and
19:08
some of them can use ancient maps from
19:10
when people cross the ocean and they
19:13
actually would draw at that time they
19:15
drew it flat they didn't normally they
19:17
have no conception of how to draw like a
19:20
curved earth and show a map with the
19:22
water and the travel um
19:25
uh the travel route of where they were
19:27
going to go so it made sense to draw
19:30
just a flat thing and then show the
19:33
shipping ship going across and a lot of
19:35
the charts were made like that way back
19:37
then some are even still made that way
19:39
it's just out of convenience
19:42
but whenever these thoughts come usually
19:45
it's the enemy and i have to tell you
19:47
the enemy sometimes doesn't just give
19:49
wicked thoughts he gives stupid ones
19:53
because yeah if he can't get you to go
19:56
into sin if he can't get you to fall
19:59
apart and just you know dissolve and
20:01
give up your whole life then he will get
20:03
you distracted
20:06
and some of the biggest distractions
20:08
going on in the earth right now are some
20:09
of the most ridiculous things
20:12
and but this flat earth thing they
20:14
consider it a thing it's a society which
20:17
means it's a group of people who've
20:19
dedicated themselves to prove the earth
20:21
is flat millions of dollars have been
20:24
wasted on that
20:26
and i know you'll say what about nasa
20:28
what about all that stuff i'll address
20:30
that in a minute
20:32
but they will come back to you i know
20:33
people who got out of it and i mean
20:35
literally got out of it they had to call
20:37
sam they had to call and say i'm no
20:39
longer part of this take me off of the
20:41
roll don't count me in anymore i'm not
20:43
throwing my money away because they had
20:45
revelation from god the earth is round
20:48
okay a world is round okay
20:53
and
20:53
the earth is a shadow and a type of
20:56
heaven so the earth in the planets are
20:59
styled after heaven itself heaven is a
21:02
world
21:03
and i know i laugh about all this
21:05
because a lot of people when they draw
21:06
heaven they draw a flat place up in the
21:08
sky with a few clouds thrown in for free
21:12
maybe a rainbow dazzling across the
21:14
clouds it isn't any of that it is a
21:17
literal world it says in the book of
21:19
john or jesus said in my father's house
21:21
are many mansions
21:23
that house is not a building it's not a
21:27
square thing which shutters on and a
21:29
roof it is a whole world
21:31
it would take the world to put heaven
21:33
because heaven is bigger than our entire
21:35
galaxy system
21:37
and uh and there's a lot going on there
21:39
there's real life there in your
21:40
spiritual body but the flat earth thing
21:43
back to the flat earth society i have to
21:46
throw this in for free um before the
21:48
flat earth thing came up
21:50
probably somebody who believed in the
21:52
middle earth decided to make it a flat
21:54
earth because they could never prove
21:56
there was a middle earth there was a
21:58
whole middle earth society probably
22:00
maybe 50 years ago or before that a
22:02
little bit that they believed because
22:04
the bible talked about descending
22:07
and they talked about abraham's bosom or
22:09
paradise
22:11
which is in the center of the earth that
22:13
is a spiritual abode and in paradise or
22:17
abraham's bosom was where all the
22:18
righteous who were counted as righteous
22:20
by god like moses abraham isaac you know
22:23
uh before jesus christ died on the cross
22:27
and shed his blood
22:28
other than elijah and enoch
22:31
who the father took up to heaven himself
22:34
still in their natural bodies
22:35
nobody ascended into heaven when they
22:38
died before jesus came and paid a price
22:40
to give us a way back to the father they
22:43
descended into this gloriously beautiful
22:45
place which i have seen
22:47
called abraham's bosom and it says that
22:49
in the bible it also calls it paradise
22:52
and i have proved when jesus was on the
22:54
cross with the two thieves the one of
22:56
them was just bashing him you know they
22:58
were laughing making mocking him but the
23:00
other thief said don't don't do anything
23:02
and he's done nothing wrong and so he
23:04
turns his head towards jesus says
23:06
remember me when you come into your
23:08
kingdom
23:09
in other words he was repenting he said
23:10
i'm a sinner you know i i deserve this
23:13
but but you don't talking to jesus so
23:16
remember me when you come into your
23:17
kingdom so he was saying i have sinned i
23:20
repented the sins i receive you as my
23:23
lord and savior on the cross
23:25
by the way without getting baptized in
23:26
water or baptism in the holy spirit so
23:28
you people out there demanding everybody
23:31
have all these things done traditions
23:32
done and there's nothing wrong with them
23:34
but you must repent of your sins
23:37
and believe on jesus christ as your
23:39
savior that's how you get to heaven so
23:40
jesus turns
23:42
his head to the stephen says to him
23:45
today
23:46
you shall be with me in paradise
23:49
well
23:50
obviously the cross is not paradise
23:52
israel's not paradise what was he
23:54
talking about jesus himself was going to
23:57
descend into paradise which was higher
24:00
up than where hell was you can actually
24:02
see
24:02
from a part of paradise you can see a
24:04
little bit of the gates of hell which
24:06
would be
24:07
a little bit further down but a big wolf
24:11
was between paradise and hell and nobody
24:14
could cross over by the way it wasn't
24:16
something you could do in your spiritual
24:18
body you couldn't go from one place to
24:20
the other and so people began to look
24:22
for paradise and there was a whole group
24:25
unfortunately started here in florida
24:28
there were the mid middle earth people
24:31
middle earth society
24:32
and they said if they walked along the
24:34
beach far enough it was a downward thing
24:36
they would then enter into the middle
24:38
earth well we know that's a joke just
24:40
like the flat earth society is a joke
24:43
and i think because they could never
24:44
find middle earth they decided to call
24:47
it a flat earth
24:48
and therefore they began to search the
24:50
scriptures to find what things they
24:52
could make to find to prove the earth
24:54
was flat and they came up with two
24:56
different ones which don't mean at all
24:59
what they say they mean
25:02
number one if you don't have revelation
25:04
from the father part of the word is
25:06
talking about the spirit realm it isn't
25:09
always talking about this natural realm
25:12
there's a scripture that talks about the
25:14
four corners of the earth and that is
25:16
one of the main ones they these in this
25:19
flatter society see there's corners that
25:22
means it has to be flat it can't be
25:24
round
25:25
and the first time i heard that i was
25:27
like i was in shock i laughed out loud i
25:29
went you do realize that scripture is
25:32
talking about the north south east and
25:35
west
25:36
those are directions that has nothing to
25:38
do with the earth is flat whatsoever and
25:41
and then there's another one that talks
25:43
about the columns there's columns or
25:45
pillars that are holding up under the
25:47
earth and so they say look it's flat
25:50
it's sitting on a table like thing
25:51
there's a structure with legs on it and
25:53
what do you not realize that those two
25:56
pillars are angels that are talked about
25:59
in the book of genesis where when their
26:01
time comes they're thousands of feet
26:03
tall
26:04
if you ever
26:05
the spiri spirit realm you see
26:07
uh that they're there they're waiting
26:10
waiting for what well it talks about in
26:12
the bible in the last days when one
26:14
angel will put one foot in the middle of
26:17
the ocean
26:18
and in the middle of the land it says it
26:20
very clearly and that's what one of
26:22
those columns or pillars are sometimes
26:24
those are angels
26:26
and having been passed and out above the
26:28
earth i can see the two angels standing
26:31
there but i do need to give you a
26:33
scripture that says jesus sits above the
26:37
circle of the earth so let all of the
26:40
flat earth be flushed down the toilet
26:42
where it becomes
26:43
because this is a world made by the
26:46
hands of god handmade by him for the
26:48
purpose of sending us from himself that
26:52
we would come into this natural realm
26:54
and have a physical body that we would
26:56
keep with us through all eternity so
26:58
basically that's it
27:01
but these people who have nothing better
27:03
to do obviously with their money or
27:04
their life go looking for people who are
27:07
hoping there's some other thing out
27:09
there that they can prove exist
27:11
and they have people pour millions of
27:14
dollars into this flat earth society it
27:17
just used to be the flat earth theory i
27:19
guess when a bunch of people men got
27:21
together and decided it was so important
27:22
they'd actually name it a society so
27:24
it'd have a name uh there literally are
27:26
people some even well-known people uh or
27:30
rich people who have become a part of
27:32
this thing they could be made to feel
27:34
special they're contributing to what
27:35
they call is truth it's nothing but a
27:38
distraction from satan
27:40
these people should be winning the loss
27:41
giving to the poor helping to build
27:43
things or promote the kingdom
27:45
or jesus christ himself by the way jesus
27:48
laughs when they say that i just have to
27:50
tell you every time in heaven they hear
27:52
someone talking about their their
27:53
meetings they have meetings usually not
27:56
announced meetings trust me they they
27:58
don't want the the general public to
28:00
know they'd be coming and laughing at
28:01
them but jesus laughs every time they
28:03
hear the earth is really flat
28:06
because you know the word made
28:08
everything jesus made this earth he
28:09
knows it's round it has a core a very
28:12
core in it and it goes outward to the
28:14
land it talks about the different levels
28:16
of the earth uh that god made that he
28:18
made and then he made the sky around it
28:21
that's the first heavens then there's a
28:23
second heaven which is just a higher a
28:24
part of god the third heaven
28:26
is where the throne room is is where
28:28
heaven itself the world called heaven
28:30
you can't see with your natural eyes
28:32
because it's a spiritual world but there
28:34
is absolutely no flat earth and i have
28:37
to use this to explain just because i
28:39
like to okay let's say here's the flat
28:41
earth right and there's pilots going
28:44
around this letter so i guess when they
28:47
get to the edge they just flip it all
28:51
over to the other side of the flat earth
28:54
to get where they're going
28:56
so uh i mean there are some things that
28:58
are so ridiculous for people just to
29:00
waste their time on so uh but the earth
29:02
is round it is a world he sits above the
29:05
circle of this earth and then there's
29:07
another one that says the earth is
29:08
footstool i think some of them like to
29:10
say there's another proof see it's flat
29:12
with a cushion on top of it
29:14
they keep changing the shape of this
29:17
flat earth it's almost hilarious yeah
29:19
except that this sucks time and the life
29:22
of people away which they could be doing
29:24
better things well yeah i appreciate you
29:27
doing that you know plus i i'm
29:29
while you're talking i'm thinking i seem
29:31
to remember that people that were sharp
29:34
shooters like for the military they even
29:36
have to
29:38
use their scopes and use their settings
29:41
on their rifles to to take into
29:43
consideration the curvature of the earth
29:46
where they won't be accurate and then of
29:48
course you have pilots who who have to
29:51
take in the curvature of the earth
29:53
and all of their navigation they got a
29:55
guide that's a full-time navigator if
29:57
it's a bitcoin you know
29:59
and yeah it's crazy what people will
30:01
waste their time on but that way well
30:03
one one more thing to throw in with all
30:05
that because i mentioned it is nasa the
30:08
national aeronautics space
30:09
administration
30:11
um we know what the all the stuff they
30:14
put forward to just to have discoveries
30:17
and any of you who don't realize all
30:19
those missions we've sent into space or
30:22
around the earth
30:23
have produced so many products you're
30:26
using right now systems ways to create
30:29
things do things they have ways to test
30:31
things that can't be tested anywhere
30:33
else so this whole thing about exploring
30:36
was something god put in us we want to
30:38
know what's there what's out there
30:40
they see the round earth all the time
30:43
and they have to plan your right their
30:45
trajectories
30:47
have to be planned taking in the
30:48
curvature of not just part of the earth
30:50
but the whole earth
30:52
uh also they're planned how long will
30:54
they be out there how long will it take
30:55
to go around the earth if they're going
30:57
to go from there to the moon
30:58
um
30:59
and the flat earth people say they're
31:02
lying
31:06
they made it all up just to prove try to
31:10
prove the earth is round and not flat
31:12
it's like i guess when you get stuck in
31:14
a ditch you're really in the ditch and
31:16
can't get out i think some of them need
31:18
help to get out of that ditch but the
31:20
earth is not flat it is beautifully
31:22
round heaven is a beautifully round
31:25
sphere it's a sphere it is not a flat
31:28
anything okay so don't worry about
31:30
falling off the edge you're okay
31:34
that's good
31:35
all right let's see um
31:38
uh okay here's
31:40
pardon me i don't know how to pronounce
31:42
her name i've been i've been a
31:44
hairstylist
31:46
i've been a hair stylist since i was 19.
31:48
i'm very good at it and really enjoy it
31:50
will i be able to do hair in heaven
31:55
well that is a wonderful wonderful
31:57
question and the answer is actually yes
31:59
but heaven is on another whole level in
32:02
every way
32:03
the highest tech is in heaven it's not
32:06
on the earth and the only reason people
32:08
have more technology here or greater
32:10
technology or levels of it is because
32:13
those ideas come from heaven itself into
32:16
the mind of man now those are great
32:17
ideas okay god's ideas produce good
32:20
satans produce stupid or distractions
32:22
that's what they do
32:24
so those ideas come from god but yes um
32:28
one reason why you'll be able to do that
32:30
when god made all of us when he made us
32:33
and carried us inside of himself he put
32:36
in you a gift
32:38
it says every good and perfect gift
32:40
comes down from the father of lights
32:42
well when we lived in the father we were
32:44
little spirits we were our spiritual
32:46
body and we had light because we lived
32:48
inside of him
32:50
and uh so we were weren't just like
32:52
little floaty things so we had a little
32:54
spiritual body and we played inside of
32:56
him
32:57
and uh and then and we had light on the
32:59
inside of us
33:00
but each one of us were made special
33:03
because of what he put in the passion to
33:06
do something or be something
33:08
well i can tell you if you can look at
33:10
my hair i did not do this a salon
33:13
operator who's highly skilled makes my
33:16
hair look wonderful all the time and yes
33:19
that is her gift and she loves to do it
33:21
and she does it well athletes who are
33:24
gifted are better than the ones who are
33:26
just trained and have talent there's a
33:28
difference in having a talent and being
33:31
trained in something than being that
33:33
gift and we know there's all kind of
33:35
shows they want the most talented the
33:38
most gifted uh they're all over
33:41
the tv and on the internet
33:43
and you know when that person has a gift
33:46
the way they sing captivates you it just
33:49
carries you places it's amazing artist
33:53
there's a big difference in an artist
33:55
and you can just kind of make something
33:57
or you make something that people go wow
33:59
that is amazing
34:00
that's the person's gift
34:03
and all kinds of people have gifts maybe
34:05
not just to art or singing or even dance
34:09
like ballet yes they have ballet that
34:11
you don't wear choo-choos and stuff in
34:12
heaven but you do get to use the gift
34:14
that you are gardeners have a gift there
34:17
are gardens that go from miles in heaven
34:20
the most beautiful flowers but the
34:22
flowers sing and change colors in heaven
34:25
so you can imagine being a gardener
34:27
tending things like that
34:29
uh people who create beautiful things to
34:31
wear in heaven they still they still do
34:34
that in heaven now you have to
34:35
understand in heaven there's nothing
34:37
that's defiling
34:39
revealing
34:41
nothing that would be seductive in any
34:43
way in your clothing but it's beautiful
34:45
amazing it always feels good it looks
34:48
good and there's all different styles of
34:50
clothing that you can have in heaven
34:52
because you know why those people have a
34:54
gift
34:55
even rodeos are in heaven why that is a
34:57
gift people like the spectacular the
34:59
exciting the adventurous awesome
35:02
all of these are gifts and or or cooking
35:06
wow you know uh cooking is called an art
35:08
in heaven
35:10
really really
35:11
baking yes they have bakeries why
35:13
because those bakers had a gift on earth
35:16
if they never got to use it on earth
35:18
when they get to heaven they'll have a
35:20
whole bakery and everything they need to
35:21
create delicious amazing things that
35:24
they offer to everybody for free but
35:27
that's why i know there are salons by
35:28
the way i was actually taking the one
35:31
and they have all kinds of i don't know
35:33
gizmos and things to use but they use
35:36
light to color your hair there's no
35:38
chemicals there's no heat applied
35:40
nothing like that
35:41
and yes you can have your hair any color
35:43
you want in heaven sometimes they apply
35:45
diamond dust emerald dust
35:47
um and then you go in the throat into
35:49
the throne room and the glory of god
35:51
reflects off of all the gemstones you're
35:54
wearing or if it's in your hair it's not
35:56
about making yourself be better than
35:58
anybody there's no pride in heaven
36:01
but the fun in advent
36:03
even training pets that's a gift let me
36:06
tell you i know people who can and who
36:07
cannot do it uh don't take your pet to
36:10
be trained by somebody who doesn't know
36:11
what they're doing
36:12
you probably won't like them when they
36:13
get back
36:14
but every kind of thing you know that
36:16
goes on around you
36:18
uh so there are architects in heaven
36:20
there's designers there's event planners
36:23
people have events all the time in
36:24
heaven and there's some who do it to
36:26
perfection and i can tell you when it's
36:28
a gift it's like breathing you do it so
36:31
easily
36:33
they actually have event planners like
36:36
like in a sense here you would hire them
36:40
but there you wouldn't hire them but
36:42
they'd agree to
36:43
plan something right yes you schedule
36:46
them to come and do an event for you in
36:48
heaven maybe on your property you want
36:50
to do something and there's everything
36:52
amazing available no matter what type of
36:55
event you want to have
36:58
many people's mansions are big enough to
37:00
hold hundreds of people their grounds
37:02
are so massive they can hold thousands
37:04
tens of thousands of people if they
37:06
wanted to
37:07
and and then there's places in heaven
37:09
you could go to the valley of the falls
37:12
or a passionate paradise you could go to
37:14
the surf park and you don't have to pay
37:16
to rent anything you use these beautiful
37:19
places you just let that let them let
37:21
them there are people who are in charge
37:22
of that describes who who book your
37:24
events for you and then you advertise by
37:27
standing in the middle of your grounds
37:29
and saying hello everybody i'm going to
37:31
have this beautiful event it's going to
37:33
be held at this place just show up
37:36
whenever you can get there and they
37:38
don't have days and weeks but they
37:39
usually will announce that right at the
37:42
time when it's ready they've done all
37:43
the preparations it's all ready to go
37:45
they'll announce and say just come when
37:46
you when you're ready because we're
37:48
going we're starting right now
37:50
and so oh yeah it could be any kind of
37:53
event fun events adventures uh hiking
37:56
events in the mountain of spices um it's
37:59
just it's just it's almost un
38:02
unbelievable the beautiful things they
38:05
have the exciting fun things but if
38:07
you're an event planner can you imagine
38:09
planning an event and the mountain of
38:12
spices where the trees talk wow where
38:14
the leaves it looks like fall all the
38:16
time but the leaves are huge and there's
38:19
purple and there's reds and these
38:20
yellows and golds and there's beautiful
38:22
places to hold events up there in the
38:24
mountain spices you can go backpacking
38:26
trail riding um while the horses are
38:28
talking to you that you're riding on
38:30
talking about where you're going
38:32
you can do photo shoots yes they have
38:34
cameras not made like ours and the
38:36
unlimited mega pixels for all your
38:38
photographers
38:40
i love those mega pixels
38:42
heaven is a glorious
38:44
exciting
38:45
amazing place and with all of that
38:48
you get the presence of jesus christ the
38:51
father and holy spirit and when it can't
38:54
even number the angels that are in
38:56
heaven they're everywhere some of them
38:57
take care of the forest
38:59
they take care of the flowers they take
39:02
care of the waterfalls
39:04
um but it's a beautiful place so yes if
39:06
you're an event planter you got it made
39:08
when you get to heaven make sure you
39:09
know jesus christ
39:11
are there are there some people that
39:13
have how you said that some are so big
39:15
that you can put hundreds of people in
39:17
someone asked you what's the largest
39:19
house or
39:21
examples of some of the largest houses
39:24
you've seen in heaven homes houses would
39:27
um and and if someone has a massive
39:30
mansion and someone has
39:32
a less than mentioned as far as size
39:35
um would they would they say can i use
39:38
your mansion to hold my event because
39:40
it'll hold hundreds of something like
39:42
that does that kind of thing happen i
39:43
think that is probably quite correct
39:45
because everybody in heaven wants to
39:47
serve one another
39:48
uh you know it says to be the greatest
39:50
of all you be the servant of all
39:51
everybody wants to serve
39:54
not just prove that they're greater it's
39:56
the love it's the love it's the care
39:59
that's there nobody's left out and oh
40:01
i'm sure they would be pleased for you
40:04
to come home in their mansion the
40:05
biggest mansion i ever was shown in
40:07
heaven belonged to an intercessor
40:11
really
40:12
the mansion
40:14
was the size of new york city
40:19
and that's because the intercession
40:22
uh receive it caused that many rewards
40:25
to come to this person
40:27
through because of their intercession is
40:29
that the is that kind of the point
40:31
yes this person had prayed in four moves
40:34
of god had prayed for people who hated
40:36
them who pray they would pray and
40:39
intercede um in such great authority
40:42
because they made it a lifestyle and i
40:45
know you're all probably picturing
40:47
they're on their knees you know with a
40:48
little altar in a closed dark room doing
40:51
nothing but praying you know their life
40:53
away it wasn't like that they lived a
40:55
life of prayer no matter where they were
40:58
they interceded all the time by speaking
41:01
and declaring
41:02
knowing that god would do these things
41:04
because they they'd known them from a
41:05
child but that was their reward and
41:08
nobody nobody was upset that they had
41:10
this reward because you know these
41:12
people paid a price with their life the
41:14
other place i've seen with some of the
41:16
biggest mansions would be the martyrs
41:18
the martyr side of heaven there's a
41:20
whole area that's for the martyrs who
41:22
really gave your life they were
41:24
fantastic
41:26
places that i saw there
41:28
um wow did the people um
41:31
the the this is the first time i
41:33
realized that they're all in one place
41:35
i've never heard that before
41:37
or
41:39
when you say they're all in one place is
41:40
that
41:41
literally if you died a martyr
41:44
are you
41:45
are you headed towards that place or how
41:48
was it that god
41:49
chose
41:50
maybe can you give any more detail on
41:52
that
41:53
like i'm a martyr suddenly i died as a
41:56
martyr i was killed during the course of
41:59
serving the lord and
42:01
um do i am i automatically going to
42:04
martyr heaven for lack of a better word
42:07
it's just a whole area where they're
42:09
they're highly honored there people go
42:11
there just to see
42:13
uh they know most of the people you
42:15
learn about people when you get to
42:16
heaven if you didn't know much about
42:18
them you will learn a lot about people's
42:20
lives
42:20
and the price they paid and what they
42:22
gave
42:23
sometimes um being a martyr means you
42:26
it's not just like taking a bullet for
42:28
somebody it's not just that
42:30
it's that you lay down your life it
42:32
talks about lengthy on your life for
42:34
others laying down your life for others
42:35
that
42:36
because you care about them so maybe you
42:39
you maybe you are taking on the brunt of
42:41
something or or not necessarily a burden
42:44
but a challenge that they would have had
42:46
to take or would have had to do but but
42:48
they didn't and you gave your life for
42:50
doing that let's say mother teresa for
42:52
example yes she's in heaven people why
42:55
wouldn't she be she gave her an entire
42:57
existence just to love people and help
42:59
see them healed and
43:01
she wasn't afraid to touch the sick or
43:03
the lame i mean they came to her uh she
43:05
poured herself and poured god into
43:07
people
43:08
uh that there'd be an area in it's just
43:11
called they we know it's not called
43:13
martyrs heaven people just know the
43:15
people who gave their life literally
43:16
gave their life were they have places
43:19
there
43:21
beautiful mansions like everyone has a
43:23
mansion they have a gorgeous mansion but
43:25
the grounds around that whole mansion
43:27
would be very significant fantastic and
43:29
amazing because of them giving their
43:32
whole self for somebody for somebody for
43:34
jesus christ and uh and everybody wants
43:37
to go just to see
43:39
now you still would have an area that
43:41
would be yours near your families and he
43:44
said to go to prepare a place he doesn't
43:46
say you have to have one mansion by the
43:48
way and he actually said that to me
43:50
because on the grounds of this mansion
43:52
in the martyrs area in this martyr's
43:55
beautiful area there are doors
43:58
on that mansion property when they step
44:00
through that door they would be into the
44:02
by the mansion that's near all of their
44:04
family
44:06
and they would walk through the door on
44:07
that property come back to the other one
44:10
the one that god gives them like part of
44:12
the reward it's like instead of having a
44:14
beautiful medallion or stuff like that
44:16
giving them this
44:18
and people want to go see your reward
44:20
and so that's why that is that's why
44:22
that's been established there and i'm
44:23
not the only one who's seen it there's
44:25
other people who've talked about the
44:27
martyr part of heaven i i remember years
44:30
and years ago rick joyner told of the
44:32
experience of going to heaven
44:34
he said some of the greatest
44:37
monuments i'll use the word that i think
44:39
he probably used but
44:40
uh uh to another person
44:44
were when he would see these massive
44:47
monuments
44:48
uh to praying mothers i mean a specific
44:51
woman let's say my mother's name is
44:53
frida let's say she was an intercessor
44:55
she's she's still with us right now but
44:59
you know
45:00
if she's a praying mother i don't know
45:02
how much of a prayer praying mother she
45:04
was but
45:06
if she was then that would be they would
45:08
be a massive
45:10
um
45:11
memorial uh or something
45:15
memorial was the writer memorial was the
45:17
right one
45:18
okay i actually was taken to two
45:21
people's memorials and shown them uh one
45:23
was dan crouches
45:25
really really i saw a memorial i saw
45:28
while it was still being built in heaven
45:30
she hadn't passed yet and i saw it and
45:32
it was the most it was so beautiful it
45:34
was an area and there was this beautiful
45:37
fountain that's why i said a memorial
45:39
it's a whole park and it's and it's
45:41
dedicated to jan's love for the children
45:44
of the world this is actually says that
45:46
on this uh and in gratefulness to jan's
45:49
love for the children of the world
45:50
because you know she did a lot for kids
45:52
all over the world and gave herself for
45:54
that
45:55
and and there's this beautiful memorial
45:57
fountain but there's a whole park that
46:00
people can go in and do things
46:01
especially kids and i don't know if
46:03
you've heard me talk about the platform
46:05
where kids go stand on a platform and a
46:06
big bubble is formed around they float
46:08
around heaven with their friends and all
46:10
these bubbles well that's where i saw it
46:12
was at jan's memorial wow
46:14
it's a fun place kids in heaven can go
46:17
and have a fun time but there's other
46:19
things to do in this hope it's a park
46:21
but the memorial actually itself is this
46:24
massive fountain i i couldn't even tell
46:26
you the square footage of it or the
46:27
height of it but around the sides
46:30
is like a child's face or figure from
46:33
every nation around the world and when
46:36
you walk past that part of the fountain
46:38
it comes alive
46:40
like the sculpture that sculpted into
46:42
this mountain the child comes alive and
46:45
it laughs it looks at you it's like
46:48
living hearties
46:50
and i walked all around the sun
46:53
captivated i mean i saw children like
46:55
from africa
46:56
from india from uh from all the
46:59
different places in the world where she
47:01
would have food and gifts taken to them
47:03
she did it her whole life
47:05
and this walks her memorial it's got her
47:07
name on it so and sometimes we would
47:10
think of a monument it's just like an
47:12
obelisk kind of a concrete thing right
47:14
it's so much more than that uh some of
47:17
them have parts of that included in
47:19
there maybe things they did that would
47:21
represent i've seen uh i went into
47:23
another one where you went into this
47:26
building and you you watched things it
47:29
wasn't just like a a movie theater was
47:31
great greater beyond that you walk past
47:33
these things they've been created that
47:34
was scenes from their life
47:37
and you would actually watch them when
47:39
they rescue people help people pray for
47:41
them
47:42
brought themselves you would see what
47:44
they did it was recorded but it was like
47:47
real life
47:49
it was on my flat screen and i explained
47:51
it was like no more than 3d dimension
47:54
you literally were watching like you
47:55
were there
47:57
seeing what they did then you would step
47:59
up and you would go to another one it
48:00
was fantastic
48:02
uh then another one um i saw that was uh
48:06
like a pool this beautiful pool it went
48:08
for forever and there was a crystal
48:11
bridge and you'd walk across this
48:13
critical crystal bridge and in this
48:15
beautiful lake were like round open
48:17
portals and it was sort of the same
48:19
thing that you would look down in these
48:21
pools of
48:23
the portals i called them parts but the
48:25
pools and from this crystal bridge you
48:27
could see all the different acts of
48:29
kindness
48:30
or liberty liberating people maybe
48:32
people in the military who liberated
48:35
areas and things that they had talking
48:36
about the plans and the things they did
48:39
now there's no death or destruction
48:40
shown in any things but you're not going
48:43
to miss
48:44
knowing what these people did with their
48:46
lives on the earth
48:49
yeah that's you and and
48:51
cat how long does that go on
48:54
i know there's no time in heaven
48:57
but if if eternity is
48:59
eternity
49:01
are people going by these memorials for
49:03
all eternity
49:06
having seen i mean eventually you've
49:08
walked by every memorial in heaven so i
49:10
mean
49:12
i think it would take a really
49:15
really long time
49:18
to to see uh some people have their
49:20
favorite ones and sometimes they go
49:22
there with the person
49:24
whose memorial it is oh okay
49:27
yeah they'll take you and go oh it's a
49:29
whole different thing when you go
49:30
through yourself and see or watch or or
49:32
understand what they gave their lives
49:35
you cannot escape being rewarded you're
49:38
not gonna god's gonna make sure you
49:39
don't miss the rewards there's rewards
49:41
now in this life but the ones throughout
49:44
eternity
49:45
and and there's more than just a
49:47
memorial there's places uh
49:49
that have i know it talks about thrones
49:51
around heaven all in heaven and there
49:53
are people who sit on them sometimes
49:55
they get to make some decisions or uh
49:57
maybe people come by just to meet them
49:59
it's not like they're ruling over heaven
50:02
it's just a place of honor there's
50:04
places of honor that maybe they're not
50:06
there all the time but they have
50:07
opportunities to sit there and people
50:08
want to come to see him or something
50:10
like that it's it's beyond your normal
50:12
understanding
50:14
but you're never going to be bored with
50:16
anything that's there it's always going
50:19
to be captivating exciting
50:24
being not bored you've talked a number
50:26
of times about that that you can
50:27
actually be part of making a
50:30
film you could people go to the theater
50:33
and they can watch you at the theater
50:36
if i'm
50:37
you know you correct my language if i'm
50:39
saying this right
50:40
right or wrong but
50:42
the people have written to me a number
50:43
of times and says how is it possible for
50:46
let's say make a john wayne movie with
50:49
john wayne in there
50:51
and some and people going what is there
50:53
to do other than ride a horse
50:56
um you know what i'm saying how does i i
50:58
don't know how does a storyline
51:01
get built into a movie in heaven with
51:04
with zero
51:05
gun shooting and all of that
51:09
specific
51:10
maybe
51:11
maybe i'm saying it wrong but have you
51:13
seen specific movies or parts of them we
51:16
know even when they make movies down
51:18
here they don't actually kill people
51:19
right right that is true last time
51:25
those guns they use here down here
51:28
making movies uh people aren't probably
51:30
really associated much with the
51:32
producing but i've seen both sides of it
51:34
and i understand the making of a movie
51:37
and by the way that's why all those
51:38
credits keep going by forever because
51:40
all those people are parts of making
51:41
this look good the special effects part
51:44
you know the sound part the the film
51:46
part the costumes i mean script people
51:49
and screenwriters and it's more than
51:52
that what you see on the film the few
51:53
people you see in that film it took
51:55
thousands to make that happen
51:57
uh in heaven it's kind of the same way
51:59
there's still things that make things
52:01
happen now they're not going to show
52:02
there's no movies with gore or people
52:05
being murdered or stuff that doesn't
52:07
exist but there are exciting intense fun
52:11
different things to see in movies
52:13
and yeah he could do a cattle drive
52:15
stuff sort of like that take people and
52:17
categorize for the first time and
52:19
some of them are funny because you know
52:20
john wayne had an actual funny side
52:22
there's no
52:24
no
52:24
profanity
52:27
it doesn't exist in heaven not even
52:29
explaining or showing things there's no
52:31
profanity so you're not going to see a
52:33
lot of swearing or sexual things or
52:36
witchcraft not at all
52:39
no extreme no violence of any kind no
52:42
one dying suffering or agony but you
52:44
know why because they're highly gifted
52:47
and it's good when they make things
52:48
people want to go see these things made
52:50
by people who know jesus christ john
52:52
wayne accepted jesus christ that's
52:54
really known in many places
52:57
his daughter was there present when she
52:58
received christ and it was while he was
53:01
watching a show i think the crystal
53:02
cathedral so stop knocking them people
53:05
uh when they had a meeting there and led
53:07
people to christ that was the time when
53:08
john wayne in his own room
53:11
not there yes and he was in a lot of
53:14
pain at the time and um they said if
53:16
possible get on your knees i know this
53:18
all to be true and so his i don't know
53:21
if his daughter helped him he said i'm
53:22
getting on my knees he got off of his
53:24
bed
53:25
um and got on your knees and received
53:28
jesus christ and saved yourself
53:31
so the movie
53:32
the movie group in heaven were the
53:34
production people were really happy when
53:36
john wayne showed up
53:40
so there is there's like shooting and
53:42
stuff and uh like things like that but
53:44
there's no blood being splattered
53:46
anywhere and there's not real bullets
53:48
and
53:49
um now i could tell you this when you go
53:51
on hunts up in the mountain of spices
53:54
the only way you shoot things is with
53:56
the camera scope and you're taking the
53:57
pictures going back to this big
53:59
clubhouse they have there people are
54:01
shaking their hands saying you're nuts
54:02
well then you're saying heaven is nuts
54:04
and you haven't been there so forget it
54:06
hello so
54:08
these things we enjoy on the earth
54:10
there's just a different way they do it
54:11
in heaven but it's just as exciting
54:13
intense funny amazing captivating and as
54:17
the father tells me all the time he said
54:21
i would be in trouble if i have said you
54:23
must come like a little child and
54:24
there's not fun here
54:28
so there's a lot of fun and exciting
54:30
things to do in heaven and people have
54:32
gifts on the earth that did stuff
54:34
similar in heaven but it's so much more
54:36
fantastic so that all ties back to the
54:39
whole salon thing the reason why there
54:41
will be is because god gifted people
54:43
with that so he has to make a way for
54:45
them to use that gift in heaven no
54:47
matter whether it's a baker a painter a
54:50
designer
54:51
a director an events planner
54:54
those those rodeos i mean amusement
54:56
parks people have to have gifts to
54:59
create those things the only thing not
55:02
in them is evil wickedness darkness but
55:05
that doesn't mean you're not going to
55:07
have a good time i never cared for the
55:09
dark stuff
55:11
yeah awesome um speaking of fun now this
55:15
because i don't know if the dinosaurs
55:18
lived at the same time that adam and eve
55:19
did or not but it says did adam name the
55:22
dinosaurs were there dinosaurs on the
55:24
ark well probably not in the ark right
55:28
i i think the alligator may be the only
55:30
remnant left of them
55:34
and they they kind of look like one but
55:36
in the much smaller scale i mean really
55:38
kind of similar they were like
55:40
they were on the earth when he made it
55:43
the first time which is another whole
55:45
show
55:48
when it says in the beginning
55:51
god created the heavens and the earth
55:54
okay
55:55
uh there's a time when he made the earth
55:58
that mankind was not on the earth yet he
56:00
made it it was beautiful
56:03
there was no sun to light it it was lit
56:06
by his glory
56:07
and there's a scripture i think in
56:09
jeremiah that talks about when god
56:11
turned the light out
56:13
um
56:14
and then there was darkness upon the
56:16
deep so between verses one and two
56:19
are millions of years if you're not in
56:21
that group
56:22
you'll get over it when you get to
56:24
heaven and find out but when the
56:26
dinosaurs were made when he first made
56:28
the earth i was taken back i saw it it
56:31
was uh the sky was like a peachy pink
56:34
um and there was this water vapor shield
56:36
that he put around the original earth uh
56:39
it's still the same landmass by the way
56:42
and it was round back then
56:44
not flat how about that so when he made
56:47
the earth the first time he made it um
56:50
and
56:51
there was no storms there was no raining
56:54
on the earth so we had to have a way
56:56
to water these hundred foot high flowers
56:58
that i saw there they had forest of
57:00
flowers a small dinosaur could actually
57:03
go stand under one if they wanted to
57:05
uh none of the dinosaurs ate flesh at
57:09
when they first made they ate the
57:11
vegetation they ate the seeds they eat
57:14
the fruit that's what he gave them to
57:16
eat when he first made them they weren't
57:18
wild they weren't them you know harmful
57:21
that happened when satan was cast out of
57:24
heaven
57:25
uh but when he made the earth there was
57:26
time it was beautiful it was such peace
57:29
he put watcher angels who have flesh on
57:32
them on the earth to care for the
57:33
dinosaurs and they would talk to them
57:36
dinosaurs talk after them and so that
57:38
was during that time
57:40
uh when he
57:42
flooded the earth with water the first
57:44
time this was before noah's ark and it
57:47
clearly says in verse two that there was
57:49
darkness upon the face of the deep right
57:51
that was the water and this in the
57:53
spirit hovered over it and god was about
57:56
to remake the earth that so before that
57:59
time was when the dinosaurs existed uh
58:01
there were no cro-magnon men there was
58:03
no cavemen at that time it was just
58:05
god's creatures and the water angels on
58:08
this beautiful earth which you will get
58:09
to see when you get to heaven by the way
58:11
you see all of it happening
58:13
uh and then when he began when he
58:14
decided okay satan's trying to destroy
58:17
the earth and mess it up because he he
58:19
is actually the one who
58:22
made the dinosaurs bad well they began
58:24
to eat each other
58:26
and redestruction on the earth and satan
58:28
began to make it a wilderness which it
58:30
says in the bible it says he began to
58:32
make the earth a wilderness it says that
58:34
this is the original earth and was
58:37
causing destruction on the earth that's
58:39
why god took the light away it says he
58:42
turned the light out he took his glory
58:44
off the earth that brought the darkness
58:46
and then he began uh to break the water
58:49
vapor shield that had twice as much
58:51
water in it that brought a mist down so
58:54
the mist used to come from there and
58:55
from the earth itself and that's how the
58:57
flowers got the water and the dinosaurs
59:00
hide was i can tell you this you can't
59:02
take a dinosaur and stick them in the
59:03
desert but they have found their their
59:05
bones in the desert because that part
59:07
used to have ocean in it
59:10
you can't take a hide this thick and not
59:12
keep water on even alligators crocodiles
59:15
have to stay in the water most of the
59:16
time they come out in the sun for a
59:18
while but if they got trapped out of the
59:20
water that high would eventually crack
59:22
and fall apart so there's all kinds of
59:25
evidence around us that something
59:26
existed before our time and people try
59:29
to make it something else god made the
59:31
earth the first time lit it with his
59:32
glory made this whole system with his
59:35
water vapor shield and then he put two
59:37
handfuls of water on it another water
59:40
vapor shield and it was like being in
59:43
an atrium
59:44
and his glory lift that whole earth so
59:47
with the mist coming and the light of
59:49
the glory it made the sky
59:51
not blue they even need oxygen at that
59:54
time because this was before the fall
59:56
this is before
59:58
the fault happened and things were just
60:00
different run different in verse two
60:03
there's destruction that's happened on
60:05
the earth there's even water on the sky
60:07
it says you remove the water off the
60:09
permanent the firmament is the sky
60:11
so all these in verse two all this stuff
60:14
has happened he didn't make it that way
60:16
and then it says
60:17
clearly he began to replenish the earth
60:22
in other words he was putting it back
60:24
together removing all the excess water
60:26
off of it drying it out where it need to
60:29
be dried out and then he began to
60:31
replenish the earth with the with the
60:33
creatures with the birds and all that
60:35
stuff and then of course we know on the
60:38
sixth day he decided to make man so
60:40
there's you a little bit of a big
60:41
picture that happened
60:43
so the gun way back when um the the
60:46
watcher angels were the ones who cared
60:48
for them and were on the earth with them
60:50
so i do not believe there were actual
60:52
dinosaur dinosaurs i know they show the
60:54
loch ness monster
60:56
in scotland we were there i didn't see
60:58
them by the way
61:00
yeah because we were there too they
61:02
paint the
61:03
on the boat that you take the tour at
61:05
loch ness and then you got a picture of
61:07
the dinos what is it the monster
61:10
on the glass
61:12
messy yeah that's what it was and then
61:14
you see i was taking pictures of the
61:16
glass um okay two more quick questions
61:19
to wrap up uh do our angels
61:23
my apologies do our angels know our
61:26
destiny
61:28
i think most assuredly your guardian
61:31
angels
61:32
know what your destiny is because they
61:34
try to keep you on track
61:37
yeah they do more than just standing
61:39
with a sword you know trying to kill
61:41
anything comes by you
61:43
they they
61:44
they give up they will say things to you
61:46
that will either um
61:48
help heal your soul or maybe inspire
61:50
your soul they'll give you thoughts that
61:53
lead you towards christ they'll give you
61:55
thoughts of ways to fix things
61:57
uh
61:58
they probably help people the people who
62:01
are going to be like creators of
62:02
inventions i'm sure that they help them
62:04
even in that by saying things to them
62:05
that would help them do their inventions
62:07
and stuff like that
62:08
they i do know this they're sent at the
62:11
time of conception
62:12
when you are conceived in your mother's
62:14
room your guardian angels are sent then
62:17
and i will see them walking around
62:18
pregnant women and they're waiting on
62:20
the baby to be born so guess what uh
62:23
just so the left nose there were
62:25
witnesses to what you did to those
62:27
babies
62:28
and no one in heaven is happy about it i
62:31
just had to add that for free but your
62:33
guardian angel is sent at the time of
62:34
conception you are something already
62:37
when he takes that little spirit of life
62:39
from himself and he gets knitted and
62:42
attached to that dot of flesh
62:44
that is your spirit man man cannot make
62:46
the spirit we can't make the spirit okay
62:50
that has to come from god and so at the
62:52
time of conception that's when he sends
62:54
that little spirit of life it talks
62:56
about in the bible when he blew into
62:58
adam's nostrils he takes that and
62:59
attaches it in the mother's womb your
63:02
guardian angels are sent right then
63:03
everybody has more than one because one
63:06
has to take a break and go back to
63:07
heaven and come back
63:09
it says that your angel always is before
63:11
the face of god that means one or the
63:13
other is up there talking about you
63:15
maybe things you need help with and
63:17
maybe things you need to know about
63:19
they're getting some instructions from
63:21
the father to come back but you always
63:23
have one with you all the time
63:26
when you die and step out of this body
63:29
your spirit man steps out the first
63:30
thing you will see will be your own
63:32
guardian angel
63:33
waiting to help escort you to heaven
63:36
nice but i'll be fine that'll be fun
63:38
okay last question are there creatures
63:41
from earth that don't exist in heaven we
63:44
know and that this person wrote we know
63:46
it's the opposite is true that there are
63:47
things on heaven that are not on earth
63:50
are there things on the earth
63:52
creatures that are not in heaven
63:55
i think it wouldn't be the creatures i
63:57
think it would be insects
63:59
oh yeah
64:00
well
64:02
it would be impacting just me yeah i've
64:05
seen every kind of creature that i have
64:07
seen physically on this earth they are
64:09
in heaven
64:10
they're in heaven they're different in
64:12
heaven they have a real life in heaven
64:15
uh every creature can communicate or
64:17
talk to any of the people who are in
64:19
heaven
64:20
um
64:21
they are not eaten in heaven i might as
64:24
well add that nobody goes and shoots or
64:25
kills these creatures who have a real
64:27
life uh god towed noah put every
64:31
creature on the ark that has a spirit of
64:33
life in them that's a spiritual body
64:35
with the soul in it but those on the ark
64:38
okay those are the ones you put on the
64:39
ark
64:40
and there's a reason for that so so when
64:43
creatures die they go to heaven
64:46
and often quite all of your pets go to
64:48
heaven every one of your pets that
64:49
passed away your own guardian angel
64:51
escorts your pet i'll talk about the
64:53
past escort your pet to heaven
64:56
but every kind of thing i've seen
64:58
literally that exists right now on the
65:00
earth the creatures i've seen um some of
65:03
them in heaven
65:04
so but i've seen creatures in heaven
65:07
that were never on the earth i think
65:09
that's the mystery part that's some of
65:11
the wonders that you get to see in
65:13
heaven the things that you never saw
65:15
on this earth that exist in heaven he
65:17
has a lot more there than what he put he
65:19
put some of them on the earth some of
65:21
them you never put on the earth
65:23
yeah
65:24
awesome well cat tell people about
65:26
revealing heaven.com what can they get
65:28
there
65:30
well they can get get my my books my
65:32
products revealingheaven.com is where my
65:36
my company operates and sells the
65:39
product sets up the events and that type
65:41
of thing happens there i think you can
65:44
see some testimonies on that
65:46
and then um so that's where you go to do
65:48
that type of thing i think i have a copy
65:50
of my book somewhere i was just going to
65:52
show my book and now i don't know yeah
65:53
there's a great book i've read the books
65:55
and they're really really good i hope
65:57
people yeah so i have one here i was
65:59
just going to show it to everybody here
66:01
is the book right here it's called
66:03
revealing heaven
66:05
and you see the wing with some of the
66:07
eyes in it and the holy spirit makes me
66:09
laugh all the time he said when you put
66:10
the wing of the living creature on the
66:12
book make sure half's on the front
66:14
half's on the back some people won't
66:16
like your book in the bookstore they'll
66:17
turn it around well if they turn it
66:19
around
66:20
they wouldn't see more of them
66:24
and they'll see me with my pink hair
66:26
that was their plan not mine and so this
66:29
is book one right here i've got book one
66:31
book two totally different uh
66:33
stories and encounters in both of those
66:36
books different places in heaven and
66:38
i'll just show some people there are
66:40
illustrations in this book
66:42
um this would be one of the nursery
66:44
walls in heaven where little babies have
66:46
these beautiful little things they sleep
66:47
and they don't have like a hard bed uh
66:49
beautiful like a big seashells with
66:51
glorious fabrics on it birds flying and
66:54
take them for rides roses and flowers
66:57
grow out of the wall that sing to these
66:58
babies the angels will take them and
67:00
hold them and rock them and sing to them
67:03
and as i've said before babies grow so
67:05
very slow that they're still young when
67:07
you go to heaven later
67:09
and so there's there's all kinds of
67:11
illustrations in this book
67:13
one day we'll make a coffee table book
67:15
with them all in color here's one of uh
67:18
two guardian angels taking the person
67:20
home that they watch
67:23
and uh so the guardian angels look
67:26
mostly like people with wings your
67:28
guardian angels are different than the
67:29
army most of the army are creature-like
67:31
looking things with like eight eyes and
67:33
stuff like that that's so they can see
67:35
the enemy that would be satan and the
67:37
dark army in the front or the back they
67:39
have eyes on the back of the head this
67:41
is a transport
67:42
and uh there's no steps attached to
67:44
anything she walks on steps floating in
67:46
air she was in her 90s when she passed
67:49
away
67:50
her nickname was mrs matt
67:52
and these are her guardian angels who
67:54
escorting her home to heaven
67:56
so this book has illustrations of heaven
67:59
in it and uh
68:00
but a lot of a powerful evidence that
68:02
heaven is real so you would get that one
68:04
or book two we have audio books we now
68:06
have them on uh digital i think like on
68:09
flash drives or downloadable we have got
68:12
so many revelations now we still we do
68:15
still sell cds and dvds and i've been
68:19
told to let them go but there's still
68:20
people out there buying them and they
68:22
don't do digital stuff on the computer
68:24
yet so
68:25
we want everyone to have a chance to
68:27
have it but there's all kinds of
68:29
revelations on the cds dvds some of them
68:32
are um have some instructional stuff on
68:34
it and one thing we'll be adding is a
68:37
lullaby i have an amazing highly gifted
68:40
person who went to the boston
68:42
conservatory of music who sings opera
68:45
and we will be making some cds together
68:48
or even maybe dvds where you'll actually
68:50
hear this beautiful singing songs about
68:52
heaven and then i will be prophesying or
68:54
declaring over your babies over your
68:56
children is something that we will do
68:58
next year this year sorry this year
69:00
sometime this year maybe close to the
69:02
close of the end we'll have all kinds of
69:04
music available eventually that sings
69:06
about heaven
69:07
but so this will be added but we have so
69:09
much revelation i all will help you
69:12
find out about when the earth began what
69:14
that was like the ancient past we have
69:16
um i'm trying to remember the name now
69:19
we have copycat which shows about
69:21
everything that satan has stolen images
69:23
and things that he stole from god and
69:25
perverts them on the earth and then we
69:27
have all kinds of things like the
69:28
kingdom age we have um uh i can't
69:31
remember all the titles marked which is
69:33
for young people
69:35
and it's showing a young person with
69:36
tattoos on their arms or remarks of god
69:39
and talks about what he's going to do
69:40
with that generation in these days
69:42
coming up i release that at a a youth
69:45
thing with 3 000 youth in it and then
69:48
released the lightning power of god into
69:49
every single one of them it was one of
69:51
the most powerful meanings i had
69:53
so a lot of these are events that took
69:55
place since the anointing and the glory
69:57
are on them and you can just so go go to
70:00
to regainingheaven.com and see
70:03
we also do things like i've always
70:04
showed this cup i don't
70:07
right here
70:10
and we try to produce things that
70:12
represent heaven or speak against our
70:14
enemy which would be the devil
70:17
and so there's a lot going on there and
70:18
then i also have oh we even have these
70:21
simple little things like um
70:23
this is we have these little tent cards
70:25
and this is the thing you declare about
70:27
getting grace for abundant life oh god
70:31
and on this side is the prayer the
70:33
declaration you make over your loved
70:34
ones who are not saved
70:36
this is what he said this is what he
70:38
said to tell them to declare and so
70:41
these don't cost almost nothing i think
70:43
and you can add it to any any kind of
70:45
order i'm just going to read what it
70:46
says father i declare that all of my
70:49
family my friends and those that i love
70:51
will become mighty children of god they
70:54
will be free in jesus name they will not
70:56
miss their destiny they will become the
70:58
living testimony of the saving power of
71:00
jesus christ amen
71:02
and that is what uh they have me bring
71:05
back to the earth to tell people you
71:06
declare that over your family members
71:09
and they were they father
71:15
so he gave me the exact
71:17
prayer decree to me
71:20
and then he promised you you
71:23
do this and i'll do that right exactly
71:26
and he's very serious because you know
71:28
even jesus did that
71:30
the famous prayer all right our father
71:33
who is in heaven holy is your name that
71:35
whole thing came from jesus christ this
71:38
is from jesus christ and the father if
71:40
you don't know how to pray for them you
71:42
don't have to tell god how bad and
71:43
wicked they are by the way he knows that
71:46
and i want to add one more you're making
71:48
a stand this is important if you're
71:49
making a stand for someone in your
71:51
family or people who are like family to
71:53
know christ
71:54
don't make the declaration then turn
71:56
around and tell everybody how bad and
71:57
wicked they are not all the time in
71:59
other words if you're giving a testimony
72:01
to somebody that's different but i'm
72:03
just saying you can't be double-minded
72:06
this is your mind set on a of course for
72:09
your family ones or loved ones to know
72:10
jesus okay hold it up right there
72:13
but if you just ask for the declaration
72:15
card it's on uh when you go to order
72:17
something you can always add this you
72:18
can send it to other people so they'll
72:20
know about it so we want to help people
72:23
get into heaven and this is just a good
72:25
way to do it and and you know the word
72:28
says i got to add one more thing the
72:30
word says it's appointed under man to
72:32
die
72:33
wants to die and then the judgment
72:37
i want to assure you that word judgment
72:40
does not talk about the great white
72:41
throne judgment it is not talking about
72:43
the judgment seat of christ it's when
72:45
you die there is a judgment made is
72:49
there someone out there standing for
72:50
them can christ
72:52
use the keys to hell death in the grave
72:56
to do something about your declaration
72:59
because he will and that's why it says
73:01
it's appointed unto me and wants to die
73:03
and then the judgment
73:05
okay that's right when you die there's a
73:06
judgment made
73:08
had these people ever declared have they
73:10
ever asked jesus christ into their heart
73:13
is there someone standing for them to
73:15
make that happen to give time for that
73:16
to happen and this was adamant jesus
73:19
christ was adamant about telling you
73:21
about this so there is ways and jesus
73:24
said to me some people will be shocked
73:26
to see who made it but it was because
73:28
they
73:29
made a stand and didn't get off of that
73:32
stand they kept that stand stand there
73:34
for
73:35
and don't change what you're saying
73:37
about your family members or your
73:38
friends and then there's catker.com
73:40
where you get all kinds of revelation
73:42
training
73:43
um powerful things and it is the only
73:46
way that you can give to me online is to
73:48
go to catcure.com click on the treasury
73:51
and yes you can become a guardian we
73:53
have the guardian zone that's all those
73:55
who give to us we just sent out all of
73:57
our letters to people we sending out the
73:59
gifts that we have purchased for them
74:01
for the guardian zone and i want to say
74:03
like steve
74:04

74:07
you help make it happen and i want to
74:10

74:12
get the same reward we do when you
74:14

74:19
that is a surety so thank you for all
74:22
those who give make sure you do give to
74:24
the elijah list because you wouldn't be
74:25
hearing the prophets right now those who
74:27
are speaking truth the truth makes you
74:30
free
74:31
not just not man's mindset
74:34
not means assumptions not man's plans
74:37
not threats of the enemy but the truth
74:39
makes you free and steve helps to make
74:42
that happen by giving the the microphone

to the prophecy gives us the platform so
74:47
you can know about god know about jesus
74:50

74:54
i am grateful and i thank the father
74:56

75:00
doreen
75:01
in jesus name because i'm bringing him
75:03
to remembrance of all that he has done
75:06
father all that he has done that you
75:07
have asked him to do even to his own
75:10
hurt he has not stopped putting forth
75:13
the true word of god and let the
75:16
prophets be heard who are telling the
75:19
truth that he knows
75:21
and i thank you god for setting steve in
75:24
the place you have given and the
75:26
authority you have given him and i pray
75:28
that every demon flee from him when he
75:30
goes into a place that they shake and
75:32
tremble in fear when he wakes up in the
75:34
morning and feels the presence of the
75:36
living god and gives voice to those who
75:39
speak for him and won't hold back

hey happy wednesday february 9 2022
01:38
welcome to the broadcast uh by the way
01:40
jeff in case we didn't talk about this
01:42
uh or in case we weren't ready to be
01:43
sure to get that video ready we're going
01:45
to run that in a minute so i wanted to
01:47
tell you about the um
01:49
the wells that we are digging that you
01:51
are digging um it's all paid for by you
01:55
our viewers and we're now doing three
01:57
wells a month in uganda so we're going
01:59
to show you uh two things we're going to
02:01
show you a brand new video about the
02:04
wells that are being dug and then at the
02:06
end of the video we're going to show you
02:08
a map of where these wells um are it's
02:11
amazing amazing amazing so this is just
02:14
to remind people that we're in
02:16
partnership with show mercy
02:18
you can find them at
02:19
showmercy.org just like it sounds mike
02:22
and laurie sally uh they are the ones um
02:25
with the village
02:26
called field of dreams in uganda
02:29
and then we're partnering with them to
02:30
get these wells drilled so it's a it's a
02:33
twofer we're both doing it together and
02:35
you'll see the sign
02:37
where it talks about elijah's streams
02:39
and show mercy
02:41
so
02:42
without further ado let's play that
02:44
video jeff
02:55
[Music]
03:15
[Music]
03:25
so
03:27
[Music]
03:35
[Music]
03:47
[Music]
04:50
[Music]
04:58
[Music]
05:01
hello
05:08
[Music]
05:13
wow is that not amazing
05:15
you all did this the reward goes to you
05:18
you're the one that sends in the money
05:20
we take your uh income and we we take
05:23
what you send in we spend uh ten
05:25
thousand dollars per well i think we're
05:28
on well let's look at the map if you can
05:30
put that map up i think it's ten all the
05:33
blues are wells that are finished now
05:36
and if it was bigger i'd read the names
05:38
of these villages every single one of
05:40
those is in a different village and then
05:42
the yellows are the next three uh wells
05:44
i believe though the yellows are the
05:46
february wells that we're digging and we
05:49
plan to keep going we're going to do
05:50
three wells a month all year long and
05:52
don't expect us to stop because we're on
05:54
a roll uh the the people
05:57
mike and laurie have expressed that that
05:59
there's so much more favor they have
06:01
in this whole region in the community
06:03
people now know
06:05
that elijah's dreams and show mercy
06:08
field of dreams are doing are doing this
06:12
and so now they're very very open the
06:13
gospel is being shared
06:16
each of the wells are prayed over and
06:17
anointed and
06:19
as they're finished pastor fred i think
06:21
is his name is helping get this done so
06:24
uh he's one of the the the native
06:26
peoples i'm not sure what you'd say
06:28
though the local
06:30
um
06:31
people
06:32
and he's the pastor there and he's
06:34
helping mike and laura get this done but
06:36
bless you bless you bless you i think at
06:37
the end of every one of our
06:39
videos or every one of our streams
06:41
there's a way to donate there's a link
06:44
uh we put the link on the chat and we
06:47
put the link in below
06:49
youtube we try to put it different
06:50
places so you can donate or mail a check
06:53
we appreciate that so much it not only
06:55
helps us keep this program going but you
06:56
can see where this is going
06:58
and
06:59
i think like i said i think we're at
07:01
well 10
07:02
now it's something like that i'm losing
07:04
track because it's an odd number because
07:06
we started with only one and then we
07:08
started doing two a month and now we're
07:10
doing three a month we will very likely
07:12
increase the number of wells rather than
07:15
decrease it so we'll see what god does
07:17
but isn't that amazing thank you all for
07:19
what you're doing for thank you for
07:20
generosity on behalf of the lord you
07:22
know the lord you saw that scripture you
07:24
even if you give so much as a cup of
07:26
cold water to one of these you will not
07:29
lose your reward if you sent money in
07:32
knowing that a good deal of art we tithe
07:35
out of that and the tithe
07:37
a significant portion of the tithe we
07:39
get
07:39
out of elijah's streams goes right to
07:41
these wells too and then the gospel is
07:43
shared so just wanted to really uh thank
07:46
you thank you thank you all for doing
07:47
that so all right well without further
07:49
ado let's bring kat in here
07:52
hey
07:53
did you see all of our wells there did
07:55
you see that i did that is amazing i'm
07:58
telling you that so blessed is the heart
08:00
of god i know it's helping the people
08:02
but it really is part of what the father
08:04
wants us to do he wants us to reach out
08:06
to be kind to care
08:08
which um obviously the left cares for
08:10
nothing but we do we have to we we
08:12
follow jesus christ and you know he
08:15
helped he fed the people everywhere he
08:16
went he would they did he would give
08:18
them water and so that is just a normal
08:21
thing to do as a believer is to reach
08:23
out and help people so i am really
08:26
um excited about what y'all are it's
08:28
just you know i just haven't had this
08:30
much fun
08:31
years and people might have heard me say
08:33
it was 1987 where god spoke to me in the
08:35
middle of night and he said well
08:37
ministries and then he said little
08:39
orphan children now they're not all
08:41
orphans but they're all children yeah
08:43
and um
08:44
it's in and then finally so whatever
08:46
that was 30 some years and then we
08:49
finally got to obey the word of the lord
08:51
but
08:52
maybe i should have started before that
08:54
but uh and when i had that word we were
08:56
pretty darn poor i was just telling my
08:58
step about yeah i think he was just
09:00
talking about the future steve what you
09:02
know
09:03
you're part of the prophetic that's what
09:04
happens he'll say something to you it
09:07
could be 10 20 30. there's things he
09:10
showed me 45 years ago that we're just
09:12
not stepping into but i knew it would
09:14
always happen it's like i never stopped
09:16
believing
09:18
like you there's no way it could happen
09:20
back then anyway
09:22
we were trying to just eat back then in
09:24
those days you know growing up but you
09:26
know what even trying to eat ourselves
09:28
we still shared with other people
09:30
and uh we were always continually
09:32
getting blessed we we had basic stuff
09:35
probably but we were so happy that we
09:37
loved helping people and we would take
09:39
even in the 60s when the there were all
09:42
the flop houses where the
09:43
the young people would gather to take
09:45
drugs my dad would take big pots of stew
09:47
and soon
09:48
and they'd always let you come if you're
09:50
going to feed him then he'd cheer jesus
09:52
and some of those very people turned up
09:54
to be revivalists and evangelists in
09:56
these days wow so you never know like
09:59
what you're helping the ones you're
10:00
helping there you never know what
10:02
they're or who they're going to become
10:04
for god so you're seating in the lives
10:07
of future
10:08
leaders probably in the world right now
10:12
that's just so amazing we had another
10:14
place in uganda that did contact us and
10:17
we're looking at that as a as a
10:19
secondary place to to drill wells so um
10:23
god's really got our our focus on these
10:25
wells um you know it's just so amazing
10:28
because you see every single well
10:31
and uh lori wrote to me the other day
10:32
and she said already through these wells
10:35
that you saw on that map thousands of
10:37
people are using that one and a thousand
10:39
she said so
10:41
it's just
10:42
you can tell i'm excited about it you
10:43
can really tell that i'm
10:45
too because you know growing up with my
10:48
dad who he was
10:50
sir he touched probably probably
10:53
hundreds of thousands of people in his
10:54
lifetime
10:56
dropping them and i mean we would we
10:58
would really help people that were
10:59
abandoned or or
11:02
something
11:03
and we would work with them sometimes a
11:05
couple of years getting them a place
11:06
getting them clothes i mean we would
11:08
give our own stuff away even though we
11:09
didn't have
11:10
and we i actually still carry that on
11:13
now in my own life if people need
11:15
something sometimes my husband have to
11:17
get used to i say go get us go find a
11:20
truck get a rental truck and we take our
11:22
almost a half a household of our
11:24
furniture
11:25
somebody who had none and we didn't give
11:27
them the old beat up stuff we gave them
11:30
the brand new stuff and i my heart would
11:32
just be so excited and so happy that we
11:35
got to make a difference so i i
11:37
understand what that is like it truly is
11:39
truly truly is more blessed to give
11:42
than receive it's like they're enjoying
11:44
that so much and we're enjoying it a
11:46
whole lot more if it can be
11:48
possible so
11:49
well kathleen you know we're in amazing
11:52
times this even seems like an amazing
11:54
month amazing week amazing day and what
11:57
what's on your heart to share about
11:59
current events before we get into
12:00
questions every day things are changing
12:03
and i'm telling you no matter what
12:04
you're hearing in other news sources
12:07
it's all downhill for the left i just
12:10
have to say the truth you know i'm
12:12
always going to tell the truth besides
12:14
what the father son and holy spirit are
12:15
sharing with me personally that they
12:17
showed me months and months ago
12:20
is happening right now
12:22
they're not going to tell you uh who is
12:25
who is coming forward to be witnesses
12:26
they're not going to give a lot of that
12:28
out until the hammer really falls on all
12:30
of them but i can tell you the
12:32
foundation is totally getting into
12:34
crumbles right now
12:36
and every time this is a sign you can
12:38
tell when they start adding insane
12:41
things i'm talking about the laugh and
12:43
they start adding insane things on their
12:45
list of to do uh you know they're
12:47
desperate
12:48
because you know why they're adding new
12:50
stuff that is dangerous or that is
12:52
criminal activity the other stuff is not
12:54
working
12:56
yeah
12:56
no hell cannot create anything good it
12:59
just gets worse and worse that's what
13:01
happens when you give yourself into the
13:02
darkness it only gets worse and worse
13:04
people there's never going to be any
13:06
better or good in any of that uh evil is
13:09
not good okay
13:11
yeah
13:12
it is bad and this is the worst thing
13:15
you could be involved in but more and
13:17
more people are standing up the everyday
13:19
um citizen
13:21
not just in america but even canada as
13:23
you well know yeah people are watching
13:25
those truckers and
13:27
uh we did have something very
13:28
significant happened since our last
13:31
broadcast
13:32
that you all know about the caravan the
13:34
convoy
13:36
that has gone across to the country of
13:38
canada well god says north american
13:41
continent that has gone uh from there
13:43
it's header thing to ottawa or or way
13:46
over to the from going from the
13:48
west to the east area in canada and uh
13:51
there's tens of thousands of truckers
13:54
people in case they're lying to you
13:55
about it i know they've heard from their
13:58
um their leader uh who's never going to
14:01
tell you the truth either you know not
14:03
even in canada their leader is not going
14:05
to tell the truth and they've been
14:06
putting up with him for a long time
14:08
because i know i have a lot of friends
14:10
in canada and they've always been not
14:11
just complaining but fed up with the
14:14
illegal regulations and laws he's been
14:17
making
14:18
and uh so this convoy really was quite a
14:21
shock to him he didn't expect this
14:23
backlash against all of his stuff that
14:25
he's saying
14:26
people tend to want to be free
14:29
and they're fed up with what's going on
14:31
and so this convoy started with just a
14:33
few hundred trucks i i forgot close to
14:36
like fifty thousand that sounds like
14:38
insane right but that is really what's
14:40
going on and they've gone across all of
14:42
canada and people are coming out
14:46
by the dozens if not hundreds in some
14:48
places to feed these truckers i mean
14:51
wherever they stop like for the night or
14:53
if they take a break people are there
14:54
with food with supplies
14:58
bringing gas and i mean it's just
15:00
craziness to see what a good crazy uh to
15:03
see how these people are pulling
15:04
together because they know these
15:06
truckers are not just there representing
15:08
them they're representing the people in
15:10
canada and the people are with them
15:13
because they know this is for their good
15:16
well the the t person
15:20
their leader that i don't know what's
15:22
gone wrong with his brain either he made
15:24
a decision i'm going to do something
15:26
this is just got to stop it's got to
15:27
stop so he contacted all these big
15:30
industries that had this massive um like
15:33
commercial grade tractors when i say
15:34
tractor on commercial grade tractors he
15:37
was going to send them all to this line
15:39
of this big convoy and begin to bust it
15:41
up and break it up because when people
15:43
get united it is very dangerous
15:46
[Laughter]
15:47
you didn't like this whole picture
15:49
because you know people have they have
15:51
their cell phones and they can't hide
15:52
the truth of being shown
15:54
and of what's really going on they're
15:56
making a stand for their freedom and so
15:59
he decided i'll stop this right now and
16:02
i forgot how many hundreds of these huge
16:05
massive tractors he contacted these
16:06
commercial farmers said you will go
16:08
there you will bust this thing up and
16:11
end it and so all these massive tractors
16:14
came up alongside where the convoy was
16:17
and instead of making them get out and
16:19
and stop or either take their stuff or
16:21
make them move they got out and stood
16:23
alongside them
16:27
and said we are together with you that
16:30
is freaking out their leader now what is
16:32
he gonna do now right uh they're saying
16:34
we're making a stand too we want to be
16:36
free too so we're not forcing them to
16:38
end this we're a part of it
16:40
[Laughter]
16:42
oh man isn't it fun watching people get
16:45
united you know and when you get united
16:47
against egypt you know what this i know
16:50
was a god thing because let me tell you
16:51
there are praying people in canada yeah
16:54
i was told a long time ago don't go
16:55
there it's dark when i'm sorry
16:57
everywhere i went i saw light light in
16:59
the people light and regions there uh
17:02
they've had some very important people
17:04
just come from the area and bring the
17:06
truth many many places in america too
17:09
uh but they're making a stand and when
17:11
it only takes one or two people to
17:13
finally stand and say we're not having
17:15
this anymore we're doing something about
17:17
it we're going to let them know we're
17:19
not afraid of them we're making a stand
17:21
we are going to be free and and now that
17:24
stand is just increased because instead
17:26
of sending someone against them to stop
17:28
it they are joining them knowing from
17:31
the very moment that they got that
17:33
called this is what you will do oh they
17:35
went there but they're not making them
17:37
stop so i'm celebrating all of you uh
17:40
farmers and people in canada who came
17:43
alongside the the they their people
17:46
there
17:46
to bring freedom to all them i
17:48
congratulate you and celebrate
17:50
awesome and you know i'm hearing that
17:53
this is about to um be released the
17:55
truckers in the united states i
17:57
understand that this is just a rumor but
17:59
the rumor is on super bowl sunday which
18:02
is this sunday that after the super bowl
18:04
the truckers are going to start from in
18:05
l.a heading back east so if that's true
18:09
we're about to witness uh probably
18:12
what canada is doing even in an increase
18:14
even more so
18:16
um because the the population is greater
18:18
in the united states so they can do more
18:20
so
18:21
and you're right they are really trying
18:23
they're they're trying their best not to
18:24
interrupt you but i'm so excited they're
18:27
trying to keep as much as possible
18:29
undercover
18:31
you know so you know the left knows as
18:33
little as possible about what their
18:35
plans are and let me tell you they've
18:37
learned how to communicate with each
18:38
other really well it will be
18:41
massive that's all i can say
18:43
it will be mind-blowing to see how many
18:46
of them and i do know this along the way
18:50
which you're going to figure that anyway
18:51
more will be added but to think from if
18:54
from california to dc
18:56
you're going to see this american convoy
18:59
and this is the greatest part
19:02
other uh nationalities
19:04
in this country are also involved in
19:06
this trucking convoy it isn't just you
19:09
know we the white people in america yes
19:12
we the black people the hispanic people
19:14
you know the ones from india whoever
19:16
wherever they are that they want freedom
19:18
are already and they have had time the
19:21
american ones have had time to super
19:24
plan ahead of time the feeding stations
19:26
the places where they'll get their fuel
19:29
um they may even stop and and have bull
19:31
horns and say some stuff i know even
19:34
people are getting ready to stand along
19:36
the
19:37
is like they did in canada
19:39
and probably a line hold streets in
19:42
cities so you know they're going to show
19:44
them what they think about our fake
19:47
leadership in dc they're going to show
19:48
them what they think they're done with
19:50
it we are done with that and we know
19:52
that whole thing is crumbling even
19:54
though if they won't tell that truth one
19:56
day it will it will be told and it will
19:58
have to be told on the news there will
20:00
be no other no other
20:02
choice for them to do that
20:04
the freedom has already begun and i know
20:07
god had said watch the first three
20:09
months of this year yeah and you'll see
20:12
great things happening that will begin
20:13
to bring hope and joy not just hope but
20:16
joy into your heart so uh keep the
20:18
celebration going
20:20
and now you can visibly see things
20:22
happening that there's no way you can
20:24
hide okay you can't hide a hundred
20:26
thousand two hundred thousand people's
20:28
activities going across these different
20:30
areas in canada and in america so you
20:33
can see what has started there is now
20:36
coming down here in our country
20:38
and uh so this is this is our stand for
20:40
freedom people so make sure you're
20:42
praying for all of them pray for every
20:44
one of them protection uh of course
20:47
provision and supply it will bring hope
20:50
and joy into the hearts of everyone who
20:52
is there as it passes you know as it
20:54
passes by if they come to your city make
20:57
sure you get out there in the streets
20:58
and let them know that you're standing
21:00
with them and thank them for their for
21:02
their own stand totally totally you know
21:04
it's kind of fun but i think it was the
21:06
late 70s they had that famous song about
21:08
the trucker convoy that's when cb radios
21:11
took off and they had this famous song
21:14
and then that star goes folks i think we
21:16
got ourselves a convoy breaker breaker
21:19
one nine right or something like that
21:21
and and i heard that in canada i don't
21:23
know if they tried to shut off the
21:25
the cell phones or whatever but of
21:26
course truckers use cb radios anyway
21:29
but but other people were buying were
21:31
going out and buying cd radios so they
21:33
could communicate with the truckers
21:35
without the need
21:37
without the need for the cell phones
21:38
because you just as long as you're in
21:40
range you can talk to any of the
21:41
truckers all at the same time
21:45
back in the day when my husband's
21:47
parents lived in ohio
21:49
um my husband actually got one one of
21:51
those radios as we go up the west
21:53
virginia turnpike uh you could talk to
21:56
anybody any of the truckers if you
21:57
needed help they needed help you heard
22:00
them have conversation all the way up
22:02
day or night and so that's what he's
22:04
talking about they have their own
22:05
antennas that they operate from they
22:07
don't need to sell power they don't need
22:09
a uh they don't need a networks to be
22:11
involved right right you can't stop
22:13
those conversations people i know people
22:16
that have them in their homes and just
22:18
for fun with having to talk to all the
22:19
truckers
22:20
yeah if you got one drag it out and
22:22
clean it up
22:24
yeah to come out and say hello
22:27
as the college age which i was at that
22:29
time you would be bizarre if you didn't
22:32
have a cd radio in your car it was that
22:34
big of a deal you know and yeah you'd
22:36
learn to use it and people get on your
22:38
case if you didn't say your call signs
22:40
or your handle or whatever yes see so
22:42
they were doing that people long before
22:44
the cell phones came along yeah we
22:46
didn't have that yet people had a way to
22:48
communicate didn't they stephen now
22:49
they're going down
22:51
it was fun those were fun days so i
22:53
don't know whatever happened i guess i
22:55
sold it with the car but well let's see
22:57
i guess we'll get into some questions
22:59
about heaven and heaven related things
23:01
so for anyone that's new cat's been to
23:03
heaven uh literally thousands of times
23:06
over the last 20 30 years um is that
23:08
about right am i saying that right
23:11
it's past 20 years so you know after a
23:13
while you kind of lose count but
23:15
um yeah it has been over 20 years since
23:18
um and by the way if jesus came in
23:20
person everybody came in person and told
23:22
me uh the father and his plans about
23:25
taking me to heaven to reveal heaven to
23:27
earth like never before so you know the
23:29
truth about it he said it would dispel
23:32
the fear of death uh and that has
23:34
totally done that with so many people
23:36
but it would also let you know
23:38
for you there
23:40
and uh it is my great pleasure uh to
23:43
step out in obedience to the father i
23:45
didn't
23:46
ask and i always say this this was not
23:48
my plan and i never asked for it i just
23:50
always gave the father what he wanted i
23:52
would obey as much as i possibly could
23:54
whatever he asked me to do in the small
23:56
things so don't despise the small things
23:59
people he trained me by saying you'll
24:01
fly to this airport and and when you go
24:04
into the concourse where the food
24:06
station is you will give this person
24:07
dressed like this this message from me
24:10
and i had to just go i mean i flew uh
24:13
one time to minneapolis
24:16
to the airport there and i had this very
24:18
important message it was just grab on a
24:20
little piece of paper said i'll give you
24:21
the message when you get on the plane
24:23
this is stepping in faith okay
24:25
i did it in faith yes i paid for it out
24:27
of my own pocket
24:28
and when i got to the full court there
24:30
was the guy dressed exactly like he said
24:32
in a blue mechanic's uh outfit
24:35
and uh he said when he bows his head to
24:37
pray over his food you will run up and
24:40
say this is god's answer
24:42
and then you have to turn around and
24:43
leave wow so i wrote his answer on this
24:46
piece of paper it was about some new
24:48
invention and he was telling him yes he
24:50
was going in the right direction with it
24:51
was so profound but i didn't really
24:53
understand that uh and i had to race to
24:55
catch my plane back i flew gave the
24:57
message
24:59
so when he asks you to do things like
25:01
that that makes no sense to your natural
25:03
mind god doesn't ever have to make sense
25:06
he's god
25:07
and things he's doing right now that you
25:10
don't understand or see it might not
25:12
make sense to you but he has a reason
25:14
for doing things you just have to follow
25:17
and do what he asked so that's how he
25:18
trained me to do these things to hear
25:21
him uh exactly and distinctly and then
25:24
he would start catching me up to heaven
25:25
and showing me places and i have a
25:27
photographic memory so when i tell you
25:28
this is what i saw it's what i saw if i
25:31
told you this is what i heard it's what
25:33
i heard if i if i helped felt amazing
25:36
emotions or i smelled aromas or tasted
25:39
the food that's exactly what happened to
25:41
me so you're getting an eyewitness not
25:44
just an assumed report this is not an
25:46
assume report this is eyewitness
25:49
accounts
25:50
uh
25:51
excuse me give me get a drink yeah go
25:53
for the dream
25:56
ivanis accounts on purpose planned
25:59
by the father son and holy spirit to
26:01
reveal their home the father's house is
26:05
a world called heaven it is not just a
26:08
building and he's preparing a place for
26:11
you that you can be there with him if
26:12
you're born again believer if you don't
26:14
know jesus you better get on that train
26:17
because it's the only way there
26:20
yeah wow okay well wow wow wow cat all
26:23
right let's jump into some questions now
26:25
a lot of the questions related to heaven
26:28
or
26:29
heaven related stuff like you said pets
26:32
god takes your pets to heaven which i
26:34
love we just had to put our kitty down
26:36
last week or the week before but kat
26:39
because you had told us about that our
26:41
pets go to heaven because you had
26:43
described what happens because you had
26:44
said you're doing them a favor when
26:46
they're really sick and they're in pain
26:48
and this kitty was in terrible pain and
26:50
his kidneys shut down suddenly
26:52
you know we just knew we had done this
26:54
kitty a favor
26:55
and it's a little bit hard even so but
26:57
still you know you just ushered them
26:59
into the presence of the lord what is
27:01
the cat what is that animal's experience
27:04
i don't even know how to even ask that
27:06
question or if you would even know how
27:07
to answer it what is it what does an
27:09
animal experience when they suddenly
27:12
do you know has the lord ever showed me
27:13
anything like that what they experienced
27:15
actually uh quite a few times has
27:18
happened since
27:19
we have always had a lot of pets and
27:21
right now of course we rescue cats we
27:23
have cats everywhere yeah but um ma we
27:26
used to have yorkies um one while i was
27:29
married this is like over the last 20
27:30
years we've had yorkies my mom had one i
27:32
had one um they think they're people
27:35
they don't know their dogs
27:37
and uh and we love them very much but
27:40
eventually they get very old and you
27:42
know
27:43
i had kept mine beyond the time they had
27:47
appointed times they were supposed to
27:48
leave leave for heaven and i kept mine
27:50
and kept saying no you're going to stay
27:52
and not go
27:53
and the poor little dog got like blind
27:56
and weak and already moved
27:58
and finally my family come they said we
28:01
don't think she'll last you get back and
28:02
god said i'll let her last but you're
28:04
gonna let her go
28:07
and so uh so um i did i said well i
28:10
promise that if you let last time get
28:13
back and say goodbye then i will release
28:14
her to you and it did happen when they
28:17
when they pass
28:19
just like we do their spiritual body
28:21
that looks just like them steps out of
28:23
their fleshy body
28:26
i firmly believe that on the day the
28:28
dead in christ will rise
28:30
they will give their bodies back to you
28:32
because they are living in heaven your
28:34
own guardian angel my own guardian angel
28:37
took my yorkie to heaven and when she
28:40
stepped out of that that physical body
28:43
and she had stopped breathing there she
28:45
was
28:45
and my angel just grabbed her up and
28:48
took her up to heaven i have seen her in
28:50
heaven several times when i was there
28:52
just enjoying herself playing and games
28:55
and stuff with other pets that are up
28:57
there but they experience uh more more
29:00
so i think for them it's easy they don't
29:02
in their head have to figure out what
29:03
just happened to me they know they're
29:05
not hurt they're not sick you know
29:07
they're not and they're not infirmed
29:09
anymore they can run jump and play
29:12
because they also look younger if they
29:14
were if you're if your pet was really
29:16
well i never thought of it that way yeah
29:18
it's just like us when you could be 99
29:20
when you pass but you look like you're
29:22
in your 20s you're like 20s when you
29:24
step out of this physical body i
29:26
literally have been with people when
29:28
they passed and
29:29
i knew it was them stepping out of their
29:31
body and their angels waiting would
29:33
reach their hand out if you had loved
29:36
ones that you were with and they were
29:37
about to pass and they reached out that
29:38
was probably to take their angel's hand
29:41
that was going to be escorting them back
29:42
to heaven but the same thing with the
29:44
pets except that your own angel
29:47
takes your pet up to heaven to your
29:49
mansion that's being built and they know
29:51
that's their home now they know that's
29:52
their new home and if you had other pets
29:55
go they're gonna be with those other
29:56
pets enjoying yourself so they're happy
29:59
and i think the most amazing time
30:03
uh that i experienced all this was my
30:05
mom's little yorkie who jen and i took
30:08
he couldn't hardly move or breathe
30:10
anymore and my mom of course was like i
30:12
don't think i can take when jenna and i
30:13
go we'll take him so we took him to our
30:16
our family vet and took him in and we
30:19
stayed with him the whole time
30:21
and they gave them just a real simple
30:23
shot so he kind of went to sleep and
30:25
eventually he passed and he jumped out
30:28
of his body
30:29
yeah you could see it because you're a
30:31
seer you actually watched it happen you
30:34
actually watched it happen yes and then
30:36
and then when i saw that i
30:39
turned again and i said that the father
30:41
said run outside
30:43
and he said get your camera ready run
30:44
outside so i ran outside the vet and we
30:47
have a photograph of that dog's
30:49
spiritual body
30:51
heading towards heaven it is so him he
30:54
had the point his ears you know yorkie
30:56
you fixed the ears of the stand up he
30:57
had really high pointy ears and he was
31:00
really quite cute and it was a spiritual
31:02
body look just like him but younger and
31:04
i got pictures to come back and say look
31:07
mom he's on his way home to heaven and
31:10
she
31:10
was still rejoicing
31:12
we will be doing i'm just going to leak
31:14
it out right now don't ask us when it'll
31:16
be done we will be doing because i know
31:18
all of my stuff is going to say why'd
31:20
you do that because i'm going to give
31:21
you all hope and joy
31:23
our next calendar will be about pets
31:26
good good good
31:28
pets in heaven pets in the clouds that
31:30
we've gotten pictures of pictures of our
31:32
own pets it will make everyone rejoice
31:35
god said it'd be one of the most
31:36
favorite calendars we ever make there'll
31:38
be a little story with it but you'll see
31:41
either picture
31:42
of them in the sky literally in the
31:44
spiritual body and that that that dog's
31:46
picture will be in the calendar when we
31:49
make it so god is adamant about letting
31:52
you know your pets go to heaven so
31:55
i've already just broken the
31:57
hidden thing now that's good okay so
32:02
it's going to be so much fun making that
32:03
calendar with so many memories yeah i
32:05
want one i want one
32:09
my artist is going to do a rendering of
32:11
my dad walking along part of his ranch
32:14
with all of our pets from the time we
32:16
were growing little
32:18
walking behind him on his property that
32:20
will be one of the scenes in the
32:22
calendar so have you is that an actual
32:24
scene you've seen in him i saw in heaven
32:27
i actually saw that scene in heaven uh
32:29
uh he god caught me up to my father's
32:31
ranch my dad didn't see me or even talk
32:34
to me but i saw him i could identify the
32:37
pets i had when i was a little girl and
32:40
i tell the story when we lived in new
32:42
york we weren't allowed to have pets
32:44
where we live but they had resident mice
32:46
there
32:48
we made friends with the residents and
32:50
we taught them how to jump off the
32:52
curtain rod onto our shoulders these
32:54
little tiny mice i saw them in heaven
32:56
writing on the back of another one of
32:58
our pets that we had so
33:00
it could be a really cute story that
33:02
goes with that but that was an actual
33:04
eyewitness account i saw my brothers uh
33:06
i go on the iggy i saw my brother's
33:08
alligator you hear me talk about all the
33:10
time charlie was in this long line of
33:12
pets so
33:13
god was showing me yes i mean it when
33:15
they go to heaven so i have seen all of
33:18
these pets plus uh the couple other uh
33:20
encounters i had but but i have amazing
33:24
photographs that we took
33:26
and let me tell you every time we take
33:28
them to officemax to get printed the
33:30
people freak out because they know we
33:31
didn't generate that
33:33
i'm doing good to use my cell phone i
33:35
don't know how to make anything online
33:38
uh so i don't get to see most messages
33:41
and stuff like that and like that's why
33:43
i have tech people yeah
33:45
but none of these photographs that we
33:46
put in the calendar will be doctored up
33:48
in any way they'll be the real deal and
33:51
quite surprised and delighted so your
33:54
pets are enjoying themselves awesome
33:56
okay well along that line uh about uh
33:58
paul is asking he said we had to put my
34:00
dog down a week after my 21st birthday
34:03
since then i've been having dreams
34:05
regularly where he is with me and is not
34:08
dead is the lord
34:10
possibly allowing him to visit me
34:12
interesting question
34:14
either that or he's just catching you up
34:16
while you're sleeping
34:18
oh wow that's even better
34:20
that has actually happened many times to
34:23
people
34:24
usually within maybe the first year or
34:26
two of someone a pet passing they have
34:29
actually been caught up to certain like
34:31
there's this field they are taken to or
34:34
someplace by the crystal sea sometimes
34:36
they're walking with their with their
34:37
pet on the beach of the crystal sea
34:39
uh but a lot of them are in this
34:41
beautiful meadow there's meadows there
34:44
it's near butterfly field which is an
34:46
actual place in heaven where all the
34:47
butterflies will fly and attach
34:48
themselves and they'll sing nice
34:51
in heaven this isn't heaven i'm talking
34:53
about um but you know i don't i don't
34:55
know myself of them but i'm not saying
34:57
they couldn't appear i'm not saying i
34:59
know they can't come back and live i
35:01
just want to clarify that well i mean
35:02
even i'm not going to come back from
35:04
heaven and live with you okay
35:06
number one they wouldn't want to leave
35:08
heaven yeah
35:10
well it's even a better to me uh um it's
35:13
even a bad
35:25
that is what you're saying right
35:27
uh well you broke up when you just said
35:29
that so okay so when when he dreams that
35:32
the the animals visiting him and he's
35:34
alive and it feels real you're saying he
35:37
might be being caught up himself to
35:38
visit his animal
35:40
yes absolutely wow okay all right next
35:43
question can your grandchild's guardian
35:45
angel
35:47
and the holy spirit oh can you ask your
35:49
grandchild's guardian angel and the holy
35:52
spirit to help keep her or him in the
35:54
knowledge of what their purpose is in
35:55
life
35:56
while they're still in the womb
35:58
and as they grow up so there's i guess
36:00
there's can you ask the holy spirit and
36:03
their angel to do things like that make
36:06
them
36:07
walk the straight path i guess i don't
36:08
know
36:10
well i don't know what they mean how far
36:12
along they're growing up because
36:13
eventually everybody does have to make a
36:15
choice yeah but absolutely um i would
36:18
say like my grandchildren are being
36:20
trained by their parents my my my
36:23
children my
36:24
son-in-law my daughter
36:26
um i had three girls and they're
36:29
training them how to hear holy spirit
36:32
okay and some of them actually have seen
36:34
their guardian angels and um so they're
36:37
they're they're they're called to be in
36:39
ministry in some form or shape of
36:41
ministry or to be out there to be known
36:42
and seeing they are
36:44
and so that's something put in their
36:46
heart now god will put it in their heart
36:49
it may not be visible or known at the
36:51
time
36:52
some come out um as soon as they start
36:54
speaking they might start saying things
36:56
about god i'm just saying get ready for
36:58
these generations of children being born
37:00
now to do that more so than in the past
37:03
uh
37:03
but i'm pretty sure the angel continues
37:06
to talk to them that's why they're here
37:08
the guardian angel will try to influence
37:10
them to do what's right and not wrong
37:12
or to to ask for forgiveness i mean uh
37:15
that's what your guardian angel is there
37:17
they're garden protect your soul
37:19
as well as them and so i'm quite sure
37:22
that they've been given guidelines by
37:24
god when they're sent at the time of
37:26
conception
37:27
that is when your guardian angels are
37:29
sent
37:30
so life begins at conception people i
37:34
know the angels show up and they'll be
37:36
waiting outside the mother for that baby
37:38
to be born so they can start speaking
37:40
things of god they sing to the babies
37:42
you can't hear them and that's many
37:45
times a little baby is looking all over
37:47
the room they're seeing the angels
37:49
whenever mine they bring mine here and
37:52
where i live to visit me they're always
37:55
looking at the angels and of course i
37:57
see their angels with them so they're
38:00
not going to leave those those children
38:01
but in the womb you have to understand
38:05
if anything was spoken by the father
38:06
holy spirit it would be planted in their
38:08
spirit somewhere because they are little
38:10
babies and even jesus as inside the womb
38:14
of mary had to grow and begin to learn
38:17
now he learned the normal things to
38:19
learn even as a little child but at one
38:22
point he knew he was the son of god
38:24
all know the story about the caravan
38:27
where he came of age and he in the
38:29
father then revealed himself and he knew
38:32
that he was about the father's business
38:34
that would be his father in heaven and
38:36
and from that moment on he was different
38:38
but up until then i think he probably
38:40
had to learn like we did instead he
38:42
faced every every kind of temptation or
38:45
trial or whatever that we ourselves have
38:48
had to face in our lives so even growing
38:50
up he had to learn how to be nice kind
38:52
polite i'm quite sure that joseph taught
38:54
him a lot of those things himself you
38:57
know the normal natural things but as
38:59
far as god imparting and speaking that
39:01
happens even when children are young my
39:04
children heard at a very early age at
39:07
three one of them started being caught
39:08
up in heaven and shown things
39:10
and uh they god still speaks to this one
39:13
grandchild he speaks a lot to the other
39:15
one so
39:16
if you're praying for them to know jesus
39:18
christ and not mr destiny that's very
39:22
important but make sure when you speak
39:23
to them yourself
39:25
don't be harsh i just have to say this
39:28
is the truth
39:29
don't yell don't yell and holler out in
39:31
your house when your baby's born you try
39:33
to keep an atmosphere of peace and joy
39:36
as much as you can
39:37
you don't want to cause distractions
39:41
in the soul or even in the natural
39:42
nature of that baby you know babies when
39:44
they're sung to when they're loved they
39:46
just grow up differently themselves and
39:48
ones who are in a household where people
39:49
are always fighting and screaming
39:51
so if at all possible
39:54
and i will tell people all the time
39:56
don't you feel like you gotta fight go
39:58
outside pray first before you talk to
40:00
each other i'm talking to the husband
40:01
and wife you pray loose all of the
40:03
wounds ask for grace from god and then
40:06
have a conversation with them because
40:09
you don't want to impart um
40:11
uh a feelings or things into your little
40:14
child growing up
40:16
that's why kids usually get into crime
40:18
their parents were either in crime or
40:20
they didn't treat them very well but god
40:22
is adamantly told me to make sure that
40:24
i'm saying to all the ones who are
40:26
related to me make sure that you have
40:29
peace in your household that when you
40:30
talk to your children you can still
40:32
correct them but don't scream and yell
40:34
and make them feel degraded it is not
40:37
good for that child if my mom was
40:39
sitting next to me she'd be sitting
40:41
right here uh uh nodding her head yeah
40:45
so it is important the atmosphere you
40:47
create and i know sometimes there's a
40:49
situation where you're not married to
40:50
someone who's nice at all make sure you
40:52
have time for that child to encourage
40:54
them and i will say this and this is
40:57
true
40:57
you as a watcher over their soul because
41:00
that's who you are you're raising a soul
41:02
in the kingdom
41:04
adam was called a living soul because
41:06
that's your whole inside that's what you
41:07
think you choose then your emotions are
41:09
displayed if they have seen or witnessed
41:12
something when the other person leaves
41:15
you lay your hand on their head and say
41:16
as a watcher over their soul i choose
41:19
with my will to lose all of the trauma
41:21
of the harsh words the profanity uh
41:25
anything that would hurt my child
41:27
someone anyway i loose it in jesus name
41:29
and guess what jesus will come and take
41:31
all that stuff out of that child i tell
41:34
people if you adopt kids who are in very
41:36
abusive situations you really need to do
41:39
that lay your hand on their head and say
41:40
as a watcher of their soul i choose my
41:42
will to lose trauma abuse that happened
41:45
even in the past harsh unkind words you
41:48
know any words the enemy loose it out of
41:50
their soul and jesus will come pull it
41:53
out and then it can't affect their
41:54
future and confine the love and the life
41:57
of god to them
41:58
in the past we didn't know all this we
42:00
knew of course that we would pray this
42:02
is a very high level of prayer
42:05
to declare a decree but you're really
42:07
using the keys to the kingdom that i
42:10
give you the keys to the kingdom okay
42:12
and it's about binding and losing
42:17
if somebody bullied your kid at school
42:18
whatever you do when they come home lay
42:20
your hand in their head said i choose my
42:22
will to lose all the bullying the
42:24
meanness any hate uh any abuse out of my
42:28
child's soul and i've had testimonies
42:30
from parents that did that and it was
42:32
like it never happened wow
42:35
wow cat okay let me ask you this
42:37
question you talked about um
42:39
uh wasn't what wasn't the question but i
42:41
really wanted to key in on this because
42:43
you said you talked about jesus learning
42:45
as a child he had to learn there's a
42:47
scripture in king james that says he and
42:49
he learned obedience by the things he
42:51
suffered and i always said that was an
42:53
odd scripture that jesus learned
42:55
obedience by the things he suffered is
42:57
there any more detail you can
42:59
uh yeah
43:01
he learned he learned obedience because
43:03
there were consequences
43:05
yeah i'm sure if he said something sharp
43:07
or harsh himself while he was growing up
43:10
uh that he got corrected i'm sure that
43:13
uh even god has given given a dynamics
43:16
of how to raise a child and that is with
43:19
affection
43:20
um correction and direction and i'm sure
43:23
you need all three of those when you're
43:24
raising up children i'm sure joseph and
43:27
mary both employed that
43:29
with jesus especially mary knowing that
43:32
he had a powerful call on his life and
43:35
so he learned that there would be
43:36
consequences i'm not saying when he was
43:38
older and he already knew that he
43:39
belonged to the father but i'm saying
43:41
before that time you know if he did
43:43
something he shouldn't have done
43:44
something i'm quite sure that mary and
43:46
joseph both had consequences for him and
43:49
he did so in other words the things he
43:51
went through and learned there's going
43:53
to be consequences
43:54
and he did grow and also there's a
43:56
scripture that i love
43:58
as he walked in obedience to his parents
44:00
and honored his parents and i promise
44:02
you he just jesus honored joseph as the
44:05
one who raised him and mary as you know
44:08
his mother he honored them and there's
44:10
promises but in luke 2 52
44:14
this is my favorite scripture and jesus
44:17
because they've been walking in
44:18
obedience and learning how to live jesus
44:22
increase
44:23
in wisdom and stature and favor with god
44:28
and man that's good
44:30
so that is what will result in your own
44:33
child when you raise them with
44:35
consequences you know and you have those
44:37
three things affection direction or
44:40
affection correction and direction uh
44:43
then that will be the result that your
44:44
child will increase in wisdom that's
44:47
understanding right knowing and stature
44:50
that means his integrity uh his personal
44:53
character
44:55
and favor
44:57
now you have to see because of his
44:58
obedience he got favor
45:00
not just with god but with man so 252
45:03
you should write that down and remember
45:05
that when you're declaring over your
45:07
child and and cat on this
45:10
you know the scripture is very cl plain
45:12
that he uh clear that
45:14
that he he was attempted in all points
45:17
and yet without sin
45:18
is it possible that before he became
45:21
that 12 year old or 13 year old boy he
45:23
did sin in the sense of he had to be
45:26
corrected with something or how do you
45:28
explain that
45:29
steve
45:32
you don't always get corrupted for sin
45:34
okay
45:35
uh
45:36
they did they made a not a good decision
45:38
that wasn't necessarily sin right okay
45:40
sin is rejecting we know the basic of
45:43
basis of sin is rejecting jesus christ
45:46
and then you get into areas where you
45:48
you
45:49
there's a there's an age of
45:50
accountability
45:52
nobody knows that age god
45:54
from that point on you have grace and
45:58
you can have correction from your
45:59
parents
46:00
um to go in the right direction
46:03
but maybe it was something that was
46:04
didn't please his parents or maybe he
46:06
shouldn't have done that didn't make it
46:07
a sin
46:08
so there's a difference in the sin and
46:10
not making good decisions that's good so
46:13
i think the consequences jesus faced as
46:15
growing up would be not good decisions
46:18
okay i don't think he outright sin
46:20
because he said without sin right yeah
46:22
he faced it all even as an adult but he
46:25
didn't sin so we weren't talking about
46:30
when you got corrected you know when you
46:31
make wrong decisions that's how you
46:33
learn not to get into sin later that's
46:35
really good remember how to stay on the
46:37
right path when you walk in obedience
46:39
and honor to those who are over you you
46:41
know uh then you already learn how to
46:44
walk on that path and then you yourself
46:46
can have integrity like luke 252 so i'm
46:49
not ever saying he outright sin because
46:52
it didn't live without it but being
46:55
young and immature you know
46:58
we do make mistakes and our parents have
47:00
to drag us back in line and and give us
47:03
correction and direction that's the most
47:05
important part the direction
47:06
um but don't forget affection that's
47:09
good that's the best explanation i've
47:11
heard on that uh totally that's totally
47:13
totally yeah i know a lot of people that
47:16
was totally from the father affection uh
47:18
correction and direction you can't leave
47:20
one of them out you will not have a full
47:22
rounded child if you do nothing to give
47:25
direction all the time and correction
47:27
they're not going to know how to love
47:29
that you're leaving the love out but you
47:30
can't just have affection and direction
47:32
and not have corruption they'll think
47:35
that you that that the world owes them
47:37
everything
47:38
and they won't consider other people and
47:40
you can't even just have affection and
47:42
correction and not direction they won't
47:43
even know what to do and i've seen some
47:46
kids raised that way they couldn't make
47:47
decisions on how to save how to look for
47:49
a job so you need all three the father
47:52
gave this he said this guess what this
47:54
is how the father operates with us
47:56
affection
47:57
correction
47:59
and direction nice yeah
48:01
good okay now let me ask a question you
48:03
i know you and manuel
48:05
johnson each tell many stories about or
48:07
several stories where god has taken you
48:10
to the future not showing you the future
48:12
taking you there
48:14
and then he's also taking you back in
48:16
time and you didn't you weren't shown
48:18
that you were actually there bobby
48:19
connor talks about being at the
48:21
crucifixion he was there it was he was
48:24
there so that's in my head and then this
48:27
question comes from wendy
48:30
which is interesting about time she says
48:32
does the anointing work backwards in
48:34
time for instance if i release the
48:36
anointing
48:37
into a doorknob and i pray that
48:39
that it touches everybody who has
48:41
touched the knob
48:43
in the past and future
48:45
would that work that's an interesting
48:46
question so they're they're wanting to
48:48
pray backwards in time
48:51
well i'm not quite sure that would work
48:53
yeah that's an interesting one
48:55
i know i have
48:56
many conversations
48:58
about going back and changing everything
49:00
in time i i have to say personally the
49:04
father has never told me that was
49:06
possible
49:07
the only thing i know about something
49:09
like that ever happening in in probably
49:12
rarely that somebody was sent back
49:15
that i don't do this i don't do that
49:17
don't ask me to do it because they
49:18
hadn't decided to go back and rescue
49:20
somebody really would have died so
49:22
they'll be here in this time i have
49:25
never ever and i don't see anywhere in
49:27
the bible that says you can go back and
49:29
change everything so uh somebody would
49:31
never live well i know people who want
49:33
they want to go back in time and wipe
49:35
out hitler uh so none of that stuff
49:37
would happen but i have to tell you
49:39
there are things on timelines that are
49:41
going to happen how we deal with them
49:44
and how we respond to them in that time
49:48
is really what matters i do not think
49:51
you can choose on your own i'm going to
49:52
go back in this time and wipe out
49:54
somebody so none of that would happen
49:56
sometimes there are certain people sent
49:59
that that are birthed through or because
50:02
of these people that then later become
50:04
great people and you would have wiped
50:06
out all of that you can't see it as i'm
50:08
going to fix this one thing you moving
50:11
somebody off the earth that never
50:12
existed and never wouldn't their
50:14
genealogy would be gone and yet great
50:17
people came out of some people who
50:18
weren't good
50:20
so you are not going to change this
50:22
whole world right now to be perfect this
50:24
is not heaven one day it will be perfect
50:27
and and there's some people who try
50:29
their whole life to do this um you can't
50:31
really pray over people who are in the
50:34
past right they're not there anymore
50:37
they're not here anymore and i think
50:39
people get really focused on that it
50:42
could even be a distraction i'm not
50:43
saying what you're wanting is not a good
50:45
thing i'm just saying it's not going to
50:48
happen yeah
50:49
he shows me things to have true
50:51
revelation on how those things happen or
50:54
what really took place like in the
50:56
spirit realm back in that time and
50:58
things like that but but i know people
51:00
personally who want to go back
51:03
in other words you can't say well i wish
51:05
i'd met this person years ago i'll go
51:08
back in time and make it happen then it
51:09
only met them and not the others
51:12
you you're not gonna do that okay you're
51:14
not god number one you aren't changing
51:17
god's timeline of what is going to
51:20
happen
51:21
and so i would encourage you pray for
51:23
what's going on right now you can pray
51:25
into the future though you can make a
51:27
stand for you and your family line up to
51:30
a thousand generations you can declare
51:32
over them and that will make a
51:34
difference of those coming in the future
51:38
your life should be focused on future
51:40
current and future that's good because
51:42
you are not going to change the path now
51:46
kat let me tell you a really short
51:47
version of something that talks right
51:49
into the future it was a bizarre
51:51
incident about god had
51:54
me encount
51:55
encountered like 15 years ago he took me
51:57
to a jewish cemetery in in queens new
52:00
york okay and what there's this bizarre
52:02
it's too hard to explain why i ended up
52:05
there i saw these two people that then
52:06
disappeared i'm convinced they were
52:08
angels they told me where the entrance
52:10
is the largest jewish cemetery in this
52:13
part of
52:14
new york i ended up in this jewish
52:16
cemetery and i was looking for a place
52:18
to hide and pray okay
52:20
i found only one spot in the entire
52:22
cemetery is like this horse shoot in i
52:24
thought why am i here lord i have no
52:26
idea i got on my knees nobody could see
52:28
me that's why i chose that spot god
52:31
didn't say go here i was just trying to
52:33
hide yeah and i and and so i thought i
52:35
got nothing to pray i started thinking
52:37
looking at the headstone thinking well
52:39
may you know that scripture about
52:41
ezekiel prays for the bones to come
52:43
alive and i was going through my head
52:45
and i said well i don't know about that
52:46
but i'm gonna pray and the name on the
52:49
headstone was finkelstein or finkelstein
52:51
however he said and so i said lord i
52:53
pray for every
52:55
living relative of finkelstein from
52:58
these finkelsteins to be blessed blah
53:00
blah i prayed something like that just
53:02
like that i wrote this up on the elijah
53:05
list and this guy wrote to me from
53:07
germany he said steve hold on to your
53:09
hat
53:10
while you were doing that we had a
53:12
special guest from israel whose last
53:14
name was finkelstein and she said i will
53:17
never go to germany not after they did
53:19
this to my people and during that time
53:22
you were praying
53:23
she was weeping because of all the
53:26
healing that was taking place now that's
53:28
praying it forward right yes it is yes
53:32
that amazing isn't that amazing yes and
53:34
i'm sure that um god did put that on
53:37
your heart to pray that specific prayer
53:39
at that very time yeah
53:41
even though you didn't hear him say to
53:43
go there i'm sure your angel was
53:44
impressing you even though you couldn't
53:46
see him that was something god needed
53:48
spoken he needed it released and spoken
53:51
in the earth and you did it when things
53:53
line up with god's timing it is the most
53:56
amazing significant thing
53:59
you will experience in your life when
54:00
that happens but just that one little
54:02
act of doing that
54:04
uh not even understanding it because
54:07
look at look at what that reached that
54:08
was powerful yeah it was powerful
54:10
awesome awesome okay
54:12
um
54:15
i want to make sure
54:16
cat have you seen jesus seated at the
54:19
right hand of the father
54:21
on his throne or does he share a throne
54:24
i've always wondered
54:25
that's a confusing scripture does he sit
54:27
on the same
54:28
sea or does he share a throne because
54:30
he's seated beside the father
54:32
then he seated with the father so what
54:34
is it
54:35
i think it's whatever they want at the
54:37
time i have seen both i've seen christ
54:39
on a throne by himself i have seen him
54:42
many times sitting in his father's
54:44
throne right next to him i have seen
54:46
that happen
54:48
i think also significantly to let people
54:51
know is there is one general
54:54
massive throne room i call it the
54:56
general throne room because there's more
54:57
than one throne room there's the
54:59
commissioning throne room there's the
55:01
throne room that's connected to the
55:03
courtroom
55:04
there's another a courtroom where people
55:07
are given in the spirit weapons to pray
55:09
with
55:10
there's more than one i think the
55:11
commissioning throne room is in our
55:13
calendar when we did the one
55:16
the most recent one we did for 2021 it
55:18
has a picture of the father on the
55:19
commissioning throne room and that's the
55:22
one that has the horns before the altar
55:24
and he actually puts mantles on people
55:27
and when he's going to give you a new
55:29
mantle your layer of you that looks just
55:32
like you you yourself are seated and
55:34
have any places in heaven if you people
55:36
caught up there you might see yourself
55:37
sitting on the throne that would be a
55:38
spiritual image of you is called into
55:41
the commissioning throne room he
55:42
literally puts a mantle on you when you
55:44
hold on the horns of the altar and he's
55:46
decreeing things over you
55:48
at that time in your life there could be
55:50
someone praying those very things over
55:52
you or you felt something come over you
55:54
something and then the holy spirit began
55:56
to speak to you but the general throne
55:58
room is the one mentioned in the book of
55:59
revelations
56:01
revelations 4 what sau where john is
56:04
caught up and sees the father
56:06
with the with the rainbow coming in and
56:08
out of him is very clear uh he doesn't
56:11
see jesus at that point but he sees the
56:13
father on his throne and and the
56:15
rainbow's moving in and out of him
56:17
and even when um they i think it was uh
56:20
was it ezekiel that saw the throne
56:22
moving being moved yeah the wheels and
56:25
the wheels the wheels within wheels yes
56:27
that's the spirit of the living creature
56:29
that comes out it looks like a gyroscope
56:32
it's more like this it's not like a
56:34
wheel within just a wheel it's not like
56:35
that it's like something that would move
56:37
i've seen that but so there's many
56:40
different
56:41
places in the bible it talks about the
56:42
throne but i totally have seen him
56:45
sitting right next to his father then
56:47
again i've seen times when i saw jesus
56:50
just on a throne and you know if you
56:52
don't know he also has his own mansion
56:55
in heaven jesus has a mansion the father
56:58
has a personal place that is his in
57:00
heaven also
57:01
it's not like the throne is vacated
57:03
usually one or the other are in there
57:06
especially if someone's coming home to
57:07
heaven they will both be in that throne
57:09
room but i've seen him sitting right
57:11
next to the father or something does
57:12
everyone come home to the throne room is
57:15
that what you're saying you have to
57:17
okay okay
57:18
because i'm always picturing showing up
57:20
at the gate somewhere you know always
57:22
the jokes about saint peter wait i don't
57:24
really mean saint peter but but
57:27
but
57:28
he meets you at the gate yeah some sort
57:30
of gate thing or something there is a
57:32
huge gate the one with the portals is a
57:34
massive gate but but there is a
57:37
disembarking place like we have airports
57:39
where you a certain place you don't land
57:41
in anybody's yard there's a place when
57:43
you arrive somewhere that you come to
57:45
whether it's a train depot or something
57:47
like that there's a there's a depot when
57:50
you're caught up whether you're in any
57:51
kind of a transport or really and a
57:54
chariot up to heaven the first place you
57:56
will always come to is this depot in
57:59
heaven which is gorgeous you see the
58:00
river of life you see the gates a little
58:02
way off and a lot of family members or
58:05
pets are waiting for you there
58:07
like i saw oral roberts when he came
58:08
home the masses were out there to
58:10
welcome him
58:12
and um so you're you're there and then
58:14
jesus many times will greet you finally
58:17
escort you into the throne room he's the
58:20
one who walks you back up the throne to
58:22
the father it says he is the door
58:25
it says jesus is the only way back to
58:27
the father so jesus himself eventually
58:30
no matter who comes up in heaven he will
58:31
come get them and walk them up the steps
58:33
to the throne and say look father here's
58:35
your son here's your daughter they've
58:37
come home wow individually everybody
58:40
gets that individually individually very
58:44
cool very cool i don't think i ever
58:46
understood that wow
58:47
i love this stuff all right um
58:51
the bible describes the four creatures
58:53
oh you just talked about that in ezekiel
58:56
and revelation as being covered in eyes
58:58
why eyes
59:00
and their question is what do eyes
59:01
represent i don't know if it represents
59:03
something it is something right it's a
59:05
it's useful eyes right they're doing
59:08
something right there
59:09
[Laughter]
59:12
yeah you know
59:14
they're not just there for good looks
59:16
right
59:17
no that they help
59:19
why do you have eyes to use something
59:20
yeah to see right because she says what
59:22
do they represent and i'm thinking
59:24
they're not representing right they're
59:26
actually doing
59:27
those wheels when the
59:29
the wheels with them within the wheels
59:32
it is the spirit of the living creatures
59:34
that talks about it on the throne
59:36
it that part of them comes out and it
59:38
navigates
59:40
they didn't lose their eyes in their
59:41
head they didn't lose their eyes all
59:43
over their body they have thousands of
59:45
eyes in their wings these are the living
59:47
creatures and it talks about this it
59:49
says it says in the bible that that that
59:51
wheel in the wheel of the spirit living
59:53
creature it's gonna move the throne it
59:55
comes out it's gonna navigate it's gonna
59:57
move it it has to see where it's taking
60:00
the throne so these eyes are living
60:03
they're not pictures of eyes they're not
60:04
just paintings of eyes these are living
60:07
eyes that are in these wheels within the
60:09
wheel and i may get something like that
60:11
to represent that and they literally
60:13
they catch them and they navigate the
60:15
throne wherever it goes in heaven or
60:17
wherever now the living creatures are
60:19
there but that wheel within the wheel
60:21
that's their spirit that's part the
60:22
navigation throne so it has to see
60:25
whatever has eyes in heaven is alive
60:28
yeah
60:29
it's just a being it's a spirit or it is
60:33
like one of the hosts or something like
60:34
that
60:36
okay wow
60:37
live okay now here's a question about
60:40
they want to know about does the spirit
60:42
does the holy spirit have a sense of
60:44
humor
60:45
does he say funny quips or she actually
60:48
said funny jokes but i'm i don't know
60:51
yeah so tell me
60:52
yes yeah between between father son and
60:55
holy spirit holy spirit is the drama
60:57
king
60:58
that is his nickname in heaven
61:01
he is a very funny he's very focused
61:04
very serious he loves to put on a show
61:08
and i don't know what else you would
61:09
call it back in the days when the holy
61:11
spirit was falling on people everywhere
61:14
speaking in tongues is quite a show if
61:16
you've never seen or heard it it's very
61:18
powerful it is the holy spirit speaking
61:20
through the mouth of these the of the
61:22
people that invite him to indwell them
61:24
he moves into so think you get jesus
61:28
right you get holy spirit you already
61:29
got a show going on the inside of you
61:31
holy spirit loves drama he loves um he
61:34
loves movies he loves he loves
61:37
theatrical stuff
61:38
good
61:40
decent exciting powerful stuff because
61:43
some people have this picture of how it
61:45
is on earth it's not always good to talk
61:46
about those things no holy spirit does
61:49
have the greatest sense of humor of all
61:51
three of them oh wow and he is the one
61:54
who gives me the one liners to say to
61:56
people when they don't want to hear them
61:58
or when they love it and they hear it
62:00
it's always him that gives it to me and
62:02
if i'm talking about something he will
62:04
say to me talk about this
62:06
like right now just stop and talk about
62:08
this that's him
62:10
uh so he totally will get involved in
62:12
your life he does give you direction it
62:14
says so uh sometimes it's direction
62:16
because you need to know sometimes it's
62:18
because he wants you to
62:21
so he's just he's the pageantry guy he's
62:23
the funny man he's the he loves
62:27
pageantry he's the life of the party guy
62:29
huh
62:30

62:35
celebrations uh and he loves sweets he
62:39
just does and he loves flowers and
62:42
he loves to dance and he dances with
62:44
everybody in the throne sometimes these
62:46
mass big dances they have and that may
62:48
not be in your mind your mind is what in
62:50
the world are we going to do besides
62:52
bowing before the throne of god
62:54
i'm telling you they would be bored
62:56

62:58

63:05
victory come they love victory in your
63:08
life
63:09
and they celebrate and rejoice it says
63:11
they celebrate over one person just one
63:13
person coming home to heaven there you
63:15
go out the one person
63:16
uh they they love
63:19
life
63:20
and they actually live life in heaven
63:23
there's no oppression there's no doom
63:24
and gloom there's no threats there's no
63:27
fear there's no rejection there's none
63:29
of that there there's life and living
63:32
life at its fullest and that's why he
63:34
gives us what he gives us grace
63:37
for abundant life
63:40
that's an abundance you have to have joy
63:42
you have to have celebration um
63:44
everybody wants to you know make sure
63:46
things are taken care of and we should
63:48
we should make sure you know that we're
63:50
being uh having integrity with with
63:52
money and if you think i'm misspending
63:54
money i will just give you this
63:56
if he sends it
63:58
he spends it oh that's a good one any
64:01
money it's where god wants it spent and
64:03
how he wants it spent maybe you should
64:06
start saying that god i would love to
64:08
have this much money if you send it i'll
64:10
let you spend it and then he will
64:11
influence you to make sure it's okay for
64:14
you to have money it's okay
64:17
to have good things uh god wants us to
64:19
be blessed but remember other people who
64:21
don't remember if you say if you get a
64:23
bunch of money say god is there
64:24
somewhere you want me to spend some of
64:25
this money
64:26
i promise you he's going to tell you but
64:28
that is my motto no matter what i end up
64:31
by having if he sends that money and he
64:34
does through many sources he is going to
64:37
have the right to spend that money
64:38
that's good you know i love that line
64:40
too
64:41
i had not heard you talk about bars in
64:43
heaven but this relinda says can you
64:46
talk about the bars you saw in heaven i
64:48
guess they mean is there some sort of a
64:52
starbucks place or what what what have
64:54
you told people i don't remember that
64:56
one well i think they may be talking
64:57
about the kind of cell alcohol
65:00
i don't know and they can't be talking
65:01
about alcohol unless it's spiritual
65:04
alcohol
65:05
yes i will tell you the only a neighbor
65:08
i can't even say this yeah that's an
65:09
inebriated inebriated in heaven is from
65:12
the holy spirit yeah his presence just
65:15
causes that to happen you laugh out loud
65:18
i mean you fall on the road the streets
65:20
of gold sometimes laughing out loud
65:22
because of the prince of the holy spirit
65:24
the only wine they have in heaven it
65:27
does not have alcohol
65:29
alcohol
65:30
this may be a crusher just loose it from
65:32
your soul no beer no hard liquor no
65:35
there's not in heaven nothing cages
65:38
nothing ferments it's not going to
65:39
happen but you will have holy spirit
65:42
wine to drink and let me tell you you'll
65:44
never have a hangover from i've never
65:47
drank i've never experienced that and
65:48
don't want to have no desire for it i'm
65:51
actually very much against alcohol don't
65:53
offer me a drink you will get a message
65:56
okay i'm just going to save it for free
65:57
yeah people excuse me of drinking
65:59
they're lying out right because i
66:01
despise that my dad used to rescue
66:04
surviving alcoholics and i saw what it
66:06
did so let's go back to heaven
66:08
there are places you can go into
66:11
that people are playing music and the
66:13
joy of the lord and uh people who do
66:16
guitar and stuff like that um not elvis
66:18
doesn't do that but elvis does play in
66:20
his own room many times himself wow yes
66:23
there's they're more it's more like i
66:25
guess what what are they called pubs i
66:27
guess it's more like a pub place you
66:29
could eat food delicious food you can
66:31
have wine from heaven if you want to and
66:34
then you come out and you fall off your
66:36
stool and they drag you out and laugh in
66:37
the streets
66:39
that kind of thing happens but it isn't
66:41
tied to darkness or evil you're not
66:43
going to be drunk god talks against
66:46
drunkards and you know he says strong
66:50
drink is a mocker is going to mock you
66:53
with your life so you shouldn't go there
66:56
right you should go there
66:58
and the the the wine that they talk
67:00
about in the bible biblical wine was i
67:02
think three percent alcohol people uh i
67:05
would very not even very good to pour it
67:07
on a wound but when you hear about
67:09
celebrations
67:11
most jews drank um
67:14
that's the wine they drink is three
67:16
percent alcohol it's not 25 or 100 proof
67:18
you know 100
67:20
100 proof of holy spirit maybe yeah but
67:22
but in one way she is kind of right
67:25
there are places to go you meet with
67:27
your friends you laugh and talk and
67:29
celebrate together
67:31
but only the holy spirit's presence they
67:33
have vineyards in heaven everybody can
67:35
jump in the baths and mash the grapes
67:37
they put them in these huge vests i've
67:39
been there and then holy spirit
67:41
literally will invade every single vat
67:44
nice nice in these vineyards so when you
67:47
drink it you're getting filled with him
67:49
not
67:50
with jesus
67:52
there are things like now i'm not a
67:53
coffee drinker but most of the earth
67:56
loves
67:57
all the different varieties of coffee
67:59
and frappuccinos
68:00
that's about the coffee steve yeah so
68:02
are there these places with all kinds of
68:04
coffees
68:05
yes
68:06
there are and there are people who grow
68:09

talking for hours it seems like right
71:07
and so if they're talking for hours
71:09
is the entire conversation about the
71:12
lord or are they talking about this
71:14
family member and that activity what
71:16
what what would you have you heard
71:18
conversations it's like most of my
71:21
conversations
71:23
i had two in the department store
71:25
yesterday i just started because of my
71:27
hair of course i got to share heaven
71:29
what's going on i mean they get the
71:30
whole thing and oh i love your pink hair
71:32
what's that or they'll say where are you
71:34
from and i'll go heaven
71:36
i have a heaven conversation in the
71:38
department store uh i do talk about
71:40
other things sometimes like i love
71:42
horses you know i did so people in
71:44
heaven depending on what encounters
71:46
they're having you can have encounters
71:48
in heaven with jesus really okay person
71:50
to person you can have one with the
71:51
father they talk a lot about that but
71:53
they do talk about family they do talk
71:55
about friends people go on tours all
71:58
over heaven maybe they just got to go to
72:01
the valley of the falls you know see
72:02
these 200 foot waterfalls or dive down
72:04
in them maybe they got to go to the
72:06
mountain of spices and see fall leaves
72:08
this big that never dropped their colors
72:10
wow
72:11
and they're all in these places
72:14
talking about their experiences they
72:16
just had and how amazing and then they
72:18
go oh what have you been here have you
72:20
seen this isn't god good to us don't you
72:23
love having us beyond anything yes they
72:25
have conversations like that that's good
72:28
now do they do do they have
72:29
conversations
72:31
you know i've asked you this in
72:32
different ways over the years
72:35
about reminiscing do they reminisce
72:37
about how our children came to the lord
72:40
or is that so old news that it's all
72:43
current my family over here is doing
72:45
this and my daughter over there has a
72:47
coffee shop and my son over there has a
72:50
uh old car
72:52
model t shop what what what did they
72:55
talk about family yeah
72:57
i think they do both okay i think they
73:01
they don't have their memory their whole
73:03
memory is not taken away i think your
73:05
memories of really tragic traumas you
73:08
don't talk about them in heaven at all
73:10
but certainly fun times you have with
73:11
your family when
73:13
they and their child could be sitting
73:15
next to them now you're still going home
73:17
as your father son and daughter but you
73:20
still remember your family members you
73:21
live near them you go on trips together
73:23
so yeah you can talk about fun things
73:25
that you did on the earth sometimes
73:27
uh real important ones was how they got
73:29
born
73:30
again okay yeah and the other thing you
73:33
talk about is you're taken to a theater
73:35
when you go to heaven that shows your
73:37
whole life relived with all of the sins
73:40
and the and the evil and harsh things
73:43
that happen removed and you will see
73:45
every time your angel intervened saved
73:48
your life how holy spirit influenced you
73:51
what was going on in heaven when you did
73:54
certain things on the years and the
73:55
prayers how they changed your life you
73:58
see all that the first thing you want to
73:59
do
74:00
is go to the coffee shop next to this
74:02
place and talk to all your friends about
74:04
that
74:06
how your angel intervened and because
74:08
your friends go sometimes to watch your
74:10
life we live you know i my my you know
74:13
i've told many many times on this
74:14
program i have a very very abusive
74:16
father he's with the lord now he's been
74:18
with me he loves you oh awesome and i
74:20
love him and he's been there about 30
74:22
years but but the life of my life
74:25
especially as a child let's say my up to
74:27
my teenage years or yeah or young adults
74:29
was was the word the abuse so how does
74:32
he so does he replay my childhood
74:35
showing me
74:36
this momentary good thing with my father
74:38
this momentary good thing
74:40
so i would end up with memories only of
74:43
the good things he ever did
74:44
yes
74:46
yeah
74:46
because in you um in anyone in heaven
74:50
there's no sorrow
74:52
there's no fears
74:54
there's no regrets even you don't even
74:56
have regrets it's gone it's not part of
74:59
your and you have to remember you're in
75:01
your spiritual body right your soul is
75:04
with you your soul does not sleep your
75:05
body sleeps in the earth your body
75:08
sleeps but your soul with all the memory
75:10
banks that has in it even if you
75:12
approach to something there would be no
75:15
wounding you can't be re-wounded in
75:17
heaven it's not going to be trauma again
75:20
but but most people don't even think
75:22
about that they're so thrilled and
75:23
amazed that they're there they think
75:24
about the goodness of god they will
75:26
usually talk about the good memories and
75:28
the good things that happen even the
75:30
movie is not like a solid movie it
75:32
sometimes leaves out years of your life
75:34
on purpose you're not going to expose
75:37
these theaters are not to expose every
75:38
wicked evil thing that you did is it's
75:40
about the grace and the goodness of god
75:43
and how he influenced you your angels
75:45
influenced you how they saved your life
75:47
how they brought you up spiritually
75:50
together with other people that you were
75:52
involved in ministry or stuff the good
75:54
stuff it's the good stuff that you get
75:55
to see so that you come out so filled
75:58
with life and gratitude for god now
76:00
people give testimonies in heaven uh
76:02
someone new comes home everybody wants
76:04
to go hear them um
76:06
talk about their life on the earth
76:08
they're always always going to talk
76:10
about the power of god the goodness of
76:12
god his mercies to them and so people
76:15
when somebody comes home i they're all
76:16
probably still trying to hear uh
76:18
halftime is here or robert speak or
76:20
billy joe daughtry or
76:22
smith wigglesworth the people want to
76:24
get to know
76:26
but mainly if somebody new comes they
76:28
all have certain events where they can
76:30
go and speak in people or you can invite
76:32
them to speak to your own friends and
76:33
stuff in heaven so everybody wants to
76:35
know what did you think
76:37
when you first stepped out of your body
76:40
well they do they do talk about that
76:42
okay they do how did you feel when you
76:45
knew you were gone right your body was
76:47
lifeless you turned around you don't
76:48
know you're dead sometimes steve because
76:50
you feel you're as a spiritual being you
76:53
will be able to feel your body you can
76:55
pass through this these natural walls
76:57
but but there's a spirit realm
76:58
everywhere where your spiritual body
77:00
when it steps out it's alive filled with
77:02
the life of god the joy here you for the
77:05
first time seeing your guardian angels
77:07
or jesus has come in his own chariot to
77:09
pick you up but you're like
77:10
oh you are so undone and excited and
77:14
waves of joy begin to feel you fled over
77:17
you so everybody wants to hear
77:19
how did you feel when that happened oh
77:22
wow i didn't know that happened that was
77:24
really good good to hear wow thinking of
77:27
my mom who's very close
77:29
and uh
77:30
to see that happen to her
77:33
to know that it's not to see it because
77:35
i'm not a seer but and you do see you've
77:37
been uh at the bedside of more than one
77:40
person who passed
77:41
you watch them step out don't you i did
77:44
i did uh my husband's best friend
77:47
who was a native american indian we
77:50
called him chief that was his nickname
77:52
uh he decided to stay in florida instead
77:54
of go back to the reservation when he
77:56
got out of the marines they were in the
77:57
marines together he was somebody who
77:59
laughed he was such a great person he
78:01
laughed everything he never wanted to
78:03
take him to a funeral he would laugh
78:04
because he had that joy in him
78:07
and uh so we really loved him a lot he
78:09
got married his wife eventually passed
78:11
away
78:12
and he he really missed her after after
78:14
she passed away and so then he wasn't
78:17
feeling well i think he just wanted to
78:19
go to heaven anyway we were with him a
78:21
lot in the last few weeks especially my
78:23
husband actually went and cared for him
78:25
and i was out speaking and my husband
78:28
called and they said the the hospital is
78:30
telling me they don't think he'll make
78:31
it through the night so we came directly
78:33
from the airport to his hospital room
78:36
and he was like in icu
78:38
and this precious person who wasn't um
78:41
used to be a hospice nurse
78:43
was had gotten um i guess he got trained
78:46
to be an intern or something he was
78:48
there present with him he was so undone
78:51
that we were we came to be with him even
78:52
though we weren't family family i said
78:55
oh he is like family and i knew
78:57
everything that was going on i saw
78:59
angels waiting
79:00
somewhere in the room some were just his
79:02
own angels were around his bed all the
79:04
time they were touching him they were
79:06
saying things in his ear
79:08
i had time to call each of our daughters
79:10
and let them say goodbye to him because
79:12
he was that precious to them
79:14
and then and the guy said well he's
79:16
going to be another eight hours and i'm
79:18
like no he's not
79:19
i was telling
79:21
he said how do you know that i see the
79:22
angels who are about to come in i said
79:24
they're waiting they're waiting for us
79:26
to make sure we get our daughters to say
79:27
goodbye and he's going to go he's
79:29
probably maybe in the next hour he'll be
79:30
gone he said oh i don't think so well
79:33
it's okay it's all right don't worry
79:34
about it and so this is our last
79:36
daughter
79:38
said to him in his ears no he wasn't
79:40
responding i mean he his heartbeat was
79:42
still going but his angels were watching
79:45
everything we did they would smile every
79:47
time wow her daughters got to say it
79:49
went in his spirit it went into spirit
79:52
and i saw the words going in his spirit
79:54
it was very powerful and then more and
79:56
more angels began to come in behind the
79:58
others and i went it's not going to be
79:59
very long and so my husband said goodbye
80:01
to him i said goodbye to him and there
80:03
was a rush
80:05
there was a rush you could i could hear
80:07
and feel the rush the rush of angels
80:09
filling the room and then he goes
80:12
his spiritual body went out and went
80:13
well he's gone and he goes no he's not
80:16
and then there goes zayn
80:18
[Laughter]
80:20
then he starts to cry he goes you really
80:22
saw that happen
80:24
i'm like yes this is what happened he
80:26
said i always thought
80:28
that they were alone everybody was alone
80:30
they died and went no no their angels do
80:32
not leave them if they're going to
80:34
heaven they can't leave them they'll
80:36
always be with them and when they step
80:38
out of their body the first thing
80:39
they'll see is they're greening their
80:41
guardian angels so they're getting to
80:44
finally see the one who's been with them
80:46
since they were since before they were
80:47
born actually so i saw them all
80:49
according to the room filled with light
80:52
shh
80:52
and they rushed in and took him and went
80:54
up wow well he's gone
80:57
wow wow okay and it's amazing to me that
81:00
you know
81:01
god could have done it with just one
81:03
angel he didn't need a room full of it
81:05
what's what's the deal with that why
81:08
why
81:09
we're our benefit to know
81:11
uh chief loved people
81:14
he would give you the shirt off his back
81:16
he was so kind and he loved people i
81:19
think it was out of honor of how he
81:21
lived his life i think it was about the
81:23
honor he had
81:24
uh not even so much as us but i got to
81:26
witness it and the more you honor god
81:29
with your life um the more are going to
81:32
be present to escort you home to heaven
81:35
and like i saw i mean i saw many known
81:38
people uh being taken up to heaven and
81:40
jesus came and got them himself and in
81:43
his fiery chariot and he just held out
81:45
his hand he said come on it's time to go
81:47
home
81:48
and they would not even hesitate to get
81:50
there the guardian angels were right
81:51
there so it is a powerful you're seeing
81:54
a hospital room with you know the bags
81:57
hooked to them you see this
81:59
but in the spirit
82:01
if you're love and belong to jesus
82:02
christ there is a celebration going on
82:05
around you in that room
82:07
you don't wait to get to heaven to have
82:09
the peace and joy of god it floods the
82:11
room that's what part of the light was
82:13
that light came and filled his physical
82:16
body with that light and then it took
82:18
his spirit man just came out
82:21
wow
82:22
filled with joy and celebration they
82:24
were celebrating that he was going home
82:27
to heaven so even though you thought
82:29
they were alone they died
82:31
not alone if they belong to jesus christ
82:34
so so so many people are hearing this
82:36
and their fear of death is leaving them
82:38
i mean i can feel it happen that is very
82:40
very cool so many hundreds hundreds of
82:42
thousands
82:43
you have more light
82:45
spiritual bodies
82:46
the room is filled with the light of god
82:49
the glory coming off of your angels the
82:51
grins on their faces
82:53
and uh if it's your guardian angel and
82:55
you liked something like i still
82:57
remember the young man who passed who
82:58
was like a comedian
83:00
he passed young and he used to wear this
83:03
clown nose all the time in church just
83:05
to make jokes to people and everything
83:07
when he passed i saw it when he he the
83:10
angel tried to get him to come and get
83:12
him to come and and he didn't look up
83:14
and finally goes it's time to go when he
83:16
looks up his own angel is wearing a red
83:19
clown nose
83:22
are you serious are you serious
83:24
and then the young man did not hesitate
83:27
he just went forward like this he
83:29
stepped out his physical body fell back
83:31
and he said here's one for you and gave
83:33
him a clown nose to wear on his trip
83:36
home to heaven
83:38
that's hilarious that is hilarious well

01:34
well greetings and happy wednesday
01:37
february 16 22. welcome to the broadcast
01:40
we're very
01:42
i'm very very excited about this
01:44
broadcast because i katz agreed to
01:46
answer um a really important question
01:48
here in just a few minutes we'll talk
01:50
about other things that are mined and my
01:52
first question is going to be
01:54
and she's ready for it what do you do
01:56
when a family member goes rogue and i'm
01:58
going to give her a couple of real life
02:00
things that we know about that we've
02:01
heard
02:02
where suddenly a family member just
02:04
completely goes off and they've got some
02:07
real keys even almost like secret tips
02:09
that they don't even know what you're
02:10
doing but how you can
02:14
uh i answer or even really honestly part
02:17
of it so i'm really really excited about
02:19
it so if you have a friend that this
02:20
would apply to i'll be sure and have a
02:23
quick text and have them listen to the
02:24
broadcast but sure and subscribe to
02:27
elijahlist.com because after every
02:30
broadcast we will email to your inbox
02:33
the the program the link to it an intro
02:36
the photo so you can see it see it and
02:38
send it and get it all over the place um
02:41
it's just one more way of course you can
02:42
share from youtube you can share it from
02:44
facebook as well
02:46
but that's one easy way if you're like
02:47
if you're kind of an email person like
02:49
me so
02:50
all right and by the way a quick
02:52
reminder that tim sheets will be on
02:54
tomorrow he's got some revelation about
02:56
i don't i can't remember exactly which
02:58
day it started last week
03:00
or the week before but a 54-day prophecy
03:03
about something that's going to happen
03:06
and
03:06
54 days of change julie just typed in
03:09
there so
03:10
i guess it's more about the changes that
03:13
will happen there so i'm looking forward
03:15
to hearing it
03:16
actually hearing tim's sheets do it so
03:19
uh to teach on that or revelato and that
03:22
might be a better way to say it all
03:24
right
03:25
well i think that's it
03:27
let's bring in cat curry i'm real
03:29
excited about this one
03:32
hello cat
03:33
hi
03:35
that's so good to see you
03:39
i'll tell you i'm so excited about today
03:40
we're gonna bushwhack the enemy people
03:43
is payback time okay that's what it is
03:46
and uh now you can you know when the
03:49
enemy tries to attack you you should
03:50
definitely begin to attack the things
03:52
that are important to him
03:54
uh and he realizes he's not gonna get
03:56
away with attacking us anymore it's not
03:59
it's just not going to work okay when
04:01
you've got revelations so this is
04:02
exciting day awesome i'm so excited i
04:05
really really am um so i'll share those
04:08
two examples in a minute anything else
04:09
you want to share
04:11
uh about anything current events or
04:12
whatever before we get into those
04:14
questions
04:15
i just know there's an amazing a social
04:19
media
04:21
launch happening i think it may be even
04:24
already starting or about to start right
04:25
now from number 45
04:28
uh if you haven't checked out you should
04:31
probably go to his website and find out
04:32
about it but we are going to have so
04:35
much freedom right now coming with all
04:37
of us to be in contact with number 45
04:41
awesome i think that's probably the most
04:43
exciting thing i could say is happening
04:45
right now
04:46
um it's going to be like almost not the
04:48
devil's worst nightmare but pretty close
04:50
to it it's about to happen
04:53
it's called his his social media is
04:55
called truth social and they originally
04:58
said it was going to come on towards the
04:59
end of february and now they're saying
05:02
some beta versions which means some
05:04
people will be testing it that's the
05:05
beta yeah
05:07
now they're saying that it will actually
05:08
come on the end of march which is
05:09
disappointing because i wanted it now
05:11
you know but
05:12
i think it decides how the test goes
05:14
steve i think if the tests go great i
05:17
think it will be launched much quicker
05:19
than that oh good that would be awesome
05:21
awesome and they're saying you know
05:23
they're not going to shadow band shadow
05:25
banning is when you write something and
05:28
you know and it starts to get
05:30
a lot of play and your friends are
05:32
liking it and all of a sudden
05:34
no one likes it anymore it's just stops
05:36
not a new livestream that's called
05:38
shadow banning that's what facebook does
05:40
uh and when they don't like what you're
05:42
doing they shadow about it they make it
05:44
go away so that they're not sharing it
05:46
with all your friends like they're
05:48
supposed to that's right and you don't
05:49
know the difference because there's
05:50
nothing you can see that says you've
05:52
been shadow banned it just stops you
05:55
know and so truth social is not going to
05:57
do that they're not even going to do
05:58
that on the left they're going to let
05:59
people say even on truth social what
06:02
they want to say so it's going to become
06:04
very popular very fast yes
06:07
so well okay anything else before we get
06:10
in these questions i just want to make
06:11
sure i give you i just want to say
06:14

this is a great time when you've been
07:47
living in revelation
07:49
especially as long as i have you learn
07:52
things that really do work against the
07:54
enemy so um we can go ahead and get
07:56
started let's let's jump into that
07:59
question because i don't know take as
08:01
long as you want in this that you don't
08:02
have to rush through because we have
08:03
other questions just take whatever time
08:05
you need to do this but there's here's
08:07
two actual um situations we're obviously
08:09
not saying names but there's a father
08:11
who was a good father he raised his
08:13
family uh he and his wife i think uh i'm
08:17
just i'm going to avoid saying things in
08:19
case someone's listening and it might be
08:21
uh yeah identify so he has he and his
08:24
wife have married 25 years all was well
08:27
and then
08:28
he discovered marijuana and then not
08:30
only did he discover marijuana but he
08:33
discovered and he went out and found the
08:35
highest
08:37
potency marijuana with the highest level
08:39
of thc
08:40
uh and kat his brain is just almost
08:44
fried he doesn't know
08:46
he's suddenly an enemy to his wife he
08:48
said he said you've always been this
08:50
evil bad person uh he was in the car i'm
08:53
told he was in the car like last week or
08:55
recently and threatened his wife if you
08:57
don't stop confronting me on this
08:59
marijuana i'm gonna drive this car off
09:01
the road and kill us both and this is a
09:03
man who was a christian
09:05
and all of that happened now so now cat
09:08
so and i'll tell you the other one in a
09:10
second but he is not in his right mind
09:13
to even
09:14
confront okay so that's that one
09:17
um now the other one and i'm sure there
09:19
were other details but we won't give too
09:20
many because i don't want to identify
09:21
yeah you don't need a whole lot just let
09:23
people know
09:24
um these things will affect your mind
09:27
and they'll tell you they never will
09:29
but uh i lived through a time i lived
09:31
through the 60s when a lot of drugs
09:34
were introduced and i'll go into that in
09:36
a minute so go ahead and share the other
09:37
scenarios so here's the other one
09:39
there's a family raised several children
09:41
uh all to all were baptized all were
09:44
raised to love the lord all got married
09:45
loving the lord and one of them the
09:48
couple the son and daughter-in-law
09:51
out of nowhere
09:53
just started becoming buddhists they
09:55
started putting up buddhist
09:56
paraphernalia they started then they
09:58
added crystals to it and they just
10:01
became buddhist out of nowhere and and
10:03
so how is it chris so that then we you
10:06
know hitch would hit whichever one of
10:08
these you want to first but of course
10:09
the generic question is what's a parent
10:11
supposed to do they're going didn't we
10:13
did we do something wrong did we
10:16
you know that kind of thing so i'm going
10:17
to throw that to you and see what you
10:19
have to to say about that well first of
10:21
all i want to say this um
10:24
especially
10:25
if these family members of yours uh
10:29
ever gave themselves to jesus now i'm
10:31
not saying the others don't have a
10:33
chance to come back but if they ever
10:35
gave themselves to jesus christ even as
10:37
a child you know what that does he puts
10:40
his mark on them
10:41
and he
10:42
he won't lose them he won't let them get
10:44
lost and i know for years we had a
10:47
family member who was kind of doing that
10:49
not like a sibling or something that
10:50
were they were doing some of the same
10:52
stuff we just talked about
10:54
and god said
10:55
you can't stop what you're doing to go
10:57
after them you will be the last person
10:59
to convince these people there's
11:00
something wrong with them uh you'll be
11:03
the last one that they'll even listen to
11:04
probably not want to listen to is as he
11:07
said in the first scenario uh they don't
11:10
want to hear from you
11:11
number one your family member and god
11:13
can send other people but the point is
11:15
this
11:16
if they gave themselves to jesus christ
11:18
he doesn't abandon them just because
11:20
they abandoned the walk with him or even
11:23
who he is and decide to go in a
11:25
different direction he's not going to
11:26
let them be lost okay he is going to go
11:29
after them it says in the bible that he
11:32
is actually married to the backslider
11:34
okay that's another word
11:36
that's who we would call these people uh
11:38
if they lived righteously they gave
11:41
himself to jesus christ you know had a
11:43
real commitment and children let me tell
11:44
you can't tell me they don't i got born
11:46
again at four it was such a dramatic a
11:49
traumatic not dramatic dramatic
11:51
experience for me being a seer that when
11:53
i invited him i actually saw jesus step
11:55
inside of me
11:57
even children at a very young age it is
12:00
important to introduce jesus christ to
12:01
them and even pray with them to know him
12:04
because let me tell you it puts
12:06
something in your spirit that even they
12:08
can't make leave and the why the reason
12:11
why this is important is the whole time
12:13
your family members are out there we
12:15
just call it going rogue because that
12:17
means they've gone off the track they've
12:19
left where they were
12:21
i'm talking about spiritually
12:22
emotionally physically and even mentally
12:26
drugs
12:27
alcohol
12:29
being involved in spiritual darkness
12:31
will all begin to alter
12:33
who you are and how you think because
12:35
your soul is impacted it really is all
12:38
about your soul but if you ever gave
12:40
yourself to jesus and if you're
12:42
listening right now and you you're going
12:44
through this yourself you're one of the
12:46
robes i can say lay down roll over and
12:49
give up because jesus christ is going to
12:51
get you
12:52
okay your family's not going to give up
12:54
on you those in heaven who know you
12:55
aren't giving up on you you may as well
12:57
just give up and get rid of the darkness
13:00
and get rid of of the evil that's
13:02
impacted your life because you you
13:04
belong to jesus christ still
13:06
okay so that's the number one thing you
13:08
need to know because that helps to bring
13:09
peace to people
13:11
you know you can't necessarily stop
13:13
what's happening with them of course you
13:15
pray and ask jesus to rescue them and
13:17
that's wonderful but when you yourself
13:20
are given weapons in the word and by
13:22
jesus christ
13:23
to come after and crush the darkness
13:26
that is surrounding them and number one
13:28
of course will be the host of heaven to
13:30
send them to put on strongholds when the
13:32
enemy can't get you and this is the
13:34
absolute truth when the enemy that would
13:37
be satan okay we're not talking about a
13:39
person we're talking about an empty
13:41
spiritual entity uh satan
13:44
who iniquity was found and born in him
13:47
by the way just so you know god didn't
13:49
make satan he made lucifer who was a
13:52
powerfully anointed beautiful being who
13:54
was anointed lead worship in heaven he
13:57
himself
13:58
chose in his own soul to become evil and
14:02
that was born in him it's the only thing
14:03
satan actually invented was evil uh if
14:06
you want to know the truth and so god
14:09
didn't make him that way as god didn't
14:11
make anybody who's going rogue was going
14:13
off the tracks running after darkness um
14:16
pursuing things that are dangerous to
14:18
them
14:19
and then make them not even
14:21
even sensible in their own mind
14:23
that's what the enemy does if you're a
14:25
strong belief likely you have family
14:28
members or really close people you call
14:30
family that are involved in being a
14:32
rogue person out there
14:35
because if the enemy can't get you can't
14:37
get you to come to his side can't get
14:40
you to live in sin or defile your person
14:43
or corrupt your mind you know or make
14:46
yourself uh incomprehensible to even
14:48
make sense in things if he can't get you
14:51
to do that he'll go after those closest
14:52
to you it's just his mo it's the way he
14:55
operates
14:56
so if you're already prepared and ready
14:57
even if you don't have somebody going
14:59
that way you'll already know how to take
15:01
authority over that and what to say
15:03
about it so number one jesus has got
15:05
people and i remember when this one team
15:07
remember we have we were praying jesus
15:10
said i have him he is he he was a he he
15:13
is in my hand and he's running around
15:16
doing all the stuff he thinks he wants
15:18
to do because he's gonna be impacted by
15:20
satan he said all i'm gonna do is i'm
15:21
gonna go like this
15:22
and he said and i'll take them and i
15:24
will get them back into the kingdom
15:28
that was jesus himself saying that and
15:31
also i do remember when i was in heaven
15:33
one of the times i left there jesus said
15:35
let them know that you're staying for
15:38
your family member is the most powerful
15:40
thing you can make a stand that they
15:42
will know jesus christ they will not
15:44
miss their destiny that you will be in
15:46
eternity together and that person who
15:49
now is probably you know screaming
15:51
against god or you or family
15:54
can you imagine you saying that person
15:57
will become a witness and a testimony to
16:00
the saving power of jesus christ and
16:02
those are some of the most powerful
16:04
words that you can say for anybody you
16:06
know that has run off and got off the
16:08
path jumped off the train the train was
16:10
run over them and just dragging them
16:11
down the tracks they've gotten that bad
16:14
and i know that some people who never
16:16
even got involved in things
16:18
drugs are one of the worst things you
16:20
can do and i don't care they can lie and
16:22
fry all day long to say marijuana is not
16:25
dangerous it is dangerous it's one of
16:27
the most used drugs and what happens is
16:30
you get hooked on that and they won't
16:32
agree with me with this but but i'm
16:34
sorry i lived in the 60s as a teenager i
16:37
would go to school
16:40
and there'd be some other kid who died
16:41
from drug overdose because it was just
16:43
being introduced here in this country
16:45
and they would give it to you for free
16:47
they would take you off campus and give
16:49
it to you and get you hooked on it and
16:51
then they would have you sell it to the
16:52
other students that's also how the enemy
16:55
works
16:56
and so they would begin to change their
16:58
nature even if they were the star a
17:00
sports athlete in the school or the
17:02
smartest kid in school the first thing
17:04
you noticed was their attitude change
17:07
their lifestyle change how they treated
17:10
other people changed it was that quick
17:13
it was that quick
17:15
and so you notice things like that going
17:17
on you just begin to pray against the
17:19
darkness that that they would begin to
17:22
notice so god would wake them up even in
17:24
the beginning stages of being involved
17:26
with this stuff but i want to go to the
17:28
first scenario that steve spoke of like
17:32
i said marijuana is one of the one of
17:34
the worst things that anyone can take
17:37
and they can say all they want to that
17:38
is good for you it is evil i've known
17:41
that since i was 16 that it is evil and
17:44
all it does is harm to you and you will
17:47
get hooked and this whole lie about
17:49
we're going to make it medicinal so it
17:51
now can be licensed and now it's being
17:53
grown everywhere where before they would
17:55
arrest you if they found you growing
17:56
that stuff and now they have shops
17:58
everywhere and i can just tell you this
18:00
there are hidden rooms i'm just going to
18:02
tell there's hidden rooms in some of
18:04
these places where they let you come in
18:06
and have parties in these back rooms and
18:09
they'll give you stronger stuff than you
18:11
even wanted but you're already beginning
18:13
to step into the illegal they said they
18:15
put a boundary about it but i still
18:17
don't trust it i don't trust it and
18:19
don't believe in in any way
18:21
if you're considering and doing it don't
18:23
do it it's a trap of the enemy and it's
18:26
also a trap of man because they will
18:28
make a lot of money off of you desiring
18:31
to have this and then they will
18:33
introduce you to stronger ones
18:35
and i can tell you some of that can be
18:37
really some some people you know they
18:39
may not even live past that first time
18:41
then they would get you hooked on
18:42
stronger drugs because anything that can
18:46
alter your mind which is part of your
18:49
soul the way you think
18:51
and then it can even alter your will
18:54
first it affects your mind and then your
18:57
will and then your emotions because
18:59
that's what your soul is and and doing
19:01
drugs no matter what type they are that
19:04
is exactly how you will be affected
19:06
that's why you notice the change in the
19:07
person the way they're thinking what
19:09
they're talking about uh wanting to go
19:12
off and not show up in places you know
19:14
where they're supposed to be there are
19:15
little types of signs in that and it
19:17
could be something other than that but
19:19
many times it is that and so you want to
19:22
come against number one the effect
19:25
the effect of it whether it's drugs or
19:27
alcohol back in the day before the drugs
19:29
came the same thing was happening with
19:31
alcohol
19:32
and you do not want people to drive
19:34
under the influence is what they call it
19:37
that's gg alcohol where you certainly
19:39
don't want them driving under the
19:41
influence of drugs uh your mind really
19:44
gets altered and the devil the reason
19:47
why the devil likes that is he can start
19:49
putting thoughts
19:50
in their mind if they're inebriated from
19:53
alcohol or if they're consumed by the
19:56
drugs that they're they're taking that
19:57
are so affecting it's beginning to alter
19:59
the way they think they think that is
20:02
themself
20:03
choosing to think about these things but
20:05
when you when you open up your mind to
20:08
the enemy he will begin to bombard you
20:10
with all kinds of thoughts like you know
20:12
you hate people these people are against
20:15
you they don't have the right to judge
20:17
you you just should end your life i mean
20:19
even those thoughts can start real early
20:21
so just so you understand how that works
20:24
and why it's never ever a good thing to
20:27
be involved in drugs and not even
20:30
alcohol if i'm ever with you don't you
20:32
dare offer me a drink you will be in big
20:34
trouble
20:37
and kevin excuse me
20:38
i'm not i will not touch any kind of
20:41
alcohol
20:42
my dad used to rescue alcoholics and let
20:45
me tell you it ruined your life and it
20:48
can also this it can affect the unborn
20:50
even if you're taking them and you're
20:52
pregnant you don't want to do that to
20:54
your baby just so you understand how
20:56
deadly the enemy's weapons are always
20:59
going to be fear number one deception
21:02
number two and then any kind of a form
21:05
of anything he can get you to do
21:07
uh even like some kind of um
21:10
uh satanic groups you go into
21:13
where where you want to be a part of
21:14
something satanic or or satanic worship
21:17
or sacrifices
21:20
yeah
21:21
in your own mind as a believer i know
21:24
you think good and you want good and i i
21:26
live that way i want good for everybody
21:29
i want people to be made whole i want
21:31
them to be rescued
21:32
god sent everyone here for a purpose and
21:34
he loves everybody but some people he
21:37
can't use because they themselves are
21:39
choosing
21:41
uh to be a part of darkness and the
21:44
enemy in this time
21:46
i know there's darkness on the ears by
21:48
the way it's not the great darkness
21:49
because i've been taken forward in the
21:51
times i won't even discuss them into the
21:53
perilous times which are long long
21:57
long away from here no matter anybody
21:59
thinks god's beginning something new for
22:01
greatness but in this time he is
22:03
exposing darkness and the enemy right
22:05
now is trying to take as many people as
22:07
he can destroy as many justices that he
22:10
can because in these days of greatness
22:12
and glory these very people would be
22:14
very dangerous against him
22:16
so you have to kind of understand how
22:18
the enemy thinks and if you're not that
22:20
kind of a person you probably aren't if
22:22
you're not into crime you don't have a
22:24
criminal mind if you're not into
22:25
darkness or evil you're not going to
22:27
even think you know or understand how
22:29
they think so the most important thing
22:32
when people get are caught off into
22:34
these things is to begin to pray over
22:37
their soul and the way they think but
22:40
the number one thing you need to do is
22:42
just declaring the blood of jesus over
22:44
them you do not have to do it in front
22:46
of them this is the best part of all of
22:49
this it's like your covert operations
22:51
with heaven and and let me tell you the
22:53
army of heaven is waiting holy spirit is
22:56
waiting uh when you begin to send them
22:59
against the strongholds pulling on your
23:02
family member is one of the greatest
23:04
things that you can do like i was
23:06
praying for one of those people uh last
23:09
night and i just said father i take
23:11
power over all the power of the enemy
23:14
trying to take and uh uh destroy the
23:17
life of this person god i command the
23:19
army of having to go to begin to pull
23:21
down strongholds being built around this
23:23
person's mind to affect their soul and i
23:27
i command the host of heaven to shut the
23:29
mouths of the demons that they can't
23:31
speak to these people they cannot
23:33
influence these people i speak confusion
23:36
into the mind of the enemy this is the
23:38
spiritual darkness that they will not
23:40
even be able to communicate with each
23:42
other they can't make plans against this
23:44
person they would not be able to carry
23:46
out orders from hell against this person
23:48
so i speak confusion into the mind of
23:50
the enemy and then i speak the fear of
23:52
god to come upon the enemy who is
23:55
pursuing this person to drag them into
23:57
darkness that whatever they attempt to
23:59
do it will fail in jesus name these
24:02
people will not be able to get the drugs
24:04
that they're running after that they
24:05
will all of a sudden that that open door
24:07
will disappear it will be shut and
24:10
disappear in jesus name that that supply
24:12
they've been getting from will be gone
24:14
in jesus name they will have no way to
24:16
pursue it no way to get it in jesus name
24:19
and i thank you father right now that we
24:21
begin to speak in the spirit realm to
24:23
that person to that person father we we
24:26
send the life of god the love of god the
24:29
plans of god to invade wherever they're
24:32
at right this moment in jesus name and i
24:36
can tell you as i speak those words i
24:39
see the hosts leaving i see holy spirit
24:42
invading the very home of the people who
24:45
are involved in these things to begin to
24:47
tear down and pull down strongholds i
24:49
can see a stronghold will bring itself
24:51
totally around somebody and continually
24:54
bombard their mind with thoughts that
24:56
aren't from god are not from god and are
25:00
not good thoughts
25:01
and so i'm going to stop and take a
25:03
drink request what are you doing let me
25:05
ask you this one question cat so yours
25:07
if i'm hurt hearing what you're saying
25:09
and teaching
25:10
is that family members probably have a
25:13
harder time than non-family members
25:16
reaching someone in this condition and
25:18
yet the same family members have an
25:20
easier time sending the host and praying
25:23
because their family god you're
25:25
providing a special place right you're
25:27
right
25:28
you have more authority in the spirit
25:31
realm
25:32
as a family member than anyone else
25:35
outside your family circle so if you're
25:38
a believer
25:39
it's okay to call other people to pray
25:41
but you know what you are blood related
25:44
you're blood related related by adoption
25:47
when there is that time made
25:49
you and your words in the spirit realm
25:51
have a greater impact against the enemy
25:53
than anyone else out there
25:56
so yes you are the number one person or
25:59
people who should be coming together to
26:01
pray over that person to come back to
26:04
christ but also to pray against the
26:06
darkness you have the right to cancel
26:09
their plans i'm talking about the
26:10
darkness you have the right to say i
26:12
cancel that assignment against my family
26:14
member right now in jesus name and i
26:16
command the host to go and pull down the
26:18
stronghold shut them out of demons
26:20
hinder halt and delay and interfere with
26:22
them able to get these drugs or alcohol
26:25
or whatever it is your words are
26:26
powerful they're like spears that go out
26:28
in the in the into the darkness begin to
26:31
pierce the enemy who's who's trying to
26:33
do this many times
26:36
that first couple times you pray that
26:38
you'll begin to see a change in that
26:40
person
26:41
especially this is something that has
26:43
just started
26:44
because the the biggest demons who are
26:46
trying to do all this have now been
26:48
pulled down i mean literally the hosts
26:51
will go and pull them away from them
26:53
they will dispatch them from them uh and
26:55
dispel the effects you can even pray
26:58
this declare this that even when they're
27:00
taking those drugs it will have no
27:03
effect on your family member make sure
27:06
you say their name when you're saying
27:07
this that they will have no effect
27:09
whatsoever no matter what they try to do
27:12
you nullify it you nullify the effects
27:14
it's having on your family member so
27:16
here you are coming you're making a
27:18
stand for their salvation number one
27:21
always number two you're coming against
27:22
the very darkness that is trying to pull
27:25
them into the enemy's camp and number
27:28
three
27:30
you're speaking against the effect of
27:32
anything that they're taking or anything
27:34
they have taken so there's a three
27:36
things right there very important and it
27:39
doesn't matter whether it's i can just
27:41
say it doesn't matter if it's drugs
27:42
alcohol pornography whatever it is
27:45
whatever weapon the enemy is trying to
27:47
destroy
27:48
the destiny of your family members with
27:51
you
27:52
have power over all of that what the
27:55
enemy wants you to do though is to get
27:58
upset
27:59
get distraught then get in tears break
28:02
down because then he's controlling both
28:05
of you he's keeping you from being
28:07
dangerous against him he's keeping you
28:10
from standing for that person to come
28:12
back to christ and he wants to do that
28:15
trust me so he's got you over here he's
28:16
controlling you and holding you down and
28:18
he's still running rampant with your
28:20
family members so you have to make sure
28:23
that you lose all fear
28:25
all anger
28:27
all
28:28
all cares all concerns you have to loose
28:30
out of your own soul because then your
28:33
soul and your mind will think clearly
28:35
and you can connect with heaven and if
28:38
holy spirit is asking you to do anything
28:40
else
28:42
you know related to that you'll hear him
28:44
clearly so number one to even start this
28:47
whole operation i call it covert
28:49
operation people that's what it is it's
28:51
a it's cwc covert with christ that's
28:54
what it is and
28:55
you can do this you can do this if you
28:58
list all those cares concerns and fears
29:00
from your own soul that the enemy's
29:02
bombarding you with because that's not
29:04
you that's the enemy trying to get you
29:06
to think the way he wants you to and
29:08
you're thinking clearly and then you
29:10
begin to bind to your soul the love the
29:12
power and the blood of jesus christ
29:14
you're going to become very dangerous
29:16
against hell so here you are number one
29:19
speaking and sinning on behalf of the
29:21
salvation that jesus is not going to
29:23
give up on those those who were saved
29:25
and they they went astray you know
29:27
remember the whole thing where he went
29:28
after the one lamb that got away from
29:31
the whole the whole herd of sheep the
29:33
flock of sheep whatever they're called
29:35
he went after the one the others were
29:38
fine they were safe they were supposed
29:40
to be where they were but the one who
29:41
went off to the craziness in this whole
29:44
scenario in the bible that's the one
29:46
jesus pursued so let me just
29:48
be right there with you pursuing that
29:50
family member so here they are you're
29:53
allowing jesus to help you so when the
29:55
satan looks at you it's like this thing
29:58
is not going where i wanted it to go i'm
30:01
losing control i'm losing the thoughts
30:04
of that person i can no longer bombard
30:07
them because that's been shut off for me
30:09
and now here jesus christ is getting
30:11
involved he's pursuing him holy spirit's
30:13
pursuing him so his whole plan he can
30:16
see his plan sinking
30:19
by the day by the minute and let me tell
30:21
you i would say full force every day for
30:23
at least a week
30:25
do this not all day all night but do
30:27
this at least once a day and say all
30:29
right i'm going to stand in the gap
30:31
right now and declare and you understand
30:33
first of all you're standing for the
30:35
salvation you're coming against the the
30:37
drugs and the effect they
30:39
they have on them
30:42
and then speak destiny into this person
30:44
but there's one more thing you can do
30:46
that is really powerful
30:49
as you all know john
30:51
2 27 says that when you receive jesus
30:54
christ as your savior you get a deposit
30:57
of the anointing and that anointing
31:00
lives in you you're never going to stop
31:01
hearing me
31:02
i'm never going to stop talking about
31:03
the anointing the anointing breaks the
31:07
yoke
31:08
what yo the yoke of any kind of darkness
31:10
it breaks the yolk uh jesus released it
31:13
everywhere he went it was in the hem of
31:15
his garment when that lady touches
31:17
garment when you would go into places
31:20
demons would run up because the
31:21
anointing you carry but you get a
31:22
deposit of that when you get born again
31:25
it isn't just any anointing you need a
31:27
deposit of him he steps inside of you
31:30
but you also get to deposit that
31:31
anointing anything this person owns
31:34
or touches as a family member you have
31:37
every opportunity to lay your hand on
31:39
something they would wear i tell people
31:43
anything they wear any doorknob and you
31:46
don't have to do it in front of them
31:47
this is covert remember covert with
31:49
christ
31:50
on their bed
31:53
oh yes this works really well if you lay
31:55
on their bed first cleanse it for the
31:58
kingdom but if you lay on their bed and
32:00
you begin to declare dreams and visions
32:03
of their destiny with jesus guess what's
32:05
going to happen and they may not tell
32:06
you this they will begin in their sleep
32:09
to have dreams of their destiny with
32:11
jesus christ because the anointing is
32:14
being released into that bed take your
32:16
hand in their closet and just run across
32:18
their clothes and say i release the
32:20
anointing to break the yoke of darkness
32:22
over them every time they wear something
32:24
the anointing will be they'll be wearing
32:26
the anointing and what food they're
32:28
going to eat release it and i we've had
32:30
people do this for three years in a row
32:32
we've worked with people everywhere
32:34
about releasing the anointing
32:36
you create a cloud of the anointing it
32:39
begins to even stay outside there's so
32:41
much in you but this family member every
32:44
time if you get to hug them just release
32:46
the anointing just stay on your breath
32:48
they release the anointing
32:50
but when the anointing gets involved it
32:52
brings it into a whole other level
32:55
of battle i'm just telling you right now
32:58
the anointing breaks the yoke of
32:59
darkness and everywhere you release it
33:02
where they sit where they sleep uh the
33:04
refrigerator handle the door handles on
33:07
on your home if they're still living
33:09
there with you
33:11
i tell people if they don't send no card
33:13
saying i miss you release the anointing
33:15
in the card uh in a text you want to
33:17
send them
33:18
i'm telling you i don't have my phone
33:20
with me but it is so powerful it's like
33:23
one of your greatest secret weapons why
33:26
do you think he gave it to all of us
33:28
and i tell people all the time you've
33:29
been sitting on one of the greatest
33:31
weapons they gave you sit in church
33:32
every sunday and yet that deposit has
33:35
never grown it's still in there the more
33:38
you put out of the anointing the more it
33:41
grows just like a deposit in the savings
33:44
account the more you invest it you
33:46
invest the anointing by releasing it i'm
33:49
telling you then they're fighting stuff
33:51
that's they're wearing that they're
33:53
walking in it's fighting against the
33:55
darkness the very darkness i can tell
33:57
you what the demons will stop wanting to
33:59
be around them just because they're
34:00
being invaded by the anointing so there
34:03
are things you can do
34:05
nothing is hopeless okay not when jesus
34:08
christ is involved it says remember all
34:11
things are possible with god that thing
34:13
yeah you are dangerous when you're born
34:16
again and i know they don't teach you in
34:18
church this but they should they should
34:20
have classes uh like anointing classes
34:23
or something somebody should start a
34:24
class up and if you're listening right
34:26
now you have the ability to start
34:28
something why don't you start a class
34:30
about john 2 27 about the anointing that
34:32
abides in all of us that christ put that
34:35
deposit in there and if you begin to use
34:37
it you can change anything
34:40
oh i have a quick story to tell people
34:42
about why i said the shoes
34:45
this is this is a true story and i went
34:47
somewhere to speak and i was training i
34:49
trained the whole church at one time on
34:50
how to release the anointing you know
34:52
how easy it is you just teach them to do
34:54
it
34:55
you read the scripture you tell them
34:57
what the anointing is and and you get
34:59
people to answer this question the
35:00
anointing breaks uh and every christian
35:03
will say the yoke but they don't know
35:05
what that means okay then you explain it
35:08
is it is the power of christ's anointing
35:10
he operated in the more you release it
35:13
i can go like this like i release
35:16
i actually feel it not just coming from
35:18
my hands but my whole body wow okay
35:21
you're the wave of it
35:23
every anointing out there to break any
35:26
yoke of darkness in jesus name
35:28
everybody's anointing to open up the
35:31
passages uh to hear jesus christ better
35:34
to know him better in jesus name
35:37
the more you release it you will begin
35:40
to feel it leave you
35:42
which is why without even jesus looking
35:45
and that woman touched the hem of his
35:47
garment he said i felt virtue or i felt
35:49
power leave me
35:52
that was the anointing
35:54
and so this story was really quick we
35:56
had a report from somebody
35:58
who kept steps meeting one time and said
36:00
his brother all of a sudden became
36:03
distant became hateful
36:06
uh he didn't live with him but he lived
36:08
he was just a real wealthy person in the
36:10
city this was his brother was wealthy
36:12
and all of a sudden he got caught off in
36:14
the things became bitter and angry i
36:16
couldn't stand his brother who was the
36:18
believer
36:20
and then he finally lost his business
36:22
and he and he didn't have a job he
36:24
didn't have money or anything
36:26
but he always admired these cowboy boots
36:29
that his brother owned
36:31
and so his his wife and he kept praying
36:33
about what to do about it and then they
36:36
came to my meeting
36:38
and they heard me share about releasing
36:40
an anointing in the articles of things
36:42
for the people
36:43
so they decided they were going to do a
36:45
covert operation with this brother of
36:47
his who was looking for work he actually
36:50
was a landscape architect and so he
36:53
finally came to his brother and said i
36:54
don't have any money can i mow your lawn
36:56
he's an architect right and he wants to
36:58
just mow the lawn to have food
37:00
so they they had prayed over the boots
37:03
the night before
37:04
and left them but right inside the front
37:07
door so when this guy left he had to
37:09
pass those boots and i mean they laid
37:12
their hands that released anointing that
37:13
breaks a yoke of darkness according to
37:16
first john 2 27 thank you for correcting
37:18
me holy spirit first john 2 27 released
37:21
that anointing they both did it in jesus
37:23
name to break the yoke of darkness over
37:25
my brother
37:26
well sure enough he came he mowed the
37:28
lawn and his brother said is there
37:30
anything else i can do i really want to
37:32
help you and he said no i don't need
37:34
your help and then he looks over and
37:35
there's those boots sitting right inside
37:37
the front door
37:39
and he goes well
37:40
there is one thing
37:42
i really like those boots
37:45
and i need new shoes and his brother
37:47
said well you may take them
37:50
so he took those cowboy boots
37:54
and i'm not i'm not exaggerating one
37:56
week later
37:59
this brother comes back saying
38:01
i don't know why i've been so mean to
38:03
you i'm so sorry he said i'm overwhelmed
38:07
that these boots are the best thing i've
38:08
ever owned
38:11
when i'm wearing them he said i'm happy
38:13
all the time and he said i was wondering
38:16
would you pray with me just because of
38:18
that i ask you
38:20
he said would you pray with me and so
38:21
they prayed with him and said god open
38:23
doors for him you know uh to know you
38:26
better to hear you better and to show
38:29
that you love him give him something he
38:31
had that's better that he had before
38:35
three days later he shows back up still
38:38
wearing the boots saying you're not
38:40
gonna believe this he said i had an old
38:42
client call me and i have been given all
38:46
of these buildings at the building to
38:48
design all the landscape for this whole
38:51
entire development he said i'm going to
38:53
make millions i mean he was like crying
38:56
he said i'm giving myself back to jesus
38:58
christ if he cares that much for me it's
39:00
not worth it to hang on to the darkness
39:02
and i can tell you what why did that
39:04
happen
39:05
because the anointing broke that yoke of
39:08
darkness that was
39:10
them and that's what they did they just
39:13
reached out to him let him know that
39:14
they care about him and so they were so
39:17
overwhelmed about i used to tell a story
39:19
a lot so overwhelmed that no one can
39:21
convince them that the anointing doesn't
39:24
work it does work
39:26
and so that did now he's back at this
39:28
guy's been in business for some time now
39:31
and his business has only grown his
39:32
landscape business is way beyond what he
39:34
ever had before just what they prayed so
39:37
don't give up on your family members
39:40
even though they may sound crazy act
39:41
crazy they may say they hate you i can
39:44
tell you what that's the enemy speaking
39:46
because somewhere inside of their spirit
39:48
is still the all the deposits of the
39:50
love you showed them and the love that
39:52
they gave to you that's still somewhere
39:54
in their soul
39:56
don't give up on them don't stop
39:58
declaring that they will be free but
40:01
make sure you're sending holy spirit to
40:03
pursue them because when you choose to
40:05
love i love us in valentine's week
40:09
yeah when you choose to love and not
40:12
strike back even though they're being
40:14
hateful and mean and you know
40:16
i will say this don't ever stay in a
40:18
dangerous situation you don't want i'm
40:20
not telling you to do that if someone is
40:22
being
40:23
horribly violent raging violent uh you
40:26
might have to call the police and that
40:28
sounds hard but sometimes that's where
40:29
people find jesus i'm telling you so i'm
40:33
not saying that but i'm saying just in a
40:34
situation where you know people have are
40:36
involved in things that are wrong
40:38
they're beginning to change them you can
40:40
totally do that okay you take authority
40:43
over the enemy who's doing this uh make
40:45
sure you lose any fear from yourself so
40:48
that you can have clarity in hearing
40:50
what god has to say but i do know this
40:52
is a thing that we have done our lives
40:54
all of my family we've taught other
40:56
people to do it so we've been involved
40:58
in situations and other people or been
41:01
told of them we know this works
41:04
you are powerfully and wonderfully made
41:05
as a believer and jesus will never leave
41:08
you he will always be there with you so
41:11
don't get angry at god because your
41:13
family members decided to go rogue and
41:15
go crazy
41:17
you can do something about it do you
41:19
covert with christ take authority over
41:21
that darkness begin to have it pulled
41:23
down in jesus name then begin to release
41:26
the anointing into their life or into
41:28
their things that they wear as they lay
41:30
on if you buy them a coke release into
41:33
the coke before you give it to them
41:35
there's all kinds of things that you can
41:36
do in different ways you can think of
41:39
that that anointing as long as they're
41:40
wearing it or near it will begin to
41:43
break that yolk
41:44
when people get trapped in something
41:46
like that
41:48
i pretty much know people who are there
41:50
literally is a yoke put around them
41:53
they carry a yoke it becomes a burden a
41:56
dreadful burden it will drag them down
41:59
that's why it's called a yoke and yet
42:01
the anointing breaks every yoke it
42:04
breaks the darkness and then begin to
42:07
speak against the enemy that that they
42:09
will be blinded that they will have
42:11
their mouth shut and i've seen sometimes
42:13
angels go up and they just go like this
42:14
zip the demon's mouth and the spirit
42:18
they can't even give thoughts to that
42:20
person because once satan gets a hook in
42:23
you every every time he can he'll have
42:26
an opportunity to say horrible things
42:28
crushing things against people against
42:31
their family members
42:33
and then you know what the devil will do
42:35
then he'll beat them up with how cruel
42:37
they were i mean you don't win at all
42:39
with the enemy he'll use you okay and
42:42
then he'll use yourself against you
42:44
whatever he can do but there is power in
42:47
the blood power in the word power in you
42:51
as a believer in jesus christ release
42:53
that anointing speak against the
42:55
darkness
42:56
don't my brother used to say don't let
42:58
satan see you wince don't let satan see
43:01
you step back let him see you go bowl me
43:04
forward and who you are
43:06
the authority jesus christ gave us
43:08
and your family member
43:10
will not miss being in heaven being with
43:14
you in eternity and i've heard many
43:15
people in heaven say thank you for not
43:18
giving up on me
43:19
thank you for not giving up for standing
43:21
in the gap for me and i want to say one
43:24
more thing when you begin to do that do
43:26
not speak bad against your family
43:29
remember like don't go telling people
43:30
all the stuff they're doing right now
43:32
well i paid for them but they're still
43:33
doing this and now they're doing this
43:35
you make the situation that's not a
43:37
testimony by the way that's just a sad
43:39
story a testimony is but you you have
43:42
victory because of the blood of the lamb
43:45
the victory
43:46
and the word of your testimony is part
43:49
of the victories how victory is created
43:51
that's why i tell people in this time
43:53
celebrate eat cake in the face of the
43:56
enemy
43:57
tell you piercing the heart of the enemy
44:00
when he sees you not just being strong
44:02
and faithful but actually still enjoying
44:05
your life that god put you here for a
44:08
purpose and your family member should
44:10
not steal your joy
44:12
steal your plans steal your future from
44:15
you
44:16
and me would like to take everybody down
44:18
but i can tell you he's about to go down
44:20
really hard the enemy is and so much
44:22
stuff will be broken off people but you
44:25
have authority especially over your
44:27
family members even grandchildren who
44:29
don't live with you you can take
44:30
authority over the atmosphere they're
44:32
living in it's in the army of heaven in
44:34
there send holy spirit in there and
44:36
every time you visit them make sure you
44:38
release the anointing in their home and
44:40
even without you being there this is the
44:42
thing about the anointing it will never
44:45
wear off
44:46
and you can't wash them all and it will
44:49
never get old that's good you'll never
44:51
get old so that's why it says in the
44:54
word first john 2 27 it abides in you
44:58
there you go there you go now can i have
45:00
just one question about this and then
45:02
you'd said a number of times don't give
45:04
up don't give up don't give up
45:06
and which that's awesome to know that
45:09
that's the that's the instruction and
45:11
then at one point you said do it for at
45:13
least a week do that do that
45:15
um and so my question is kind of in the
45:17
time factor deuce can two people
45:20
seemingly do the same
45:22
uh prophetic not just acts but they do
45:24
that they send the host they send the
45:26
anointing they do all those things and
45:28
one person might get a breakthrough in a
45:30
week and the next person might take six
45:32
months or what would you say about that
45:36
i would say absolutely it depends on the
45:38
will of the person
45:40
it depends on the nature and the will of
45:42
that person if they're more even in the
45:44
natural even in the natural before they
45:46
got involved in this stuff if if they
45:48
were really strong-willed person it
45:51
might take a little bit longer for them
45:54
them to give
45:56
given to the holy spirit or given to
45:58
the thoughts them that are being put in
46:00
there by the army of heaven by their own
46:02
angels you know once you break that
46:04
stronghold off of somebody it does say
46:07
that our weapons they are mighty to the
46:10
pulling down of strongholds which tells
46:12
you those strongholds are they're
46:14
demonic beings trying to control the
46:16
mind uh the appetite uh what they what
46:20
people see what they watch what they get
46:22
involved in that's what a stronghold is
46:25
most people walk through the walks of
46:26
the day and every now and then the enemy
46:28
will come against them or something you
46:30
know every now and then but then there's
46:32
some people who god has a very divine
46:34
destiny for that the enemy sets on
46:37
purpose a stronghold which means several
46:40
demonic beings are assigned to that
46:42
person
46:43
bombard them or drag them off into doing
46:45
things get them upset get them angry
46:48
when they are pulled down
46:50
when they're pulled down away from them
46:52
that impact that continual bombardment
46:55
will stop
46:56
it will stop it's very powerful to see
46:58
that happen in the spirit so it's just
47:01
knowing what to do
47:03
yes because of the nature of a person or
47:05
their will
47:07
but this is what god says to me god says
47:09
i love strong-willed people and i'll
47:11
tell you why because they may be even on
47:13
the wrong track but when i get them and
47:16
i get them where i want them to be
47:18
nobody or nothing will ever pull them
47:21
off that track
47:23
so knowing you have a strong-willed
47:25
child that's probably god made them that
47:27
way
47:28
you may have to pay for a little bit
47:30
more as they grow up in your shaping i
47:32
tell people you're not raising children
47:34
you're shaping souls for the kingdom
47:36
uh the soul so much about the soul
47:38
almost everything we go through that's
47:40
why it's talked about it's called the
47:42
heart
47:44
because it's the core of your being your
47:46
soul is actually inside your spirit man
47:48
is part of it so your soul your spirit
47:51
man and then your body
47:53
you are a living soul
47:55
and guess what what you say
47:57
right now in your own life even in the
47:59
next minutes what you say choose to say
48:02
every day will impact your own soul and
48:04
the soul of everybody around you
48:07
so rather than yelling and screaming at
48:09
your family members who are doing these
48:11
crazy things
48:12
it's so much more powerful just to say i
48:15
can't approve of what you're doing and i
48:17
know it's not right you need to consider
48:19
what you're doing but i want you to know
48:21
i love you it's always important to say
48:23
that you love them because that begins
48:25
to pierce the enemy the enemy does not
48:28
want anyone to love
48:30
and i'm not saying like is that i'm not
48:32
saying that you they you should stand
48:33
and let you be beat you up either i'm
48:35
not saying that
48:36
i'm saying one of your other greatest
48:38
weapons is love it says in the bible it
48:40
is the strongest thing god made and when
48:43
you say i love you to people it actually
48:45
goes to a special place in their soul
48:48
and it will they will hear those words
48:50
over and over and over even with the
48:52
assault of the enemy that they the enemy
48:55
at one point will not be able to
48:57
convince that person that they are not
48:59
loved and that is one of the number one
49:01
weapons the enemy does is make you once
49:03
you get you isolated to the drugs or the
49:05
alcohol he'll begin to tell people
49:07
nobody loves you nobody cares about you
49:09
but if you've made deposits into that
49:12
person
49:13
that's what the holy spirit will begin
49:15
bring back to their memories
49:16
so it does matter what you say and it
49:19
does matter what you do in your life
49:22
because every day we either demonstrate
49:24
the power of god or we demonstrate and
49:26
manifest the assaults of the enemy
49:29
against us and others and that's been
49:31
very impactful to me when you've taught
49:33
this and other people have taught this
49:35
to not only you but yes where they'll
49:37
say and some people will say well go to
49:39
the courts of heaven and do business
49:41
with god but then they'll say but don't
49:43
come back
49:44
and just start badmouthing the very
49:46
people you were just praying and i'm
49:48
thinking why didn't i think of that you
49:50
know so because we're so tempted to say
49:52
oh look what they're doing now yesterday
49:55
they did you know but you're saying
49:57
don't use those
49:59
lips and and tonight
50:02
well you're being double-minded right
50:03
steve that's double-minded and it says
50:05
if you're double-minded you will get
50:07
what from the lord nothing nothing
50:11
so don't bring all your all your efforts
50:14
and you might not see anything like that
50:17
day or the next day but i will promise
50:19
you this there are things happening in
50:22
the unseen realm that you cannot see
50:24
that are so powerful and so crushing to
50:28
the planes of the enemy number one they
50:30
can't even they can't really believe
50:31
that you're making a stand or you know
50:33
how to make a stand because satan's
50:36
pretty much done whatever you wanted to
50:37
in this world that's coming to an end
50:40
and actually will become isolated in in
50:43
areas as i've spoken before because of
50:46
the understanding of the body of christ
50:48
number one coming together
50:50
loving one another but operating the way
50:53
god gave us the right to and christ gave
50:55
us actually a commission to do the
50:58
darkness will be pushed back i'm not
51:00
saying it'd be wiped off it'd be pushed
51:02
back and such freedom will come to
51:04
operate in the gospel of the kingdom and
51:07
in many other ways in our own lives that
51:10
no one has experienced even in the past
51:12
at all so understanding that you're made
51:14
by god for a purpose
51:16
and your words are very important to him
51:19
and it says if you ask for something you
51:21
do not doubt in your heart
51:23
doubting is speaking against the very
51:25
thing you just asked for
51:28
so yeah your words are powerful your
51:30
words are powerful it says you shall
51:31
have whatsoever you say you should eat
51:34
the food of your lips you know i could
51:35
go down this long line of scriptures but
51:38
those those it doesn't mean something so
51:40
when you make a stand it says stand
51:42
there for that means you're not gonna go
51:44
back don't go back on what your
51:46
declaration was even if they get meaner
51:48
even if they get crazier you keep
51:51
bombarding that's why i said at least
51:52
once a week speak over this situation
51:55
and if it's real serious i would say at
51:57
least once a day i'm saying maybe take
52:00
five minutes 10 minutes i'm not saying
52:02
you have to pray all night long uh god
52:05
can hear your words what you're doing is
52:08
ruling it says that we are kings and
52:10
priesthoods who are god will a king a
52:13
spiritual king rules and around
52:16
and one of the greatest realms is you
52:18
have greater authority in the spirit
52:20
standing and declaring over your family
52:22
members than anyone else so make sure
52:25
that you're not just you're standing but
52:27
when you're standing you're ruling
52:29
you're doing something about it by doing
52:31
covert activity by declaring against the
52:34
darkness you're not going to tolerate
52:36
the actions against your family member
52:38
that you've loved them you're standing
52:40
for their salvation to be true and that
52:43
they'll be with you in eternity these
52:45
words are very powerful
52:47
not just in your own life because every
52:49
time you say them they go in your own
52:50
soul and that gives you you build your
52:52
faith it says it you know you build
52:54
yourself up in most holy faith if you
52:57
pray in tongues make sure you also spend
52:59
part of that time praying in tongues for
53:00
your family member but let me tell you
53:03
jesus has not given up on them
53:05
and i know that the word says he desires
53:07
even the vilest sinner
53:09
should be free he wants them free i know
53:12
not everyone will be i just have to say
53:15
that to you but give every chance
53:18
possible for your family member and i'll
53:21
say this even if they pass away and you
53:24
don't get to hear from them
53:25
that was not done in vain
53:29
even in the spirit at that moment of
53:31
death if you have made a stand for your
53:33
family member jesus has keys
53:35
and that's the keys of hell death and
53:38
the grave and those keys give him
53:40
permission to go into that place i'm not
53:43
saying as they've been dead for months
53:45
and years i'm not saying that i'm saying
53:47
at that moment and all this going on
53:50
around you like right now in your life
53:53
you made the stand
53:54
and god has every right to use the very
53:57
words you made for your family member
53:59
but if all you do is uh you know bash
54:02
them all the time or you're given uh it
54:04
says whatever is a good report that's
54:06
what you give so if people say well
54:08
what's going on with your crazy family
54:09
remember now you go they're getting
54:11
healed they're going to change in jesus
54:13
name i'm making a stand you know and if
54:16
they don't give up if they still want to
54:18
go on around say why don't you take my
54:19
hand and pray for them right now
54:22
i promise you they won't hang around you
54:24
to hear a good report
54:25
yeah yeah that's really good cat that's
54:28
thinking well we have uh other questions
54:30
but this was the most important question
54:32
today that we hit that was so important
54:34
um let me ask this first one kind of as
54:37
a cousin a little bit to what you've
54:39
been saying but this woman named jan
54:41
asks she works at a place where she
54:43
hears
54:44
she says i hear secular music all day
54:46
long every day at my job obviously she
54:49
has no choice in the matter she goes how
54:51
can i guard my ear gates
54:53
when it's
54:55
playing what would you say to her
54:57
oh there is so something so simple that
55:00
you can do i do that even when i go into
55:03
places you know
55:05
you do very simple before you leave to
55:07
go in there you say i lift up and do an
55:09
action i lift up my shield of faith to
55:12
quench every fiery dart of the enemy and
55:15
the music
55:16
even though your ear is here it will not
55:18
enter into your soul uh this is
55:20
something the holy spirit uh he took me
55:22
um
55:23
you know armor by a piece of armor uh
55:26
even the scriptures about the armor this
55:28
revelation on all that which is part of
55:30
the spirit force stuff that you'll be
55:31
getting uh the shield of faith you know
55:33
you're you're shot with the the
55:35
preparation the gospel piece these are
55:37
powerful things to have
55:40
we are in the army of god it says so it
55:44
says to be a
55:45
good soldier we are in the army of god
55:47
on the earth we're his army on the earth
55:49
he has an army he sends from heaven
55:51
that's heaven's army that works together
55:54
with us but you yourself you're in an
55:56
army right now and you have weapons and
55:59
part of the weapons are what you put on
56:01
to wear but one of the most usable ones
56:04
i use is that shield of faith if i'm
56:07
going into a meeting where i know
56:08
there's going to be a lot of unsafe
56:10
people
56:11
you know i don't want to go up there and
56:12
slap them in their faces or use
56:14
profanity
56:18
more likely to not i would say excuse me
56:20
but i can't let those words go into my
56:22
soul now most people aren't going to
56:24
argue with me if i say that you'd be
56:25
surprised who does swear sometimes
56:28
by the way profanity is hell's language
56:30
just so you know that yeah it matters
56:32
that you don't use it
56:34
but like the but but the enemy does
56:36
travel
56:37
he uses music he uses uh and not all
56:40
secular music is bad just so you know
56:42
that everybody thinks if it's not
56:44
bringing in the sheaves you probably
56:46
don't even know what that is
56:47
it would not bring questions our
56:49
generation
56:51
you know
56:54
or i'm gonna fly you know i'll fly away
56:56
please these are from these these songs
56:58
from 50 years ago now maybe 60 years ago
57:00
let's go back here
57:03
but you know uh uh all the powerful and
57:06
i can tell you having lived in that
57:07
whole time frame of the 50s and the 60s
57:10
and the 70s the 80s and 90s i've heard
57:12
every level of christian music and you
57:15
so much better off today than you were
57:20
i remember i can't even remember the
57:21
call letters of the one radio station we
57:23
had in jacksonville that was christian
57:26
it was country bless her heart
57:28
it was powerful back then but i wanted
57:31
to fly away and find something else to
57:33
listen to
57:34
but when you're in this situation and i
57:36
can tell you what just so you know this
57:38
um make sure you're not listening to new
57:42
age music please don't play new age
57:44
music know what you're listening to now
57:46
if you get a choice yourself for what to
57:48
listen to
57:49
um let's just say i could use michael
57:52
jackson's example he's in heaven whether
57:53
you like it or not he does not sing the
57:56
same songs
57:57
you have to understand that you may like
57:59
a artist this is important to say this
58:01
you may like a recording artist you
58:03
don't even know what's in the song
58:04
they're singing if he was here right now
58:05
he'd say please don't listen to the old
58:07
music
58:09
but some of those movies especially in
58:11
the 60s
58:12
they carry drug-related stuff in them
58:14
they carry
58:15
hidden messages in them
58:18
if you're in a place where you can't
58:20
stop that please say i lift up my shield
58:23
of faith that will quench every fiery
58:24
dart of the enemy in this music and it
58:27
will not affect me if you want to if you
58:30
want to know the full thing to say
58:32
but remember to lift up your shield of
58:33
faith literally in the spirit you have a
58:36
shield because of what covers up your
58:38
soul
58:38
and and nothing anybody's saying will
58:40
penetrate that
58:42
but that isn't a one-time thing okay
58:44
every day is a new day it talks about a
58:46
new day uh but there's some times that i
58:49
actually use that shield of faith
58:52
and i'll walk out of a place knowing
58:53
none of that stuff stayed in me so that
58:56
is what you need to do if you're working
58:57
in a place where they play stuff over
58:59
the over the music system whatever that
59:01
is
59:02
and now they can play just back in the
59:04
day they had piped in music that was
59:05
they called elevator music yeah yeah
59:07
sleep probably not
59:09
you
59:10
but today with their ability to play
59:13
anything anywhere you go even songs you
59:16
would never play the step you feel the
59:18
face it will crunch every one of those
59:20
words or hidden agendas in those words
59:23
or the songs
59:25
that would try to affect you that's good
59:27
i want to ask the question i had asked
59:29
robin about celebrities as hollywood
59:31
actors and got to give me a prophetic
59:33
dream he even named this specific
59:36
actress you know who it is in fact i'll
59:38
just tell you who it was it was it's gal
59:40
gadot
59:41
who does wonder one well god told me in
59:44
this dream that she was she had an
59:46
experience is in the middle of
59:48
experience of seeking god now that may
59:50
take a generation for her to to receive
59:54
but god god gave me that as a share so
59:57
my question is well while we watched
59:59
these uh and see these actors and
60:02
actresses and robin had made a point the
60:04
other day that
60:06
in our generation all the actors knew
60:07
god they just might have chosen not to
60:09
serve him but they knew him or they knew
60:11
who he was he said this generation of
60:13
actors must have never even heard the
60:15
story of god and they have to be taught
60:17
that first
60:19
so my question is how do everything
60:21
we've been talking about the anointing
60:23
obviously most people watching this
60:25
don't have any you know they can't give
60:27
cowboy boots or they can't give a card
60:30
what
60:31
uh what what would you instruct people
60:34
who i know there's a lot of people who
60:35
who feel called to pray for for many of
60:38
those well-known
60:39
uh actors or celebrities or those who
60:41
work with them how
60:43
would they go about interceding or
60:45
declaring or decreeing for those that
60:47
god puts on their heart
60:49
i would definitely the first thing yeah
60:52
there's actually some that i pray for
60:53
all the time
60:54
and because actually just so you know
60:57
this there is a group in hollywood who
60:59
for 45 years have had a list of actors
61:03
and actresses that they they as a group
61:06
pray for uh even this this group of
61:09
people aren't just in hollywood there
61:10
are many places there's hundreds and
61:12
hundreds of people that pray over this
61:15
list and they actually call out their
61:16
name it's important to always call out
61:18
the name when you're praying for
61:19
somebody
61:20
uh
61:22
i know barbara i don't want to say her
61:24
last name i don't know you know how much
61:26
we're allowed to say about people or
61:27
whatever but on this list are very well
61:30
known directors people in the movie
61:32
industry it's hollywood right so there's
61:34
directors the scriptwriters
61:36
screenwriters actors actresses
61:39
people who do special effects there's a
61:41
list of all these people
61:42
god gave them those gifts he made them
61:45
that gift
61:46
and that's why they're powerful that's
61:48
why they're good but he does want them
61:49
to know him and i would say the most
61:51
important thing you do is declare those
61:53
very words we'll just use mickey mouse
61:56
as an example
61:57
by the way walt disney isn't heaven
62:00
people awesome awesome that's great so i
62:02
always tell people people mickey mouse
62:04
made it to heaven
62:07
that's good
62:08
so we'll just use mickey mouse right you
62:10
would say father i just declare mickey
62:12
mouse will know
62:14
jesus christ i declare he'll know him
62:16
he'll become a christian uh that he will
62:18
not lose the destiny he was chosen for
62:21
in jesus name and i come against all the
62:24
power of hell that is kept in bondage i
62:27
release the anointing into that
62:29
situation that that yoke will be broken
62:32
off of them and i think this is pretty
62:35
much what most of the people do that
62:36
pray over a lot of people uh these most
62:39
people are known
62:40
uh some of them are not very good at all
62:43
and i will say this people who are a
62:45
gift or have a powerful gift the only
62:48
reason they put up dark content
62:51
is because that is what's inside of them
62:54
god said i made them a gift they're the
62:56
people who are cold he said hot or cold
62:59
or whether you have to be hot or cold if
63:01
you lukewarm i can't use you which means
63:04
i'll spew you out of my mouth
63:07
huh is a believer
63:09
operating in the gift he gave you on
63:11
purp and that doesn't mean i mean that
63:13
could be a baker not just a singer or a
63:15
preacher or a five-fold ministry
63:17
whatever he made you as a that gift he
63:19
gave you you are a gift every good and
63:22
perfect gift that's us
63:24
comes down from the father of lights we
63:26
were the little lights the spirits
63:28
living inside of him and that's what
63:30
that means that's revelation but but we
63:33
have the right because we are
63:36
representing jesus christ in this earth
63:38
to declare over certain people of course
63:40
always so you have to pray first and
63:43
take authority over the darkness
63:44
consuming them because obviously it is
63:46
consuming him that they'll be free from
63:49
that release the anointing on their
63:51
behalf so i release the anointing on
63:52
behalf of
63:54
mickey mouse or barbara or whoever else
63:56
is out there uh you know that that they
63:59
will know jesus christ because your
64:01
words are powerful they create
64:04
something in the spirit realm uh whether
64:07
you're related to people or not i know
64:09
we did talk mainly about family members
64:10
but this is true for anybody
64:13
and i've seen some of these people in
64:14
heaven that people had on this list to
64:16
pray for so yes you make a difference
64:19
you absolutely make a difference and
64:22
and like uh mainly what happens in
64:24
hollywood the way they operated in the
64:26
past was they would find people who are
64:28
highly gifted get them involved in
64:30
hollywood get them on drugs get them on
64:33
alcohol
64:34
the first thing they would want to do is
64:36
pull christ away from them if they were
64:38
a christian they certainly don't want
64:40
that scene or known if they're popular
64:42
and well liked they don't want them to
64:44
be drawn to that part of that person
64:46
although there are some really good
64:47
actors and actresses unless we can say
64:49
it on both sides that are born again and
64:52
are still making an impact in hollywood
64:55
um
64:56
uh who never even got caught into the
64:58
darkness once again
64:59
if you want to send somebody there and
65:01
it's your child you better be going with
65:03
them okay you better not let just have
65:05
your child go and be involved in the
65:07
area of that situation just because it
65:09
looks good for their good for their
65:12
destiny or something like that
65:15
you don't want that to be taken or
65:16
ruined or spoiled so make sure that's
65:19
covered to make sure that jesus is
65:21
involved and and i i i talk to people
65:24
quite often about that they've had a
65:26
door open for them with a certain
65:27
situation or this group and yet they're
65:29
wicked
65:31
you don't want to go there god's not
65:33
feeding you to the devil okay he didn't
65:36
give you that gift
65:37
you do what you can with it for others
65:39
or use it for him in any way you can but
65:42
don't sell out
65:44
thinking you can impact them with that
65:47
gift
65:48
99 of the time that is not what happened
65:51
and i mean i've sat in a shop in
65:53
hollywood i saw the
65:56
warlocks and witches
65:58
sitting in this place with groups of
66:00
young people influencing them and and
66:03
saying things over them and when i
66:05
walked in that door they all turned and
66:07
looked at me really i didn't see
66:09
anything it was a starbucks i walked in
66:12
because it was the only place i'd get a
66:13
hot chocolate but i know if i'm going to
66:15
that place i'm going to do destruction
66:17
to the enemy i walked in that door
66:20
and there was a warlock sitting at this
66:22
table these young girls they probably
66:24
were like 17 18 years old wanted me
66:26
actresses
66:27
and he was mentoring them
66:30
and i walked in that door ooh i just
66:32
began i released the anointing like this
66:34
cloud started coming out of me and
66:36
instantly he came and
66:38
he he sat there turned his head and
66:40
looked like directly at me like that and
66:42
i would not look down i kept releasing
66:45
anointing the whole entire time
66:48
good for you i mean if you're born on me
66:50
like a river
66:52
wow
66:53
you know he did he turned around like
66:54
this
66:57
he dropped his eyes
66:59
he couldn't say anything to the girls
67:02
because of the presence of god that was
67:04
in that place and everyone in there who
67:06
was a wicked walked out
67:11
wow that's amazing in line with me and
67:14
some of them were were actors but they
67:16
were like wrestlemania people
67:19
yeah but they were believers they had a
67:21
lot i'm not saying every one of them are
67:23
but this these three kinds were huge
67:26
their arms are huge and they were
67:28
looking around like now they were
67:30
disgusted uh they were disgusted because
67:33
most people who who live or or work in
67:36
hollywood understand that's just what
67:38
the enemy does but they were big they
67:40
didn't want to say nothing to this guy
67:42
they they didn't know what he would say
67:43
back i didn't care
67:46
and all i did was release the anointing
67:48
and i was speaking under my breath and
67:49
all i know was he could not even look up
67:52
he couldn't move he couldn't say
67:54
anything the whole time i was and i was
67:56
declaring over all those girls breaking
67:58
under my breath breaking the yolk of
68:00
diamonds over every single one of them
68:02
you know that they would be free from
68:03
that they've been stepping into their
68:05
destiny and these guys could hear what i
68:07
was saying oh you were saying that
68:09
louder you were saying it loud enough to
68:11
actually i was thinking you know well
68:12
the guy was kind across the whole room
68:14
but
68:15
you know i was just saying father i take
68:17
power over all the power of the enemy
68:18
trying to affect these girls in jesus
68:19
name i break that yoke of darkness over
68:21
them in jesus name and i look and here's
68:23
this guy sitting next to me he's got the
68:24
biggest grin on him
68:27
he's shaking his head yeah yeah
68:30
so you can be a light no matter where
68:32
you go and god had margaret stop and i
68:35
said margaret you i got to go in that
68:37
shop you know to get me it wasn't for my
68:40
hot chocolate it was because of the
68:42
impact that would make over those girls
68:44
lives and i know it was when they left
68:46
there were little darts in them that had
68:48
the light of god on them
68:50
and so you make a difference by the way
68:53
you live your life but i'm not
68:55
tolerating darkness anywhere near me and
68:58
that should be something you say when
69:00
you wake up in the morning okay i will
69:02
not tolerate darkness operating around
69:04
me against me against my family in jesus
69:07
name
69:08
because that's called ruling and you're
69:10
taking authority in the spirit realm
69:12
before you even get anywhere and it says
69:15
you know if you submit yourself under
69:16
the hand of god and you resist the devil
69:19
guess what i'm doing i'm resisting him
69:21
by saying those words guess what he
69:23
flees from you
69:24
yeah
69:26
kat that the whole thing about ruling is
69:27
very interesting because all
69:29
through my years and i'm 66 now but i
69:32
was here teaching after teaching about
69:34
you don't know what authority you have
69:36
in christ and they would say you don't
69:39
know the authority you have a christ you
69:40
know you have more authority but nobody
69:43
ever
69:44
until i met you let's just say it that
69:46
way
69:47
said you take this authority and you
69:50
rule with it i don't yes because i never
69:53
got up expecting to rule that day and i
69:56
believe you do am i
69:58
is that true you get up expecting to
70:00
rule
70:01
i do
70:03
i go i rule before i go to bed and when
70:05
i get in the morning i'm going to rule
70:07
well guess what if you're a king
70:09
let's just say in the natural you're a
70:11
king do you ignore your realm that you
70:14
live in you let an enemy come in and
70:16
take over and harm people or do things
70:18
do you let them come in and steal your
70:20
stuff no
70:22
you are a king unto your god it says you
70:26
will rule jesus christ now in this
70:28
lifetime and in the times to come it is
70:31
up to you to decide do you want to take
70:34
authority do you want to be dangerous
70:37
against hell i don't care if you're 14
70:39
years old sitting in a room somewhere
70:41
you're a believer you have the right to
70:44
rule by what you say and by the choices
70:46
you make yourself you can't go play in
70:48
the enemy's camp why are you walking in
70:51
there giving him ammunition against you
70:53
you're a strong believer you know you go
70:55
to church you give your times you help
70:57
people you love people but what are you
70:59
doing beside that okay
71:01
you you take these levels of authority
71:04
it says that it says the violent take it
71:07
by force from the enemy that doesn't
71:10
mean you have spears and guns and are
71:12
killing people that means you're ruling
71:14
with the words you choose to take the
71:16
authority that the bible gives you that
71:18
jesus gives you and you're speaking them
71:21
into the spirit realm where that's where
71:23
you rule we can't go in this physical
71:25
realm that's what most people want to do
71:27
they like to go wipe everybody out and
71:29
just get rid of them but you know it
71:31
doesn't matter if you get rid of the
71:33
people the evil presence the demonic are
71:36
going to stay right where they are doing
71:38
what they want to unless we decide to
71:41
take authority everywhere we go and
71:43
you're right i expect it to happen
71:47
i expect the enemy to run i expect him
71:50
to let go expect him to be to be harmed
71:54
and crushed and pushed back that's why
71:57
we have light in us and when i see
71:59
people with light blinding out of them i
72:01
know that they're ruling it's not about
72:03
how old you are what church you go to it
72:06
depends on are you a blood-bought
72:08
believer of jesus christ that you have
72:10
the right to not tolerate darkness and
72:13
whatever you do don't participate with
72:16
it there's a difference in participation
72:18
and toleration you're not tolerating it
72:20
yet you'll go into places and watch
72:22
already movies and stuff you shouldn't
72:24
be you're going into the camp of the
72:26
enemy you're trying to take authority
72:27
over do you think they're going to
72:29
listen to you
72:31
you can't play with the darkness and
72:34
then try to rule over it it says you
72:36
have to be free
72:38
free of all that stuff when jesus stood
72:40
there and said to them there's none of
72:42
him in me
72:44
that was jesus saying there's none of
72:45
the devil in me there's no darkness in
72:47
me there's no sin in me why because he
72:50
chose to live that way
72:55
well pal wow cat
72:58
wow
72:59
you know i could ask other questions but
73:00
i want to leave it at this point i don't
73:03
want i want that to sink in because
73:06
you know
73:07
we've got to learn to rule we got to
73:09
learn to do what you're teaching us to
73:10
do and you know me i'm not just blowing
73:12
smoke i actually mean that when i say
73:14
that i am hearing every word you're
73:17
saying and
73:19
goodness gracious we need to learn to
73:20
rule we're kings to our god i don't
73:23
think in cat i don't think we've been
73:25
trained
73:26
i was never trained that we're kings and
73:29
to our god
73:30
in the scripture the scripture says
73:32
we're kings and priests unto our god and
73:33
you go okay that's nice we're kings and
73:35
that's all it ever was was a nice
73:38
sounding scripture it didn't
73:40
carry
73:42
jesus did share the gospel
73:45
but what he talked about mostly was the
73:47
gospel of the kingdom
73:50
a spiritual kingdom that the king of
73:53
kings and lord of lords those spiritual
73:56
kings and those spiritual lords rule in
73:58
that kingdom in that spiritual kingdom
74:01
that's what he came to bring yes he came
74:04
for our salvation but he came for even
74:06
more than that
74:07
he expects us to take authority over
74:10
this darkness by all that he gave us
74:13
and if you sit in a corner and stay
74:15
afraid because fear is the enemy's
74:17
greatest weapon and all i have to say is
74:19
i choose to break that fear off of me in
74:21
jesus name i choose to break all
74:24
deception off of me i will not tolerate
74:26
it being a part of my life anymore i'm
74:29
running my race with jesus christ i will
74:31
rule and reign with him in this world i
74:34
will not let anything penetrate where i
74:37
live or where he sends me or control me
74:40
in any way because i serve the living
74:43
god and i will serve no other and father
74:46
right now i pray for everyone watching
74:48
right now that they be free from fear
74:51
free from deception free from confusion
74:54
in jesus name and i speak the life of
74:56
god the plans of god the power of god
75:00
let them have revelation and live and
75:02
rule and reign with you in this lifetime
75:06
to make those generations coming after
75:08
them even more powerful in the spirit
75:11
until there's a generation that will not
75:13
bow their knee bow their words to the
75:16
enemy but we as long as we're here will
75:18
be a threat and a danger to the plains
75:21
of the enemy that they will fail fail
75:24
fail and only what jesus christ wants
75:28
is what will be in jesus name amen wow
75:32
wildcat thank you thank you what an
75:34

76:50
i
76:51
don't do demons with a lightning bolt
76:53
that took them out of heaven
76:55
and so that's what our commission is it
76:58
is to reveal and create heaven on earth
77:00
and my greatest desire is to bless my
77:04
king jesus christ he is my number one
77:08
above all else and what he says is what
77:11
i say
77:12
and what he does is what i do and that
77:15
is my
77:16
my desire for you is to be so free of
77:20
any fear or anything holding you back
77:22
you were made for a purpose in this
77:25
world and he chose and timed your birth
77:27
on the earth you're not
77:29
you are not a mistake and remember he
77:32
holds us in his hands
77:36
and we will all if your desire is to
77:38
fulfill that purpose he has for you make
77:39
sure when he asks you to do something
77:42
you do it okay i have katper.com that's
77:45
a spiritual platform where you can get
77:47
all kinds of uh uh revelation and
77:50
there's uh q a sessions i think there's
77:52
probably some interviews on there we're
77:54
about to upgrade that one to have a lot
77:56
more content but um and it's the only
77:59
place you can give online i always tell
78:01
people don't believe these fake places
78:04
out there saying it's me
78:05
asking for money for some country or for
78:07
some project or plan or something that's
78:10
not me okay now i do want to say
78:12
something
78:13
if i travel i personally
78:16
never charge people to hear the
78:18
revelation that god has me give
78:20
not in any of our own meetings we
78:22
usually have four meetings a year in our
78:24
own city and there's never going to be a
78:26
charge to come but if i'm invited by
78:29
another ministry or place to come and
78:31
speak for them they may charge a fee and
78:34
let me tell you if a thousand people are
78:36
coming to their place that means they
78:38
have to hire more security more ushers
78:40
more people to clean up more people in
78:42
the parking lot and they have a right to
78:45
charge that fee yeah so that's not
78:47
that's not me saying i'm not going to
78:49
charge in another location
78:51
if they have to charge a small fee to
78:53
register that's probably also to make
78:55
sure you have a seat and they don't have
78:57
300 people saying they're coming and
78:59
they're not so
79:01
the gospel salvation is free
79:04
but it does cost money to preach
79:08
and have a place to keep it and present
79:10
it and i just want to clear that up uh
79:12
so but i myself god won't let me charge
79:15
you
79:16
or this revelation is freely given
79:19
because it's from the father from the
79:21
son from the holy spirit just make sure
79:24
you're loving somebody every day and i
79:26
love what somebody said i remember what
79:27
they said at least one person in a day
79:31
make them laugh
79:32
it's so powerful in the spirit laughing
79:35
in the spirit laughing is a weapon also
79:37
joy and laughter is a weapon
79:39
that's good cat
79:40

01:34
well hello and happy wednesday february
01:37
23 2022 nice to see you all we're
01:40
getting started close to our
01:41
11 o'clock hour we're trying to do that
01:43
right at the top of the hour and we're
01:45
we almost did it almost to the top but
01:47
we're we're i'm so excited to have a cat
01:49
back on this is uh wednesdays with
01:51
stephen cat or cat steve however we say
01:52
that it's going to be great
01:54
we've got loads of questions from you
01:56
all um we're going to try and get
01:58
through as many of them as we can
02:00
uh we're sorry for those of you who've
02:02
sent any questions and we you know we
02:03
probably asked several hundred
02:06
uh over the course of the of the year
02:09
year and a half however long we've been
02:10
doing this a year in a few months but uh
02:13
it takes a long time to get them all in
02:14
there so
02:15
we appreciate your patience and letting
02:17
us get to them when we can so let's see
02:20
a quick reminder to be sure you
02:21
subscribe to elijah.com
02:23
mainly so that after the show we will
02:25
then send the show to your inbox so you
02:28
can send it to others uh we put it in
02:30
the email and we put the links and the
02:32
pictures and the intro and all that and
02:34
the title of the show and then it's you
02:38
can send it to friends really quickly
02:40
rather than try and figure out how to
02:41
tell them to watch it
02:43
and giving them the link so this that
02:44
helps a lot so we really encourage you
02:46
to do that
02:47
um we haven't told you how to subscribe
02:50
to the youtube channel for a long time
02:51
so i will mention that so you go to
02:54
youtube.com and in their search box you
02:56
type in live streams either one or two
02:58
words and when it comes up along the
03:00
bottom you'll see this click the thumbs
03:02
up the red subscribe and the bell always
03:04
click it only when it's red otherwise
03:06
you would unsubscribe if you did that so
03:09
the thumbs up the red subscribe
03:11
and the bell if you if you click on it
03:13
when it's gray and you realize you
03:15
unsubscribe then just click it again and
03:17
you will have resubscribed so
03:19
all right i think that's all i'm here
03:22
alone my wife is here most times
03:25
uh as the show gets started but she's
03:27
babysitting our granddaughter as she
03:28
does one day a week and at their place
03:30
and it's a fun day for her
03:32
but on those days you'll know when
03:34
dreams aren't here because this thing's
03:36
dude usually she pins it back there for
03:38
me and then she goes on a walk and
03:39
listens to the show
03:41
while she walks but um
03:43
not to not on not when she's doing
03:45
babysitting so you'll know this is the
03:46
hat this is the truth if steve's cord is
03:49
hanging
03:50
he'll know doreen's gone so that's the
03:52
big reveal today all right well listen
03:55
let's bring in our friend kat kerr here
03:58
hey cat
03:59
hi there
04:00
so good to see you as always
04:04
yes it's good to see you doing so much
04:06
better i'm very excited for you that you
04:08
are doing something like that yeah it
04:09
was intense you know a lot of people
04:12
were saying when that omicron i can't
04:13
prove it was a homocrime because they
04:15
don't have a test that tells you if it's
04:17
own crime they just
04:18
so i never took a test
04:20
but they would say it was mild well it
04:22
wasn't mild for me and i i had literally
04:24
thought i had skipped around all of
04:26
these i wasn't getting it nothing you
04:28
know i was in a lot of things but you
04:30
know i got it
04:31
but uh we've got through it as i've told
04:33
people i'm now 10 pounds lighter and now
04:36
i'm going to keep this weight so that's
04:38
just that yeah that was hard weight loss
04:41
i always call that god's weight loss
04:42
program yeah it was i mean
04:45
one benefit that came out of it steve
04:47
they're ten thousand people so you know
04:50
what and there and there's other little
04:52
things like you hear people that they
04:53
had near death not that i was that way
04:55
but
04:56
after i was coming back and then the sun
04:59
here in the northwest we don't get a lot
05:00
of sun in the wintertime but god gave us
05:03
extra sunlight even today and
05:07
i found myself praising god i wasn't one
05:10
to always thank him for the son i mean
05:12
yeah i'm grateful for but now oh thank
05:14
you lord thank you lord i mean my
05:16
gratitude quotient whatever we call that
05:18
is much higher after this i'm just a
05:21
much more grateful person
05:23
awesome so it's important really to feel
05:25
gratitude one time i remember uh the
05:28
father talked to me for almost half a
05:30
day and this was probably
05:32
15 years ago he talked about gratitude
05:35
and he says so much of the body don't
05:38
even show gratitude and
05:41
from that day i have on purpose uh shown
05:44
gratitude and thanks for almost anything
05:46
really anything new especially but just
05:49
for the everyday things i thank him that
05:51
i'm here that he chose me and i get to
05:54
know all these people and i thank him
05:56
for whatever little bit of food i eat
05:58
especially if it's chocolate
06:02
well you know i'm drink this is
06:04
something that i experimented after
06:06
again when i was realizing gratitude was
06:07
coming to the surface i started saying
06:10
you know dream my wife drain is very
06:12
good at
06:13
asking the lord for a good parking space
06:15
let's see she's at costco and that's a
06:17
massive parking lot yeah and i'm
06:19
thinking well i don't know if god is
06:20
going to get that involved and i'm not a
06:22
negative nelly i just think
06:24
i just haven't done that and i watch it
06:26
keeps happening to her so i find it the
06:28
other day
06:30
i got up and i i didn't have a because i
06:32
don't go that many places we live on 20
06:34
acres and it's a big old farmhouse we're
06:36
not coop
06:37
but i i be the the sun wasn't coming
06:39
through and i said you know what lord
06:41
here's what i'm going to ask you to do
06:43
today because you do this for dream all
06:45
the time i just want you to part the
06:46
clouds because we are only we're going
06:48
to have clouds no sun the whole day
06:51
and let the sun come on over this farm
06:53
house and
06:57
you know darn it if that's not the right
06:59
word but i mean god did it
07:02
about halfway through the day the the
07:04
cloud split and we had some it was not
07:06
in the forecast there was no sun and i
07:09
started saying god that was you i know
07:11
that was you you and i stopped out you
07:14
know she's trained me a lot about little
07:16
things and asking does not mind blessing
07:18
us even in the simple things
07:20
we're we're usually so focused on making
07:22
sure that everything's taken care of
07:25
well let's just say the essentials
07:27
uh you know our bills are paid and we
07:29
have food and stuff like that a lot of
07:30
people they they need those things and
07:33
they do thank god for those but you know
07:35
you can ask for other things i ask for
07:38
fun all the time i say give me a fun day
07:40
or let me have fun or
07:42
i want to laugh a lot today
07:44
or i'm looking for something special
07:46
help me find it
07:49
and he will give you good parking spots
07:51
all the time if you ask
07:53
well no i'm really becoming an absolute
07:55
believer the other thing is i learned
07:57
this from you cat once you identified
07:59
holy spirit as the drama king that
08:01
heaven calls him that i ask him for
08:04
drama all the time and i'll say not bad
08:06
drama good drama surprisingly do
08:09
something
08:10
and i i do that and dreams learning from
08:13
me on that so we're teaching each other
08:14
you know but yeah that's great for some
08:17
reason that was easier for me to ask
08:18
don't ask me why but you know
08:21
well anyway cat we're here we've got a
08:23
lot of questions but
08:25
do you uh have a few thoughts to share
08:27
with us about current events or anything
08:29
that's on your mind before we get into
08:30
the questions so i'll just turn that
08:31
over to you if you've got anything to
08:33
share
08:34
i just know the father's been saying
08:36
start making plans for what your future
08:39
is um you don't have to wait this whole
08:42
thing just what i don't care if you call
08:43
it flip i don't care what you call it uh
08:46
restoration whatever god is in the
08:48
business of doing that and i know i can
08:50
tell you that from what he's doing with
08:52
me
08:52
what he's doing with me is my mind is
08:55
shifting from all the stuff that is
08:57
still around me into the very near
09:00
future and he has me talk about the
09:02
future to him and to many other people
09:04
i'm always talking about the future
09:06
which is like right around the corner
09:08
i'm not talking about five years ten
09:09
fifty a hundred years from now i could
09:11
talk about all those things but it's
09:13
like right now what's about to happen in
09:16
our lives is going to reflect and for
09:19
everyone else when we move you better
09:22
watch for a wave of acceleration you've
09:24
never seen before in your life because
09:26
the father is saying i need you in that
09:28
place i need you there acceleration is
09:30
so close right now
09:33
we're literally packing day and night we
09:35
have help help in this pack
09:37
so that we can move out of here because
09:39
of what is coming which is god which is
09:42
good it's the good stuff that's coming
09:44
people it's not all the demon gloom and
09:46
things people have been saying would
09:48
happen it's not that and i'm not this is
09:50
the thing that god has me say i am not
09:52
ignorant to any activities of hell i'm
09:55
just not going to advertise them okay
09:58
i will advertise what the father said
10:00
the other day though about the devil is
10:03
he's about to get the worst blow he's
10:05
ever experienced from his existence
10:07
and he said he's going to be crushed and
10:09
pushed back so far from all the stuff
10:12
going on and he is behind all of that i
10:14
mean people willingly have to say yes
10:16
and they do which is still mind-boggling
10:19
me
10:19
uh willing to accept what's going on is
10:22
okay or right in another one of those
10:25
god doesn't say it's okay it's totally
10:27
wrong it's evil it's wicked and god is
10:30
dealing with it so we who are still here
10:33
on the earth can run our race with such
10:35
acceleration with no no contending for
10:38
anything
10:40
when you step into a season of
10:42
acceleration and extravagance
10:45
you can't leave the extravagance out i
10:47
know people have done without or lost
10:48
things but in this season you're about
10:50
to step into it is going to be
10:52
extravagance all the way
10:54
wow wow and he says the devil is going
10:56
to take the biggest hit he's ever had
10:58
because he's lost part of his brain from
11:00
the lightning bolt that hit him when god
11:02
sent him out of heaven and he does say
11:03
that to me all the time
11:06
he doesn't think straight
11:08
he knows he has a plan
11:10
he gets it fully going
11:12
and the foundation is crumbling as he
11:14
adds layers of evil and wickedness the
11:16
foundation he thought he had is
11:19
crumbling so nothing is going to stay
11:22
and there's no way
11:23
this whole plan of what's going on
11:25
there's no way it could possibly remain
11:28
number one it's in the wrong season and
11:31
you can't pick a season and push it
11:33
ahead of god's plans you can't do that
11:36
and the devil still has not learned
11:38
that's why he keeps failing in this
11:41
whole thing i would like to say is going
11:43
to fail miserably on behalf of the
11:46
wicked and so the father said that to me
11:48
the other day he's about to be hit so
11:51
hard it's going to be a long time before
11:52
he recovers or could even try to push
11:55
his agenda for the socialism and
11:58
communism because nobody is going to
12:00
want after having gone through this this
12:02
stuff so i can say
12:04
one report that's a god report not my
12:07
own the enemy's about to take the
12:09
biggest hit he's ever seen so anybody
12:10
running around participating with all
12:12
this stuff you better get back in on the
12:14
path you're supposed to be on
12:16
i want to ask you a question about that
12:18
because
12:19
we know that there's people have
12:20
different faiths of when they think
12:22
things are going to wrap up you know
12:23
pre-trib midterm post trip and you and i
12:25
don't worry about that much mainly
12:27
because i'm listening to you and you
12:28
said god has taken you into the future a
12:29
hundred years yes and the the the
12:31
perilous times had not even come yet so
12:33
here's my this is a question it's not on
12:35
my list but i have relatives a lot of
12:38
them
12:39
uh and different
12:40
faiths i mean they're christians but
12:42
they're different brands that what i
12:44
would say but
12:45
so most of them are convinced that
12:47
things are wrapping up because it's so
12:49
evil it's so bad some of them have guns
12:51
some of them don't but they just say
12:53
this is it so
12:55
when you're describing that the devil's
12:58
about to take a hit that like he's never
13:00
taken before maybe since the time of the
13:02
cross
13:03
is it going to be so obvious that god
13:06
brought justice on the earth that even
13:09
those who are ready to see this wrap up
13:12
will say oh will they just get it will
13:14
they say oh i see this is not
13:17
that time well
13:19
i don't see how they could not get it
13:21
steve it'll be so drastically different
13:24
that it'll be this is how drastically
13:26
different it will be
13:27
people will be seeking out christians to
13:29
have them as friends
13:31
wow wow they will be bashing them
13:33
falsely judging them uh they won't be
13:36
pushing you know uh false religions or
13:39
witchcraft witchcraft is also about to
13:41
take a big hit right along with satan
13:43
and uh and that's not going to be heard
13:45
of for quite a while as you know very
13:48
last days that will change but we're not
13:50
there people if you just read the bible
13:53
and figure out
13:54
either god or jesus said the very things
13:57
that have not happened yet he's not
13:59
willing to change his mind because a
14:01
little devil thinks he can take over
14:03
and i can tell you that's what he is we
14:05
give him too much power and even thought
14:08
because the devil wants you to talk
14:09
about him and how bad it is rather than
14:11
the power and the glory of god which is
14:13
about to just blind the enemy and
14:15
wickedness around this world
14:17
the glory has not come from us yet okay
14:20
the baptism in fire has not happened i
14:24
trust me you won't have to say did i get
14:27
it
14:30
it's like a blow torch hitting you and
14:32
wipes all the fear of the enemy any
14:35
doubt you ever had filled you with
14:37
boldness
14:38
and you won't be the same that has not
14:40
happened okay the glory of the lord has
14:43
not covered this earth like the waters
14:44
cover the sea you don't know what the
14:46
glory is so you don't understand not
14:48
only do we create it for him and we give
14:50
it back he lets us carry it and impart
14:53
it like shockwaves into this world that
14:56
has not happened okay and this is the
14:58
number one thing the bible says the
15:00
world will know us the body of christ by
15:03
our love for each other
15:06
very clearly that is not happening right
15:08
now so god said i am not willing to
15:11
ditch my plan so maybe
15:14
man in their own understanding of what
15:16
they have assumed or even researched or
15:19
thought they had the dates
15:21
no one knows but the father he says i am
15:24
not done with anything yet
15:27
well now you know that the scripture you
15:28
just quoted i had not heard it um
15:32
interpreted the way you did because i
15:33
think i was taught or assumed that
15:36
what god was saying is the glory of the
15:38
lord covers the earth as the waters come
15:40
with the sea i thought okay so god's
15:41
saying
15:42
if we were in tune with him if we really
15:44
opened our eyes we would see right now
15:46
the glory of the god covering the face
15:48
of the earth as water cover the sea
15:50
that's not what you're saying is it no
15:52
that's not revelation that's what's
15:54
written that's not what that means and
15:56
if people even thought or considered
15:59
the great things that have been said by
16:02
father son or holy spirit themselves are
16:04
the things that will assure you will
16:06
happen
16:07
and i can tell you why it has not
16:09
happened the glory is evident it's light
16:12
coming from you are you looking at each
16:15
other with light blinding out of you
16:17
that the enemy is terrified of are you
16:20
imparting it in shock waves uh that will
16:23
will change things will change cities
16:25
will change places you go to
16:27
nothing can stand before the glory and
16:30
win
16:31
and that is an event those are events
16:33
these are events that god calls moves of
16:36
god that will bring a habitation of
16:38
heaven to the earth so we're not even
16:40
talking about one or two things
16:41
happening these things have not happened
16:43
but you can understand why god i'm sorry
16:45
i'm talking fast i'm excited
16:51
when you have seen it
16:53
it's different than thinking about it or
16:55
reading words and you go well that
16:56
sounds exciting no people
16:59
it's what you will be doing you are a
17:02
part of this why because christ in you
17:06
is the hope of glory that glory the
17:10
light and the power of god is what the
17:12
glory is it blinds the enemy it makes
17:15
you so bold you can't even hardly hold
17:17
still that everybody will run you to say
17:19
why are you filled with light what is
17:21
this all about why do i feel like god's
17:23
presence is here is that happening
17:27
i'm not talking about two or three
17:29
people these are waves moves of god now
17:32
the baptism and fire literally there's a
17:35
difference in baptism and fire and
17:37
carrying the glory yeah it'll cover the
17:40
earth because we'll take it there okay
17:42
the reason why like the waters come to
17:44
see is there's two thirds water one
17:47
third earth that's showing you this will
17:49
not be a little small thing that will be
17:51
happening
17:53
on the years and actually our 2021
17:55
calendar was all about the moods of god
17:58
coming on the earth i think we still
18:00
have some lust left i think we're
18:01
selling them
18:02
at a discount but you might check and
18:04
find it out but literally that calendar
18:06
was about the moves of god coming it
18:08
clearly explains baptism and fire even
18:11
what it looks like what happens when
18:13
you're baptizing fire it talks about the
18:15
move of god called the glory covering
18:17
the earth we get to carry it and people
18:20
go we can't do that then why is christ
18:22
in you the hope of glory why would he
18:24
say that yeah
18:26
why would he say that the fire of god
18:28
literally is like blue fire that sits on
18:32
you that burns in you and the more you
18:34
release it and use it for him the
18:37
greater it gets just like the anointing
18:39
that you carry in first john 2 27
18:41
there's a scripture for all you people
18:43
that think i don't know the bible by the
18:45
way i was reading this morning
18:48
first john 2 27 is your first weapon
18:51
he ever gave you is called the anointing
18:54
that doesn't just break the yoke but
18:56
destroys the yoke
18:58
the yoke of darkness it destroys it you
19:01
have it jesus put it in you and you got
19:03
born again and the more you give it out
19:06
the more you get this why it's called a
19:07
deposit to you create a cloud of the
19:09
anointing and when you walk past people
19:11
they'll be healed just like peter that's
19:13
what happened to peter
19:15
that is going to be such a major thing
19:17
and god would tell me they're sitting
19:19
there on the pews not knowing the power
19:22
they have in them even though it's in
19:24
the word
19:25
and and it talks about the it talks
19:27
about the anointing all through the
19:29
bible it was in jesus garment and they
19:31
said well he was the son of god yes but
19:33
we can carry he gave us a deposit of
19:36
that anointing and it lives it says it
19:38
abides in you and you know what's good
19:40
about the anointing it doesn't wear off
19:42
and it won't wash off you can put it on
19:44
every
19:45
endeavor send every text you send i
19:46
thought i'm gonna have my phone here and
19:48
put the anointing in it and it breaks
19:51
and destroys the yoke of darkness so
19:53
i'm telling you a little bit about
19:54
spirit force right now
19:56
anyway
19:57
but these are things that will happen on
19:59
the earth and they have not happened
20:01
anything because some little weenie
20:04
person who thinks they are our president
20:06
this stole it all thinks he spells it
20:08
all stealers and liars are friars i'm
20:12
telling you what right now in hell
20:14
if i ever heard lies coming out of
20:16
somebody's mouth it's been one after
20:18
another liars are friars sorry people
20:20
that's what the bible says
20:22
and so
20:23
but god is not ending it all with his
20:26
son this is what his own words are i
20:28
will not end it all with my son having a
20:30
weak pathetic testimony of the blood he
20:33
shed on calvary that gives us power over
20:36
all the power of the enemy i'm not doing
20:38
it
20:39
so good
20:40
and and
20:41
um cat should people be because you know
20:45
ruth hepflin taught about the glory i
20:47
did i've not read her books but i've
20:49
heard that you know she'd praise and
20:51
and
20:52
this and that until the glory comes and
20:53
i've heard my friend david um oh i can
20:56
never think of his last name uh but he's
20:58
he he says people get healed so easily
21:01
in the glory and i guess he's one of
21:02
those
21:03
you know david herzog thank you julie uh
21:06
and he he always welcomes the glory of
21:08
god and apparently he feels it and sees
21:11
it um he's probably more of a seer like
21:13
you are and i i i'm not quite that much
21:16
but
21:17
um
21:19
are people supposed to be seeking the
21:21
glory or just waiting for god to
21:24
bring it when it's time what's your
21:26
thoughts the thing you should seek is
21:28
baptism and fire that's actually
21:29
something you can seek the glory is
21:32
something that's created by your own
21:33
life
21:35
christ in you is the hope of glory the
21:38
hope that you will create glory for him
21:40
by the choices you make the words you
21:42
take authority in that creates glory for
21:45
him
21:46
okay but you know i know i used to say i
21:49
give it all back to you i would give it
21:50
all back to me said yes but you have to
21:52
carry it
21:53
and you will begin i'll look at people i
21:55
would see more light coming out of some
21:57
than others and i thought well that's
21:58
because they're saved but what i was
22:00
seeing was the glory that had
22:02
accumulated in their life
22:04
and there will come a time when we
22:06
literally began to release it it
22:08
happened to me one time i wasn't even
22:10
ready for it and i didn't ask for it but
22:12
i was talking about it and let me tell
22:15
you how you get to do these things you
22:16
have to talk about them
22:19
like you actually believe it is real
22:22
baptism and fire is something that will
22:24
happen and it will happen randomly then
22:27
it's going to happen in mass
22:29
and let me tell you what he's not going
22:30
to take that away either the the fire is
22:34
like in the book of acts and made the
22:35
people bold they were hiding before they
22:38
didn't want to be seen or known and yet
22:40
when the fire came on them along with
22:42
the baptism the holy spirit
22:44
when the fire came on them you literally
22:46
they saw it on their heads so they did
22:49
see it it's a spiritual fire and it
22:52
comes from the heart of the father
22:54
that's where it's sent from is sent from
22:55
his very being
22:56
and there's angels some of the angels
22:58
will be
22:59
be a part of carrying the fire down and
23:02
it will come down and it will come upon
23:04
us
23:04
the glory is different
23:07
i understand about creating an
23:09
atmosphere of glory i understand what
23:11
david's talking about and even roots i
23:13
understand that but this thing that's
23:15
talking about in the bible that the
23:17
knowledge and understanding and knowing
23:19
of so you got to understand what does
23:21
that word understand mean that means you
23:23
will know what it is uh the
23:25
understanding and knowing
23:27
of the glory of god is going to come
23:30
over this earth and it will come from us
23:34
and it will cover this earth like the
23:37
waters come to see two thirds of the
23:39
earth i believe that's what he's saying
23:41
well people will have uh created so much
23:44
glory for him you'll be able to see the
23:46
light in them you'll be able to see the
23:48
light in them the fire comes on you like
23:50
flames of fire on your head uh sometimes
23:53
i see fire coming out of people's hands
23:55
uh um i have had a measure
23:59
of baptism and fire a very small measure
24:02
you only think you've had a small
24:04
measure cat really i would have think
24:06
yeah you know measures of things
24:07
sometimes just so i can experience it
24:09
and i can tell people this thing is real
24:11
and you're not going to run around
24:12
saying did i get baptized in fire
24:16
you'll know nothing happened to me and i
24:19
had been seeking baptism and fire
24:21
because i a friend of mine had got
24:23
baptism in fire and uh and he had been
24:26
seeking god about he came and told me he
24:28
walked in the door and what is different
24:29
about you
24:31
why why do you have fire around you what
24:32
is that fire and i could even feel like
24:34
the heat of god uh coming from him and
24:37
he couldn't stop grinning goes i i gotta
24:40
measure the baptism in fire and i said
24:41
i'm going for it
24:45
i wanted to um be able to demonstrate
24:47
that for god
24:49
and i went down front they were having a
24:51
service in our church and i don't
24:53
normally go down front unless i'm told
24:54
by god to go down front
24:56
and so they called for people this is a
24:58
church of 4 000 members back in the day
25:01
anyone who thinks they're in the
25:02
ministry or our leaders
25:05
you tell this is some time ago
25:08
come forward i'm thinking that's not me
25:12
this is before the whole having things
25:13
started this is before the heaven thing
25:15
started that that was in 1989 when the
25:17
heaven thing started so this was before
25:19
that time and i have been adamantly
25:22
saying it's in the word my my friend
25:25
cliff got pat in the fire you know
25:27
respective persons you know i'm desiring
25:29
i really desired it more than eating or
25:31
sleep i wanted it really and so but on
25:34
this day it's still about obedience
25:36
he said to come down and come forward to
25:38
have hands laid on you to release you
25:41
into you know ministry or or leadership
25:44
or whatever well i knew that i was never
25:46
gonna be a pastor i knew he'd never call
25:48
me to be a pastor
25:49
and uh and i didn't go down
25:52
and boy the holy spirit started
25:54
bombarding me get down there get down
25:56
there you get down there and i'm like
25:58
and i wasn't arguing with him but i was
25:59
making statements like
26:02
i'm not a leader he said yes you are and
26:04
she said i'm not in the ministry he said
26:05
that doesn't matter you are going to be
26:07
a leader or a major leader get down
26:09
there right now he's going to make sure
26:10
he didn't miss it because he's my best
26:12
friend
26:13
so i walked down there you know just
26:14
walked down and the whole line he kind
26:16
of dissipated and i walked down front
26:19
and uh pastor zink i know he will never
26:23
forget this day neither will i he walked
26:25
up now he was the carrier of the fire he
26:28
laid his hand on me and the fire
26:32
of god came out of his hand it hit me so
26:35
hard i knocked i was sown against the
26:37
usher and we were throwing three rows
26:39
back into the company really cat wow
26:42
it was so powerful it felt like a
26:45
blowtorch coming in it burned everything
26:47
off the walls of my heart
26:49
it talks about in the bible that he
26:50
he'll uh make white the walls of your of
26:54
your heart it burnt everything out i
26:56
mean i wouldn't have sinned in here but
26:57
whatever was in there was burnt out and
26:59
i was so on fire i fell then i fell in
27:03
the aisle and i lay there
27:06
for nine and a half hours they locked
27:08
your hands
27:10
my body began to shake and two angels
27:13
came and caught me up uh in the spirit
27:16
and took me back in time it was like i
27:18
was flying through time
27:20
still filled with this fire it was so
27:22
burning me and when we stopped
27:25
when we stopped my feet hit the ground i
27:27
was outside the tomb of christ and he
27:28
had come out of the tomb and was in the
27:30
garden really
27:39
i was there at the time this was
27:41
happening because you know god time
27:43
comes from him people it comes from him
27:46
i'm not the only one who's had
27:47
encounters there but because i was
27:49
willing you see that i was hungry i
27:52
sought what i wanted and then when the
27:54
time came if i had not gone down i
27:56
believe i would have not ever gotten it
27:58
uh but because i obeyed and no one
28:00
forgets the day that that happened and
28:03
somebody when the service was over and
28:05
the pastor is so smart he would not let
28:07
them touch me
28:08
because my body vibrated the whole time
28:10
there were two angels that stayed with
28:12
my body now my spirit man wasn't there
28:15
and they go how can you be be alive well
28:17
if probably a layer of me he took i
28:19
don't want to explain that right now
28:21
okay took a layer of myself yeah that's
28:23
still you people you've got layers of
28:24
yourself inside of you
28:26
there's just too much to share in a
28:28
meeting anyway
28:30
so i my body was laying there but
28:32
literally just like this show like in
28:33
star wars how all those lights come
28:35
toward you i knew i was flying i did not
28:39
know it was going through time
28:41
and it was so rapidly all i could see
28:43
were lights and literally i felt my feet
28:46
touch the ground
28:47
uh and when that when when that vision
28:50
cleared the light was gone
28:52
i knew where i was i had never been a
28:54
new throat but i knew that that was the
28:56
tomb the stone had been rolled away
28:58
um
28:59
the two angels were there and i think
29:02
mary had gone inside because i saw this
29:05
whole scene mary went in had been in one
29:07
side and um
29:09
and then she comes out i watched it i
29:11
just watched the whole thing
29:13
and i saw jesus with his back turned in
29:16
the flowers he was smelling the flowers
29:19
people
29:20
he loves flowers he was in the garden
29:22
right outside the tomb that's why i know
29:24
that's the right one i saw it before and
29:27
then mary comes out and she goes can you
29:29
tell me where they have taken him she
29:31
thought he was the gardener right he was
29:33
in the flower bed he wasn't on the path
29:35
he literally stepped in the flower bed
29:37
uh right there by the tomb and was
29:39
smelling the flowers the minute he
29:42
turned
29:43
and he said something she knew it was
29:46
him
29:47
and so that's why i give i can give
29:49
revelation and clarity on that whole
29:51
thing that happened that then
29:54
me see when he was down letting me see
29:56
those same joint just took me
29:58
caught me up and brought me back excuse
30:00
me brought me back through time
30:02
literally traveled the time
30:05
and uh and then when we stopped uh when
30:07
they stopped
30:09
my body
30:10
my body sat up i was in the church there
30:13
was a security card i saw him sitting
30:15
over there i looked there was a note
30:16
stuffed in my sleeve and i pulled out
30:18
and my daughter said when she wakes up
30:20
call my dad here's the number
30:21
[Laughter]
30:24
wow and and for two weeks i couldn't
30:27
speak english
30:29
really
30:30
i could not speak english i only could
30:31
speak in tongues when i tried to open my
30:33
mouth and uh and in those two weeks
30:36
after that
30:37
he kept showing me things like he kept
30:40
showing me um like the not the perils
30:43
times but the glory days that are going
30:45
to be on the earth uh he
30:47
started back way back then showing me
30:49
things he showed me things that will
30:51
happen like um
30:53
one judgment begins to come to the body
30:56
and the leadership i i saw i had a
30:59
vision
31:00
i had a vision and uh i was taken
31:03
forward in time i don't know how far in
31:05
time but i saw the fire begin to fall on
31:08
people first then it's going to fall on
31:10
buildings and places and that fire will
31:13
begin to expose or empower people in
31:16
mass
31:17
i saw
31:18
pastors who had taught well and taught
31:21
what was truth i saw them everyone was
31:24
thrown to the floor in this church
31:26
everybody even the pastor and he was
31:28
trying to speak in the microphone as he
31:31
was laying down he couldn't move because
31:32
the glory uh the glory and the fire was
31:35
so heavy on him and then he'd take me to
31:37
another place and show me other places
31:39
and he took me to this one place where
31:41
this pastor had been deceiving people
31:44
i'm not
31:46
i didn't know this person but this this
31:48
was something that will actually happen
31:50
i saw
31:51
he doesn't show me maybe things he
31:53
doesn't show me things that represent
31:55
something he shows me the literal thing
31:57
i saw this pastor who had been lying and
32:00
cheating and doing all kinds of unclean
32:02
things and thought he was okay that
32:05
pastor dropped dead
32:08
and people crawled because they couldn't
32:10
this is at the same time this happened
32:12
they crawled forward and dragged him off
32:15
the off the platform and dragged him out
32:17
because they couldn't stand up and i
32:19
heard the voice of god said i will
32:21
appoint him
32:22
and everybody knew who that him was
32:26
that him crawled up to the platform god
32:28
said this is your pastor and i'm saying
32:30
if you think god's not going to divinely
32:32
do things you better think twice he is
32:35
still god he has a plan for this earth
32:38
and these these days i was seeing was
32:41
glory it was glory days baptism and fire
32:43
days so it will be different in those
32:45
days like in ice and sapphira i do
32:48
believe that it will be an instantaneous
32:51
thing that will happen
32:52
people have been lying and telling
32:54
people lies saying they represent god
32:57
they will not get away with it in those
32:59
days coming so we're not done we're not
33:02
anywhere near done uh and like i said
33:04
i've been taking over 100 years into the
33:06
future he's also taken me into the past
33:08
like at the tomb uh when he made the
33:12
earth i got to see that so nobody can
33:15
tell me this is not real i'm i'm not
33:17
going to believe it because i've seen
33:19
the living god i've seen his son
33:21
holy spirit i've seen his image and uh
33:24
he chose me i didn't choose myself to
33:26
reveal heaven he did
33:28
and um
33:30
so let me tell you there's a lot of
33:31
accountability in him and i i'm very
33:34
careful about every word i say
33:37
that if it's him i'll say it i can't do
33:40
panels i can't discuss what other people
33:42
think or say god didn't tell me those
33:45
things so i don't invite me to be part
33:46
of a panel i can only say what god said
33:49
to me and tell you what he showed me
33:52
yeah i've seen that i'm going to ask you
33:54
a question you may not know the answer
33:56
this but whatever pastor that was is
33:57
suddenly dropped dead do you happen to
33:59
know was he lost did he go home early
34:02
what do you or do you have any idea
34:04
was he
34:06
i do know that sometimes god will take
34:08
somebody before he'll let them go to
34:10
hell
34:11
um
34:12
okay and if they weren't living right
34:14
and they dropped dead they probably had
34:16
that moment of when they died that
34:18
probably faced christ okay uh
34:20
for for to see if he is going to hell or
34:24
not okay okay
34:26
that's good so i didn't know that part i
34:27
only know that he was showing me that
34:30
when he says he will judge the church
34:32
first he meant it yeah and i know people
34:34
say well judgment is here no this stuff
34:36
is happening isn't judgment against us
34:38
it's judgment against the evil the ones
34:42
being judged now is the evil so that the
34:44
glory and the power of god and those who
34:47
god has picked or anybody who chooses to
34:50
can freely move around and not be kind
34:53
you know not arrested or made fun of or
34:56
made points up no people will be running
34:59
in these days when this whole thing
35:01
happens he's about to do people's minds
35:04
and hearts will be drawn to god to know
35:06
him to know christ
35:08
and we're entering into a whole new way
35:10
of living on this earth and people think
35:13
it's all over well if you want to die
35:14
and go to heaven you go right ahead
35:17
i'm not going anywhere and you don't let
35:18
me go because i'm not going to miss what
35:20
god is going to do in this world for the
35:22
next several hundred years wow
35:25
i love that well you know let me get
35:26
into this first question which
35:27
coincidentally
35:29
we know there's no coincidences right
35:32
but this person it's actually an
35:34
extension of what you've been saying
35:36
this says will cat walk through or kind
35:38
of describe a typical day what does she
35:40
see in the spirit realm does it look
35:41
like what does it look like when she
35:43
prays when she's at the grocery store
35:45
driving down the road does she see
35:47
demons attached to people do angels and
35:49
demons walk through the grocery store
35:51
just looking at each other so she's kind
35:52
of wanting it's kind of extension of
35:54
what you're describing katna you've got
35:56
the seer anointing gift
35:58
so do you walk around seeing angels and
36:00
demons all day long or is that
36:03
do you just have to almost ignore them
36:05
or do you pay attention to everything
36:06
you're seeing
36:07
i observe um i was the quiet child out
36:11
of 15
36:12
and um my mom will validate that i'm
36:15
glad that my mom's still alive one day
36:16
we're going to do a whole show with her
36:18
it'll be quite interesting and
36:21
well whatever uh yes i do
36:23
all the time i see them all the time
36:26
and i that's how i know how hell
36:28
operates i mean
36:30
and people fall under the trap so easily
36:32
thinking no one will ever know i did
36:35
these things you're very wrong if you're
36:37
living a sinful life and you say you're
36:39
a believer you're very wrong that no
36:40
one's seeing you the darkness sees you
36:43
the the the angelic sees you god from
36:45
heaven can see you
36:47
and let me tell you he does write things
36:49
down he's not forgetful he just likes to
36:52
record things he likes to do that
36:55
i do the same thing whenever he says
36:58
something to me i have journals and
36:59
journals and journals of scenes i have
37:02
seen
37:03
words he spoke words that were spoken
37:05
about things
37:07
i i have much of that written down but i
37:09
was the quiet one so i learned early to
37:12
observe and not say anything i mean a
37:15
lot of my family didn't know a lot of
37:17
this was going on at all i was just
37:18
really quiet didn't have much to say to
37:20
anybody when you're part of a tribe you
37:21
don't need to run out and find friends
37:23
so i didn't really have friends yeah
37:26
and besides i knew the ones that who
37:27
weren't doing good things so i just
37:29
avoided avoiding them
37:32
wow well that's fascinating so you i
37:35
mean so
37:36
you know
37:38
i remember i'm even going back years not
37:40
just recently where i'm aware but i'm
37:42
saying years
37:43
i would be maybe close to doing
37:46
something that would be a sin a known
37:48
sin whatever and i would say to myself i
37:51
know about three seers
37:53
and they're gonna see if i do this and
37:56
if i
37:56
did this and i thought there's gonna be
37:58
at least three people that know is that
38:00
about right are there seers that just
38:02
simply no god's going to reveal it to
38:04
two or three well they can see because
38:07
they know what's around you
38:08
and it doesn't always have to be demons
38:11
or angels you can have certain clouds on
38:14
you you can have different light or less
38:17
light coming out of you
38:19
as a seer you would if you know how life
38:22
operates itself you know what a believer
38:24
looks like when they just got born again
38:26
there's so much light coming out of them
38:28
or sometimes you can see something and
38:30
it depends on how much god
38:33
does give measures and all of that he
38:35
gives measures some people can see
38:37
certain things at certain times
38:39
sometimes if he really wants them to see
38:41
something he will but other times he
38:42
won't let them see them
38:44
it's something that you grow into or he
38:46
just throws it on you well when i
38:48
arrived when i arrived i could see when
38:50
i arrived even as a baby i could see
38:52
things growing up as a little child i
38:54
could see things
38:55
and i knew no one else could see them
38:57
because they never talked about them so
38:59
i just kept it inside you know how in
39:00
the bible some people said they just
39:02
kept it to themselves
39:04
like mary would consider something and
39:05
it said that she kept it to herself she
39:07
didn't necessarily share it
39:08
um but but i can take you all the way
39:10
back from when i was really young the
39:12
things that i saw operating on the earth
39:14
but the devil has an mo he has mode of
39:16
operations
39:18
and um and he cannot know or see
39:20
everything all at the same time he is
39:22
not god although he'd like to be that's
39:24
why he has to have so many of his demons
39:26
are like scouts and they mark people or
39:29
if they if he knows someone's heavily
39:31
anointed the enemy will pursue them to
39:33
get them caught into crime put in prison
39:36
so they can't do anything against him a
39:38
lot of people in prison actually have
39:40
high calls on their life i've spoken
39:42
several times in prison and
39:44
they didn't stay the same when i was
39:45
there
39:46
because i told them what was going on
39:48
with them and i told them how satan had
39:50
used them and uh
39:52
anyway
39:53
yeah i can see everything like even in
39:55
disney world i'm not talking against
39:57
disney world itself by the way uh walt
40:00
disney did make it to heaven people no
40:02
matter what you thought about him he's
40:03
there and mickey mouse mickey mouse made
40:05
it to heaven now he's not in charge of
40:07
what happens in that whole place right
40:09
now i know some things he's not happy
40:10
about that's going on he's just not
40:12
happy about it but the purpose he
40:14
designed it and god gave him the ideas
40:17
so that families and people could go
40:19
somewhere to have fun
40:21
they have fun in heaven and he gave him
40:23
that whole thing
40:24
but um so i'll i was there one time but
40:26
the people who come there from all over
40:28
the world some were just they worship
40:30
false gods and they can't hide that from
40:32
me because i see what's with them nobody
40:34
in the line like i could stand on the
40:36
line look at everybody and see who they
40:37
have with them to see the expressions on
40:39
their angels faces just get out of the
40:41
way sometimes really
40:44
so you see both their angels and the
40:46
demonic that are both there by each
40:48
person yes oh yes i do and sometimes if
40:51
the person is not doing something right
40:53
the demons will mock their angels
40:56
really i'll walk them because they
40:58
caught they got them to go into
40:59
something they shouldn't have um so
41:02
that's another whole thing that's not i
41:03
mean hey you have you ever seen yeah and
41:06
then probably more jen spends a lot of
41:08
time with me during the daytime and my
41:10
husband i share a lot with him but my
41:11
husband is also definitely a quiet
41:13
person um he has seen several angels
41:17
he's seen them when they come to me so
41:18
he knows it's all real but he's scottish
41:20
and
41:21
you know you're not moved a whole lot
41:22
you don't have a whole lot of things
41:24
like you and god gave me my husband on
41:27
purpose because he's like this rock okay
41:29
he's not just moved by things and
41:32
and he gave me him and i know i have no
41:34
way out of that because he said i'm
41:35
giving you somebody and i chose him for
41:37
you before you were born wow wow but jen
41:40
knows a lot and jen has learned and
41:42
learned to discern a lot of things
41:44
herself because she does spend a lot of
41:45
time with me like during the day and
41:47
stuff and she'll start taking authority
41:49
before we even go and let me tell you i
41:51
can tell you this demons are in a lot of
41:52
places uh doing different things they're
41:55
also recording things or they're
41:57
speaking into people's ears a lot
41:59
a lot of the negative things you hear
42:01
aren't really coming from you is things
42:02
they're saying and if you hear words
42:05
that like like i hate that person you
42:06
should tell the devil just to shut up
42:08
and go away because you're not going to
42:09
believe them okay
42:10
stop them it says take every thought
42:12
captive and most people don't so they
42:14
end up a mess
42:15
you don't need to take any negative
42:17
thoughts in your head they don't have no
42:18
right to put it there but they'll
42:19
they'll do what they can get away with
42:21
let me ask you a question there's you
42:23
said you saw the the demons mocking
42:25
their angels have you ever seen the
42:27
angels smack one of them down to the oh
42:29
yeah
42:30
okay so i'd like to hear more tell us
42:32
more about that you know
42:34
i will let the smackdown especially if
42:36
it's a moment of decision in the purples
42:39
people's in the people's life
42:41
if they're having to make a decision a
42:42
major decision about am i going to go
42:44
with that group am i going to go do that
42:46
stuff or am i do i really want to be a
42:48
part of this thing that i know is wrong
42:51
and they'll go back and forth and
42:52
they'll they're they're alone the person
42:54
is probably alone and they're talking
42:55
about out loud
42:58
now i say this enemy can hear what
42:59
you're saying people so you know say
43:01
powerful things and say things of light
43:03
and if you're up for some and say i
43:04
forgive them that the demons hate the
43:06
word i forgive
43:08
they don't want you to forgive people
43:09
they want you to be offended
43:11
and stop from hearing god but i can tell
43:14
this one scene i did see
43:16
was there were several angels and then
43:18
this one demon who'd been assigned to
43:20
pull him off of his track because he's
43:22
going to be somebody great for god and
43:24
they kept talking to him so he'd start
43:25
going in this other direction
43:27
and i would see the angels go no don't
43:29
go there no you know you needed not and
43:30
then they would
43:32
they would start praying over the person
43:34
their self like you know i'm declaring
43:35
they're not going to go there father you
43:37
can understand uh we're here what what
43:40
should we say to him
43:41
this person who's being drawn in the
43:42
other direction and then all of a sudden
43:44
the person stand there after the angels
43:47
had said things now they're not seeing
43:48
these they're not seeing the angels and
43:50
demons but they're hearing in their mind
43:52
what was said and they think that's
43:55
their self making that that saying that
43:58
thing and that so the demon is saying
44:00
hey no one's going to go no one's going
44:02
to know come on just go this night you
44:04
know nobody's going to care you know
44:05
it's not really sin come on you're going
44:07
to really it's like something never you
44:09
want to see all that stuff you want to
44:11
and then the demon would start walking
44:12
in the direction of this place they were
44:14
outside this place
44:16
and then the angel would say oh no you
44:18
belong to god you know
44:20
you love god you you were born for a
44:22
purpose for him then he turned around
44:23
and go upstairs so you literally could
44:25
see
44:26
that he was hearing them i could hear
44:28
them
44:29
and uh and then he would be pulled and
44:30
walking the other directions and then
44:32
then the angels will go over there and
44:33
smack the demon and today you might as
44:36
well get out of here he's not going to
44:37
go your way you're not going to you're
44:38
not going to get him you're not getting
44:39
him
44:40
and eventually this person did decide to
44:42
just go the right way and left all of it
44:45
and the demon was angry
44:47
he was angry he was screaming and and
44:49
then one of the angels went over there
44:50
and just shoved him down and said you
44:52
need to leave now or it's going to get
44:54
worse for you and that demon ran off i'm
44:56
sure he didn't go make a report
44:58
because if he goes back and reports he
45:00
wasn't successful he gets punished
45:02
the angels get rewarded by god they get
45:04
rewarded by god for encouraging and
45:07
inspiring uh
45:09
these people so this person never went
45:11
into the darkness at all and ended up by
45:13
being somebody great for god so it
45:16
happens it does happen that's good you
45:18
know i'm going to just come up play off
45:20
this for a minute i know i have so many
45:22
questions but
45:23
you're talking about the the literal war
45:25
between angels and demons and the real
45:26
person and this is a real encounter and
45:29
you taught us to just you know take
45:31
power over all the power of the enemy
45:32
and then begin to pray and send your
45:35
hosts out decree these things and you
45:38
talk about bashing and trashing them and
45:40
tearing down the strongholds or the
45:41
highest places or the or the
45:44
what's the other word you use the
45:46
platform that they play for yeah so i
45:49
i've heard there was a
45:50
ministry uh a woman
45:53
um you might know the name but i've
45:55
heard her say
45:56
one time
45:57
i think she just told me it was similar
45:59
because you talked about bashing and
46:01
trashing
46:02
um the ending and she was decreeing
46:07
that these demons that wouldn't leave
46:08
such and such alone that they'd be put
46:10
to torture is that sort of the same
46:12
thing and can you do that can you can
46:15
you command the host to put those demons
46:18
to torture if they won't leave you alone
46:19
something like that is that i would
46:21
certainly think that you can say
46:23
anything to especially if it's the army
46:25
that you command yourself
46:27
uh they totally and this is what i have
46:30
found is there's something you give them
46:32
to tell them to do and they're not
46:33
allowed like if there's a boundary that
46:35
they can't go past like they can't kill
46:37
they can't kill people obviously
46:39
but uh
46:40
i actually say do bash mash and trash
46:44
trash means throw them in a dry place my
46:47
my home oh that means sew them in a dry
46:49
place they actually fight them they
46:52
actually fight them and uh and i tell
46:54
them to enjoy doing it because
46:57
uh this makes it different about i know
46:59
you want to say something what no no no
47:01
no no i'm just saying good good good
47:04
this sounds good that means when they're
47:05
bashed that means they literally will
47:07
hit them mash them means they're being
47:09
pushed back and trash them means put
47:11
them in a dry place so these are orders
47:14
i give a lot when i send the host to
47:15
specific places or about different
47:18
people
47:19
or those like in the white house i've
47:21
been sent a whole lot lately and there's
47:24
a lot of demons operating there because
47:26
they're given permission
47:28
not because the person has power
47:31
but because the people are wicked and
47:33
when they decree and make rulings that
47:35
are wicked
47:36
hell sends more demons around them
47:38
uh that they can go persecute wherever
47:40
the stuff is being given or sent out
47:43
and so i am continually this is one
47:45
thing i don't do once
47:47
if this is an ongoing battle and that's
47:49
what we're in then i don't stop sending
47:52
them and i can send them like i'll send
47:54
them a wave of let's say a half a
47:56
million
47:57
into dc
47:58
and they will be there for 10 days 24
48:01
hours a day releasing the terror of god
48:03
on the leaders of these who are helping
48:06
to compile and come up with these wicked
48:08
things
48:09
or come up with come up with ways to
48:11
punish people or steal from people and
48:14
that that wave i send will remain there
48:17
the days i tell them to and every hour
48:19
they will release or do battle and
48:22
however i have expressed for them to do
48:24
it now they have uh their they have
48:27
they're like platoons or groups or um if
48:29
i depends on how many i said i could
48:31
send 10 to a certain place or a half a
48:34
million or something like that or more
48:37
their commander that that i give
48:40
commands to they go with them and make
48:42
sure they carry all this out when
48:44
they're done in that 10 days they will
48:47
fill the sky
48:48
over my home and they are grinning they
48:51
are grinning from ear to ear because
48:54
they did exactly what they were sent for
48:56
and i will tell you people think it's
48:57
bad it would be a whole lot worse if
49:00
there weren't people taking authority
49:02
and not tolerating the acts of the enemy
49:05
instead of complaining or being afraid
49:06
do something about it you say something
49:09
we get to rule in this world your words
49:12
are powerful you shall have whatsoever
49:14
you say you know if you if you believe
49:16
in your heart you declare it then it
49:17
shall come to pass when you declare
49:19
degree thing it shall be established
49:21
unto you there's all these things and
49:23
things in the bible
49:25
uh and when we rule if you're ruling as
49:28
a king or a priest you have an army with
49:30
you
49:31
you have the right to send it where you
49:33
know things are happening like i've been
49:35
i sent them to afghanistan i just sent
49:37
them between russia and the ukraine i
49:40
sent like a half a billion
49:42
uh yeah to prevent that stuff from
49:45
happening to protect and surround the
49:46
people in ukraine and begin to speak to
49:49
the leader of russia i mean yeah i say
49:51
these things to them and they will do
49:53
those things if it's within the
49:55
boundaries that god set them and we all
49:57
know what i'm talking about hopefully
49:59
the watcher angels were sent and um god
50:02
put a boundary around them and said you
50:04
cannot go beyond the bounds i have set
50:06
for you and you cannot step into another
50:08
place that you don't have the right to
50:10
be
50:11
and of course we know some of those
50:12
watcher angels broke that that contract
50:15
god sent them from heaven watcher angels
50:17
have flesh on them people it's just a
50:19
tribe of angels god made so people could
50:21
see them they were to educate man they
50:23
were never to mix with them they weren't
50:25
supposed to make you know babies
50:27
obviously they weren't supposed to mix
50:28
with with the women on the earth and yet
50:31
satan got into them and talked to them
50:33
about oh no you god's uh telling you you
50:35
can't lead he knows you'll rule he even
50:38
lies to he lies to his on his own so
50:41
they stepped when the bounds they were
50:43
made and left their former estate their
50:46
former estate is the contract god gave
50:48
them of what they could do the
50:50
boundaries were to keep them from going
50:52
beyond that and yet these watcher angels
50:55
who were sent to the earth to educate
50:57
men
50:58
some of them broke every one of them
51:00
they lost the relationship with god and
51:03
they those those watcher angels that
51:04
created the nephilim those were the
51:06
offspring of the watcher angels so
51:09
here's an answer to you how did they
51:10
create offspring they had flesh on their
51:13
body so men can see them and learn and
51:16
learn what was right and help to educate
51:18
them those watcher angels are bound in
51:21
chains for future judgment just so you
51:24
understand that those water angels are
51:26
not on the earth uh the nephilim who
51:28
were the offspring
51:29
uh we could go into
51:32
another whole thing like that there are
51:33
not nephilim on the earth right now the
51:36
not the ones that were nephilim's that
51:38
were nephilim offspring they died
51:40
they're called disembodied spirits they
51:42
still operate with satan so there's more
51:44
than just demons there's principalities
51:46
powers i mean
51:48
as a seer you see all of this and you
51:51
can identify you know the difference
51:53
when you're seeing oh that that was a
51:54
watcher angel or that was a something
51:57
you know you you kind of can see
51:58
not every single watcher angel was bad
52:02
by the way not every one of them decided
52:05
to be evil i'm sure they had arguments
52:08
with the ones who did decide because i
52:10
know they had discussions in heaven back
52:12
when satan was trying to take over
52:13
lucifer was trying to take over and he
52:15
went to tempt all of the angels and got
52:18
one third to follow him that's mine
52:20
something isn't that's crazy to think
52:22
he's a created being and they chose to
52:24
believe a creed of being
52:26
than the creator and there was a lot of
52:28
discussions i was taken back and saw
52:30
that happening in heaven before lucifer
52:33
fell
52:34
okay now you're saying that the what the
52:36
nephilim which were the giants of the
52:38
day and they were they turned evil
52:40
that they died off but then they become
52:43
disembodied spirits just like someone
52:45
they they went to the dark side they
52:47
were evil so now they're just demons
52:50
who previously had done this nephilim
52:52
stuff and now they're just demons
52:55
they're spirits they're spirits they
52:58
don't have a body they have a spiritual
53:00
body okay they no longer have their
53:02
physical body but because they already
53:04
had given themselves to satan obviously
53:07
um
53:08
some of these angels
53:10
brought in um
53:12
sacrifice they they talk the dark arts
53:15
to people
53:16
that's where the black magic stuff comes
53:18
but magic's not good people i'm sorry no
53:20
i'm not sorry it's just not good okay
53:22
it's not um i don't even like to use the
53:25
word and i know people look at it as a
53:27
little fun kind of a thing but not from
53:28
where it came from so they they had done
53:31
already wicked things so when they died
53:33
their flesh died their disembodied
53:35
spirits are used by satan they they are
53:38
spiritual beings but they're also high
53:40
level um evil beings okay well let's see
53:44
let me ask you a couple more questions
53:46
here um
53:47
this april wants to know what is it what
53:49
can a person do i guess the emphasis
53:51
would be do
53:53
what can a person do to become a
53:54
manifested son or daughter of god that's
53:57
the question
53:58
and that's kind of open to anybody it's
54:01
something that you choose with your life
54:03
and the choices you make are very
54:05
important um
54:07
and they are different from other
54:09
believers they are believers a
54:11
manifested son or daughter of god is a
54:13
believer
54:14
who has willingly obeyed god that
54:16
doesn't mean they didn't make mistakes
54:17
but they came right back on the path he
54:19
had them on that you're willing and
54:21
obedient to what god is asking you in
54:24
your life in other words you can't play
54:26
in the darkness you can't decide to sin
54:28
one day and not now you can decide to do
54:30
that but you will not manifest for god
54:33
and you cannot say i'm a manifested son
54:36
or i'm a manifested daughter and yet you
54:38
have sin in your life and god won't
54:40
allow it because if that did happen and
54:43
people had that power and ability within
54:46
them to manifest the power of the living
54:48
god
54:50
and they were sinning then the world
54:52
would say why should i get saved
54:55
so in these days we're coming into there
54:57
is a line being drawn that if you want
54:59
god to really use you number one don't
55:01
even consider sinning don't even
55:03
consider sinning at all uh that's not
55:05
going to help you in your relationship
55:07
with god and i'm not saying people won't
55:09
make mistakes and not make it to heaven
55:12
and there's a difference in making
55:14
really serious mistakes and sinning
55:16
those are two different things
55:18
serious mistakes could be things that
55:20
alter your destiny take you off the path
55:23
um
55:24
maybe not fulfilling some things that
55:26
god had asked you to fulfill but you
55:28
choose in your own flesh to do something
55:30
else
55:31
those are these mistakes sin is sin
55:34
and if it's a sin you need to repent
55:36
from it and i do not believe this whole
55:38
thing going around was the blood covered
55:40
at once and for also sent all you want
55:41
to no that's not what that means no okay
55:44
because when you're unrighteous if you
55:46
sin you're unrighteous
55:51
you are righteous and there's a big
55:53
difference what is it if you're if
55:54
you're become a manifested sins of god
55:57
is there a moment of time when god says
55:59
now and he does that and what is a and
56:02
what is a manifested son or daughter of
56:03
god
56:04
because i've never heard a teaching on
56:06
that so what are they they're obviously
56:08
sinless because that's clear you just
56:09
said that but what do they have
56:12
what's the word higher gifts higher
56:13
anointings higher power what what how
56:16
would you describe someone with that
56:18
versus just a christian who doesn't have
56:20
that
56:22
oh when when and i and there are there's
56:25
also there's right now in this earth
56:27
manifested sons and daughters people who
56:29
are beginning to operate in the fullness
56:31
of that power
56:32
and it is about power god's trusting you
56:35
with more power it also is the measure
56:38
that you have been operating in things
56:40
will greatly increase okay uh like say
56:43
you god has given you a gift of
56:45
influence that influence will be favored
56:47
without measure
56:49
it it increases and i do understand all
56:52
that i don't want people to think they
56:54
cannot be because they're not smart
56:56
enough they don't have enough money
56:58
they're not known it doesn't matter
56:59
about any of those things it's your
57:01
heart
57:02
for jesus it's how much you love him and
57:05
you desire people to know about him that
57:07
doesn't mean you have to become a pastor
57:09
of a church the fifo minister still
57:11
operating in the earth that doesn't mean
57:13
you have to be one of those to be a
57:15
manifested son or daughter if you
57:17
receive jesus christ in your life and
57:19
you're a male that makes you that would
57:21
mean if you if you pursue to manifest
57:24
for god you tell him that number one if
57:26
you're a believer you love the word of
57:28
god and
57:29
you know you're not running off after
57:31
sin and you're not bashing people or
57:33
whatever you do not bash you cannot use
57:35
this mouth to crush people's hopes steal
57:39
their dreams away
57:40
make them feel worthless you are not
57:43
ever going to manifest for him because
57:44
the things you speak is how you operate
57:47
in measures of that power is what you
57:49
say
57:50
it says it will speak to the lay and the
57:52
sea in the air and they will obey
57:54
it clearly says that you'll say to a
57:56
mountain it'll jump into the sea and
57:58
jump back out that would be a manifested
58:00
son of god speaking to that for whatever
58:02
purpose that was those those things are
58:05
going to happen that's another reason
58:06
why the rapture isn't going to happen
58:08
right now god's training these
58:11
generations right now on the earth
58:14
to manifest and demonstrate who he is
58:19
and what he stands for and you begin to
58:23
live in a way that you desire to please
58:25
him more than anything else and you
58:27
actually say to god i want to be just
58:30
like you that's not saying you want to
58:31
be him right
58:33
this is hard if you will say i want to
58:35
be just like you i want to love like you
58:37
i want to help people like you you don't
58:40
want people to hear your voice when i
58:42
speak i said all those things to him
58:44
he'll begin to answer back
58:47
because he knows now that's remember
58:49
when he said david was a man after his
58:50
heart remember that oh yeah that's hard
58:53
now he did make mistakes but he always
58:55
got back in line where god had him he
58:58
would worship him and speak to him like
59:00
he really was real
59:02
and i say people can have conversations
59:04
in all kinds of ways but having a
59:06
conversation with god is really how all
59:09
of this begins to start he wants
59:11
he can see it's in your heart but he
59:13
wants you to say
59:15
what's in your heart and and and but the
59:18
manifested sons and daughters the earth
59:20
is in travail right now
59:22
not because it's the end time is crying
59:24
out for the manifested sons and
59:26
daughters to stand up and begin to
59:28
operate in the earth they are very
59:30
important to god and you might not
59:32
nobody know you at all that doesn't mean
59:34
you want to manifest and demonstrate
59:37
signs and wonders in the earth even some
59:39
never seen before those days haven't
59:42
happened yet no but we're right there on
59:45
the edge of that beginning and so you're
59:48
saying that a person should be saying
59:51
and i guess what you're saying use your
59:52
mouth to say to the lord i want to
59:55
become a manifested son or daughter of
59:57
god
59:58
are you saying it's not just you're
60:00
laying there and you're you're having a
60:01
quiet time with the lord and you're
60:03
saying in your heart i want to become a
60:05
a manifested son are you saying it
60:08
actually needs to be said or do you just
60:10
mean whether you use your mouth or your
60:12
heart you continue to i think you should
60:15
say it to him i can only go by my own
60:18
experience and um
60:20
that i literally would begin to say
60:21
things alone i mean
60:24
god people he make appointments for
60:26
everything else
60:27
tell god
60:28
jesus i want to meet you tonight at 10
60:30
10 p.m i'll be wherever
60:32
trust me he'll be there and if you can't
60:34
see him and then you talk like he is
60:35
there that's good
60:37
i haven't done everything i was supposed
60:38
to but i'm making a decision in my life
60:41
i'm running after you with everything i
60:42
have because the word says if i seek for
60:44
you with all of my heart
60:47
i will find you
60:49
i want to find you i want to know you i
60:51
want to operate for you i want to
60:53
demonstrate that you are alive and in
60:55
who you are in this earth
60:57
you will delight the heart of god but he
61:00
will also
61:01
make notice that you have now made a
61:04
declaration that he can then take and
61:07
begin to work with you
61:09
uh and especially make sure you've got
61:10
holy spirit if you haven't i would
61:12
encourage you to to um ask for the
61:15
impartation of speaking in tongues and
61:17
the holy spirit moving inside when you
61:19
get born again holy spirit is out here
61:22
walking with you but when you say holy
61:24
spirit i choose to invite you to indwell
61:26
me he literally goes from here to in
61:28
here and then that will help you share
61:30
clearly um and i even talked to the holy
61:33
spirit also thank you holy spirit for
61:35
guiding me
61:36
if there's anything i'm not aware of
61:37
make me aware of that is there something
61:39
i haven't done yet please let me know
61:41
that and you begin to hear
61:43
um it may be on the inside but you begin
61:45
to hear him also speak to you you have
61:47
to understand this is god's heart
61:50
for you to represent him in this earth
61:52
is enough representing the evil but
61:54
there is no demon bigger than the the ma
61:58
the massive angels i have seen and it's
62:01
their words and the fear they try to use
62:03
to manipulate you let me tell you what
62:05
there's one angel that could take a hold
62:07
of a demon or a principality and and
62:10
shred them and throw them like paper
62:12
across the sky so don't you ever think
62:15
that satan has the biggest ones
62:17
even if that matters thou greatest power
62:20
in this earth is the love of god and the
62:23
life of god and the blood that was shed
62:26
for you gives you the right to rule and
62:28
reign in dominion and authority over
62:31
darkness yeah well kat now i want to ask
62:34
you this is either malachi at three or
62:36
four and there's a saying you know they
62:38
some people began to complain and they
62:40
said what do we get for serving now we
62:42
are we have just the same problems as
62:44
everyone else very paraphrased you know
62:46
why are we different than anyone else
62:47
but it says those that feared the lord
62:50
talked about him that was the version
62:53
that i read those that fear the lord
62:54
talked about him and god said
62:56
they will be mine in the day when i make
62:58
up my treasured possession do you know
63:00
what that day is because you said
63:03
earlier in this broadcast that you need
63:05
to talk about him that god would take
63:07
note that i thought of that scripture
63:09
um
63:10
what does it mean they will be mine the
63:12
day i make it my treasured possession if
63:14
if you know that i i will say this first
63:17
my first comment i will make is the fear
63:19
of the lord
63:20
is not you being afraid of jesus christ
63:23
the fear of the lord is you being afraid
63:25
that you will do something to hurt him
63:28
okay that's the correct answer for the
63:30
fear of the lord that you love him so
63:32
much you don't want to do something that
63:33
would hurt him
63:35
so that's when he said when you speak of
63:37
the fear of the lord they're talking
63:38
about the love they have for the lord
63:41
and who he is that's what they these
63:43
people will talk about i i do that all
63:45
the time yeah um i'm supposed to bring
63:48
hope
63:48
and um but i'm not afraid there's
63:51
nothing in me that's afraid father son
63:53
of a husband but i don't ever want
63:55
anything
63:56
you know that would hurt them or make
63:57
them uh disappointed yeah and i guess i
63:59
had assumed it was meant it meant the
64:02
reverential aw or something like that
64:04
right those who feared the lord in other
64:05
words they honored and respected
64:07
something like that
64:09
okay yeah there is going to be a time uh
64:12
there's days coming on the earth one
64:14
when there will be a seal i'm not
64:17
talking about the the the thousands that
64:19
would be sealed in the end times i'm not
64:21
talking about that uh pray that my
64:23
people be willing in the day of my power
64:25
that is tied to that
64:27
jesus said pray my people be willing in
64:29
the day of my power
64:31
and that is the power of the living god
64:33
being seen on this earth in in mass in
64:36
many places the signs and wonders and
64:38
things like that doing those who are out
64:40
there already speaking about who he is
64:43
and what he means to them yeah god is
64:46
going to go and choose those teeth those
64:48
people to begin to demonstrate like stop
64:52
an earthquake and make it put it back
64:53
the way it was before it came
64:55
that would be a demonstration wow he's
64:57
going to choose those who are already
64:59
his and he has marked them for his own
65:03
uh that's like treasure to him we are
65:05
treasured to god on this earth and when
65:08
you allow yourself to be used uh like a
65:11
treasure chest that god can pull that
65:13
goodness out of you his goodness out of
65:15
you the trust you have the belief the
65:18
faith the faith the faith to stand up
65:20
and be not be uh
65:22
slow in declaring what god wants to do
65:25
or just step out and
65:27
and be a part of what he's doing that's
65:29
what that's talking about but jesus
65:31
saying pray that my people those are
65:33
those who follow him right
65:36
they're not fans of jesus they're
65:39
followers that's a whole different thing
65:41
you're not a fan okay these people jesus
65:43
say pray that my people be willing in
65:45
the day of my power that's his power
65:48
being demonstrated in us
65:51
that would be a manifested son or
65:52
daughter of god and in that day the way
65:55
he he makes them known as his treasure
65:58
is them actually doing these things
66:03
awesome awesome awesome awesome all
66:05
right um this person wants to know when
66:08
we were little spirits inside the father
66:10
before we came to the earth were we
66:12
already male and female and or was that
66:15
decided when we were sent to our
66:17
mother's womb i don't know if you would
66:19
even know the answer but i do know the
66:21
answer okay awesome he he already knew
66:25
what you would be he already knew that
66:27
and he wrote it on your soul actually he
66:31
has written things on your soul and he's
66:33
already written on your soul male or
66:35
female and i know they say it's up to
66:37
the gender of whatever or whoever does
66:40
whatever no it's up to god if his
66:42
purpose he chose you for and he chose
66:45
you as a female while you were still in
66:47
him he even sometimes will choose who
66:50
you will be married to that would be a
66:51
male
66:52
he made us male and female okay not two
66:55
males and not two females people um
66:58
that's totally against what god's whole
67:00
purpose is
67:01
to to bring a life to be able to bring
67:03
those spirits down male and a female
67:06
the other kind can't do anything and
67:08
that's just the enemy's way of i just
67:10
get this you're getting this for free
67:12
the reason why that's so prevalent right
67:14
now is anytime god's going to do
67:16
something great on the earth the devil
67:17
wants to keep
67:19
the little spirits leaving god to come
67:22
down to years to become who god
67:24
appointed us to be
67:25
so two males cannot make a baby people
67:28
and two females cannot make a baby that
67:30
is the number one reason why satan
67:32
promotes that and it's so prevalent is
67:35
he's terrified of who's going to be born
67:37
in this time and that's one way besides
67:40
abortion to stop that from happening
67:42
just so you know that yes on on on the
67:45
inside of your will that's in the core
67:48
of your being he writes on there what
67:51
you will be so he already knows if
67:53
you're going to be a male or female it
67:55
says he's written every day of your life
67:57
in the book before you even came to the
67:59
earth yes he knew if you'd be male or
68:01
female
68:02
and satan likes to twist that twist
68:05
those things so that you won't
68:06
accomplish what he wants you to so he
68:08
does know by the way he knew i would be
68:10
a female he knew the family that i would
68:12
be born into he knew the purposes he had
68:15
for me and i learned early what those
68:18
purposes were uh even when i was young i
68:21
knew that god has something special for
68:23
me even when i didn't know what it was
68:25
so i was excited uh being one of the
68:28
silent ones doesn't mean you're not a
68:29
deep thinker doesn't mean god can't be
68:31
speaking to you
68:33
i have grandchildren that already hear
68:35
him and grandchildren who are already
68:36
being caught up to show them things in
68:38
heaven oh wow
68:40
so this
68:41
this is going to happen people
68:43
and it's going to be god's way
68:45
you get to choose
68:47
this day he says i offer you life or
68:49
death
68:51
choose life so if you ever wondered what
68:53
does he think about people dying and
68:54
being murdered and killed well that
68:56
shows you right there he is totally
68:58
against
68:59
death and dying all right but even when
69:02
you do die if you belong to him it's not
69:04
a bad thing and i know that seems hard
69:06
to you but i've been in heaven many
69:08
times and people arrived i've been on
69:10
years when many people left to go to
69:11
heaven
69:13
i have seen hell i don't talk a lot
69:15
about that i'm just saying that you
69:17
don't want to go there don't ever stop
69:19
praying for your family members to know
69:20
jesus christ
69:22
and to be with you in eternity but yes
69:24
god knows who you will be
69:27
and he doesn't like it when saint begins
69:29
to pervert things but he really doesn't
69:32
like it when he begins to take the lives
69:34
of those who he sent and appointed to be
69:36
on the earth and then make their life
69:39
end
69:40
and i think to god that's one of the
69:42
worst things anybody could see could do
69:44
would be to take the life of the babies
69:47
uh and you know what happened what he
69:49
says about that
69:50
yeah oh yeah now cat you said a minute
69:53
ago that sometimes he picks even picture
69:56
uh
69:57
the person you're gonna marry i is very
69:58
clear to me that god picked doreen we're
70:00
married 44 years when we were each six
70:03
years old which is one year apart in our
70:05
age the enemy tried to kill us in our
70:08
she was on the east coast an accident
70:10
her parents were killing me i was on the
70:11
west coast the year before and in a flip
70:14
over bus accident and both of us came
70:17
out completely unscathed and then later
70:19
we found each other that's very clear to
70:21
me but i didn't hear the lord i
70:24
i just followed you and it became clear
70:26
that this is who god
70:28
had directed me you heard the lord but
70:30
there are there people who god
70:32
doesn't do that and just allows them to
70:35
make their choice of who they want to
70:36
marry
70:37
what do you see in that i think it
70:39
depends entirely on what he has chosen
70:41
you to do on the earth i think that has
70:43
a lot to do with it
70:45
uh there are certain people that he has
70:47
to have here
70:49
for appointed times and in order for
70:51
them to be able to operate in fullness
70:54
then he picks the right person that he
70:56
chose
70:57
for you in order for you to do that
71:00
there's a lot of men who would not have
71:01
put up with me being gone so much and uh
71:04
he actually had my husband take me back
71:06
to the altar and say i'm giving you back
71:07
to her for these 10 years so that you
71:09
can push her up he really did now that
71:11
doesn't mean we weren't married that
71:13
means my husband never complained about
71:15
me being gone sometimes i would be home
71:17
a day and a half and pack and leave
71:19
there were several years that i lived my
71:21
life like that when god was pushing me
71:23
out there to be known on purpose it
71:26
wasn't what i would have picked at all i
71:28
was the person who didn't care if
71:29
anybody talked to me or touched me i
71:32
like being alone a lot i have found
71:35
though that most prophets don't mind
71:36
being alone
71:38
because that gives you more time to be
71:40
with god and now for 10 years have
71:43
expired now my husband goes with me a
71:44
lot it doesn't mean god was going to
71:46
stop that that he was he was there's a
71:48
lot of people who men who wouldn't have
71:50
done that they just would say no you're
71:51
not doing that and so in order for that
71:54
doesn't mean it was maybe the perfect
71:55
person because my husband are very
71:57
opposite we still love each other and
71:59
this would be 45 years this year we'll
72:01
be married and i still think he is the
72:04
greatest thing
72:06
awesome well you know i was talking to a
72:08
young
72:09
woman she actually was on this program i
72:11
think we put her on the air once but we
72:12
were talking about you and she said i if
72:15
i understood her correctly because you
72:16
know
72:17
um but she said it it must have been
72:19
hard because i talked about how
72:21
your husband's a fisherman he loves fish
72:23
you don't even like the smell of fish
72:24
you know and so and she said that must
72:26
have been hard that must be hard for her
72:28
and i said i don't think it's hard i
72:29
think they like telling people their
72:31
opposites in those areas i don't think
72:33
it's hard for her but what would you say
72:36
is that was that made it hard for you
72:38
that he loves fishing no i just it's
72:40
very funny the sense of humor that god
72:43
has because that's what i was thinking
72:44
i'm gonna give you ways to sharpen you
72:47
you know i mean it's like jesus never
72:49
was married so he didn't didn't have the
72:51
husband and wife relationship no he was
72:54
married to church people uh so he didn't
72:57
have to do that but there's even the
72:58
angels is a good example like they
73:00
they're not married they don't get
73:01
married but god sends ones on assignment
73:04
that are total opposite personalities so
73:06
they have to sharpen each other learn to
73:09
get along and i think that god this is
73:12
what god said he said to me
73:14
i couldn't make it too easy for you
73:18
had to sharpen you
73:20
too easy for you and he said then he'll
73:22
say i didn't make it easy for my son
73:24
and that was the time he took me back
73:26
and showed me all the disciples going
73:28
down this road to go speak and what they
73:29
actually in the beginning what he
73:32
actually gave them what he gave him to
73:34
train and learn in those two short years
73:36
that was not easy for jesus
73:39
yeah the statements he made so sometimes
73:42
he'll he'll he may not means this
73:44
perfect in every way like he says every
73:46
word perfect or treats me perfect in
73:47
every way
73:48
but the one thing for sure is uh i very
73:51
much love my husband
73:54
and have fallen in love with him
73:57
more than once so that's
74:00
your husband's name is bing we call him
74:01
captain bean because he is a cat he was
74:03
a boat captain and he wears that i think
74:05
he wears that captain hat sometimes but
74:08
when he came to israel with you guys you
74:09
guys were obviously best friends i was
74:12
going to ask you this because you
74:13
brought up that the lord had taken you
74:14
back in time you were literally at the
74:16
tim
74:17
i if i'm remembering right when you and
74:19
i showed up at the tomb together was
74:21
that your first time at that tim in
74:23
person yes
74:25
but and you're saying that was the same
74:27
tune the garden team as we know it and
74:30
because you were there you'd seen it yes
74:33
yes
74:33
it had that same you know it had the
74:36
same the way it looked on the outside
74:38
except there was one piece a little bit
74:40
different and i found i didn't know
74:42
there had been an earthquake
74:44
at the team and a piece of the doorway i
74:47
think it was or the entrance had fallen
74:49
out and they had kind of repaired it and
74:51
i knew something had been done to it
74:53
because when i was taken back there it
74:55
was different i didn't know that the
74:57
earthquake had happened they had
74:58
repaired that but they even had like the
75:01
stonework where
75:02
um
75:03
it's like the stone has to ride in a um
75:06
like a train rider
75:15
and then that stone was in there that
75:17
would roll over to the the mouth of the
75:19
tomb and then be rolled away
75:22
and um but there was there were flowers
75:24
back when i saw it there were flowers
75:26
planted in that place except of course
75:28
where the stone came and well there was
75:30
flowers right there and that's where i
75:32
saw jesus standing i saw the various
75:34
place where he stood and had his back
75:36
turned to me when i was there and of
75:39
course the two angels were still uh
75:41
there yeah i was phenomenal and you know
75:43
when we had uh there was a jewish
75:46
messianic jewish
75:48
uh believer about 22 years ago when he
75:49
went to first went to israel and he was
75:52
very much down on
75:54
against that this garden team was the
75:56
right place it was more likely because
75:58
of his studies he said it was in this
76:00
place because they take you to two
76:01
places at least they did 22 years ago
76:04
and then this one was inside and there
76:06
but
76:07
but
76:08
i find it phenomenal because the guy
76:09
that did the presentation showed us the
76:12
the place of the skull and that had been
76:14
damaged by an earthquake because when i
76:15
saw it 22 years earlier you could see
76:17
the skull and then some of it was broken
76:19
away but it's interesting because you
76:21
felt the anointing you had been there
76:24
that solves the
76:26
you know it doesn't matter what an
76:27
expert in israel says it only matters
76:30
that you you felt the anointing and uh
76:33
you said we went into the team together
76:35
and you said and you felt it you know i
76:37
didn't
76:38
really strong yeah
76:40
yeah that's amazing to me
76:42
could you visualize uh back in the day
76:46
where he would have laid exactly do you
76:48
remember when we went inside could you
76:50
see he is he was right here yeah because
76:51
he was still life there there was still
76:54
light on the very place he laid
76:56
oh wow
76:57
the glory and the anointing will remain
77:01
in places it's like i think i also told
77:03
you
77:04
that i actually got to go in where they
77:05
have king david's tomb that actually has
77:08
his body in it
77:09
and um
77:10
they they have a curtain dividing that
77:12
the women can go on one side and the men
77:14
on the other but oh my goodness i could
77:16
feel the anointing the anointing stays
77:18
in the bones that's when they threw that
77:21
person over the you know the uh into the
77:24
pit of wherever that was and his body
77:26
hit elisha's bones remember that yeah
77:31
because the anointing stays with the
77:33
body part the anointing stays with the
77:36
body
77:37
and so i felt such anointing coming from
77:40
king david's tomb uh so it was it was
77:43
such a delight to be there that i got to
77:45
see all these things like where where
77:46
the holy spirit came zoom in the upper
77:48
room and there's still a fiery portal
77:50
there where he came in uh where that
77:52
happened but the two angels at the tomb
77:55
i was not expecting that and i did know
77:58
there were two angels there the bible
78:00
talks about the two angels
78:02
part of their reward was they got to
78:05
stay and that they call it a holy place
78:07
even heaven calls it a holy place it's
78:09
where he was that he died where he was
78:11
buried where he rose from the dead came
78:13
up from hell and got his body back is a
78:16
very powerfully anointed place um and
78:18
his anointing was still inside the tomb
78:21
where his body laid for those three days
78:24
that's amazing that's just amazing to me
78:27
um and then i came out we came out of
78:29
the tomb
78:30
and i looked up to the left uh julie
78:33
smith who is our producer in here hadn't
78:35
gone in at the same time but she i think
78:37
she'd either just gone in but she was
78:39
standing up on the stairs watching us
78:41
come out and she says i have never felt
78:43
an anointing like i feel here and she
78:45
operates in a strong sea or anointing
78:47
you know so
78:48
you both had said the same thing within
78:50
about a minute and a half of each other
78:52
so i thought wow this is the place you
78:54
know so i encourage anyone to go by the
78:56
way people have asked us we we had
78:58
stopped the israel tour because they
79:00
were they were requiring more
79:02
vaccinations and mass than anybody on
79:04
the earth so when that clears up
79:06
probably next year we'll do an israel
79:08
tour by the way
79:09
that's about our time today are you you
79:12
your um cruises are full are you doing
79:14
one or two and they're full i can't
79:16
remember what the deal is on the cruises
79:19
well they actually have um they the
79:22
royal caribbean stopped those cruises
79:26
they were full at one point but the one
79:28
to greece and then there was one i think
79:30
to the eastern caribbean right jen yeah
79:32
like saint thomas and saint martins we
79:34
had that they were pretty much booked um
79:37
but they stopped it because they were
79:40
going to require vaccinations
79:42
and uh and nobody wanted that so it's i
79:46
guess it's on hold it's like i think
79:48
they gave the people who had paid you
79:49
can either go ahead and get your refund
79:51
or keep it here and when it reopens they
79:53
fully intend to do those those cruises i
79:57
think they were even considering one for
79:59
alaska for me like in the summer time to
80:01
do a cruise to alaska yeah which i
80:04
didn't know that i ever want to take but
80:05
here's pretty it's beautiful there and
80:07
there's not like as much ice and snow
80:11
in there but but the greece one is
80:13
definitely still on hold or still want
80:14
to go to greece
80:16
and um
80:17
and so i do know that i think in in the
80:19
coming future i'll probably will do
80:21
three a year with them oh wow yeah
80:23
they're fun i've been on dream i've been
80:25
on a lot of cruises but my favorite one
80:28
was whatever that's been seven eight
80:30
years ago i've lost a little track of
80:32
time when we went on we didn't we
80:33
weren't doing it with you we attended it
80:35
while you were speaking because i wanted
80:36
to check you out you know and i had said
80:38
does anybody know is kat the real deal
80:40
and julie had said you were and victoria
80:43
boyson had said you were and so i said
80:45
i'm going on this victoria
80:48
but you end up
80:49
in our room we were there for like four
80:51
hours or something like that they
80:52
couldn't find it i don't remember
80:53
exactly or two hours whatever it was it
80:55
was a long and that the the moment that
80:57
was my favorite i don't know why just
80:59
this one answer
81:01
and i said cat
81:02
this says seven eight nine years i said
81:04
are you telling me as you're sitting
81:06
here that you've sat and had a
81:09
conversation with the god of the entire
81:11
universe father god just like that and
81:13
you go
81:14
yes and i'm going and i believed it
81:17
i actually believed it when he said i i
81:19
went because in me
81:21
you might as well blasted me with the
81:22
spirit even though i didn't feel
81:23
anything i thought
81:25
that is cool because i totally believed
81:28
it i saw it on your face yeah and i can
81:30
say this for sure god definitely picked
81:32
doreen for you because she never
81:33
complained once the whole time we were
81:35
in there these are very important he was
81:37
listening and enjoying it but but you
81:38
were like like
81:40
you were just
81:44
that wasn't the only time we talked at
81:46
the dining table we were offered the
81:47
dining room to get together and i think
81:50
um
81:51
steve swanson was there he was doing
81:53
worship i believe and uh so they sent us
81:56
around this one big table with uh um
81:59
uh pastor mike in them and the whole
82:01
time we were doing nothing but talking
82:04
back and forth right while they were
82:05
eating uh
82:07
because
82:08
that was being hold on a whole lot but i
82:10
didn't mind because there's so much
82:12
revelation to share i'm always when
82:14
somebody is hungry god said if they're
82:16
there you'll share so i have a mandate
82:19
so there you'll share my husband will
82:21
just go eat away and enjoy it that he's
82:22
not the one having to talk
82:25
yeah i mean i was a sponge on that trip
82:27
i went wanting to learn about him and i
82:30
bought a bunch of books that i brought
82:32
with me on the cruise but that but yours
82:34
was the one you know that really yeah
82:36
brought here soon well anyway cat that
82:39
was really really really good today
82:40
sorry we didn't get a number of
82:42
questions answered but we will folks we
82:43
got the list
82:47
but we're getting really really really
82:49
good revelation today so tell people
82:51
what they can get there
82:52
revealinghaven.com and anything else we
82:54
see on the screen we've got
82:55
revealingheaven.com
82:57
revealingheaven.com is one of my
82:59
websites and that's where we post our
83:01
events our upcoming events
83:04
and we also have our store there because
83:07
when god
83:08
said that i would do this he said that
83:10
you will have products that you can sell
83:12
to make money to help support what
83:14
you're doing and he said but those
83:15
products aren't going to be normal
83:17
they're all going to be wrapped around
83:18
heaven truth on heaven or different
83:20
things that the holy spirit wants to say
83:22
and i always show this cup because it's
83:24
a good example this is one of the things
83:26
that the holy spirit gave me this to say
83:28
and put on a cup and it says i don't do
83:32
demons
83:33
and it starts a big conference you see
83:35
the lightning bolt right there in the
83:36
middle and i said that's satan being
83:38
taken out of heaven people every time
83:39
you see that
83:40
and uh so
83:42
so he he gives me all kinds of things to
83:44
say and do we're gonna have a whole line
83:46
of apparel we'll be putting out and um
83:49
home decor we're going to be putting out
83:51
with sayings of heaven or scenes from
83:53
heaven that we'll be putting out in this
83:55
year god wants to flood the earth with
83:57
revelation and that revelation can be by
84:00
word it could be by images it could by
84:03
by things that represent and the holy
84:05
spirit said why can't we have things
84:07
rather than heaven the devil's been
84:09
doing it
84:11
the devil's got his mark and his image
84:13
on a lot of things and god says about
84:15
time we put heaven and and and the host
84:18
image on things so
84:19
so that's what that website's for i have
84:21
catker.com
84:23
which is where there's it's a spiritual
84:25
platform for the father to say whatever
84:27
he wants to that's exactly what that is
84:29
and he does say whatever he wants to
84:32
and uh so there's different interviews
84:34
i've had with different people you know
84:36
patricia king is one of them she was
84:37
real precious uh enjoyed talking with
84:39
her so much
84:41
and then there's also all kinds of
84:43
videos that you can watch that will
84:45
train you
84:46
in different things in the spirit and
84:48
things that the father has for all of us
84:50
on the earth and it is the only way
84:54
that you can give to me online if that
84:56
is your decision to do it go to
84:57
catcure.com click on the treasury
85:00
or you can become a member of the
85:01
guardian zone those are our monthly
85:03
supporters and i know that for you steve
85:05
also that you help us you mean so much
85:09
to us that you are actually
85:11
giving to heaven's plan
85:13
whether it's me doing something or steve
85:16
and i want to remind everybody out there
85:18
steve is important to god whether he'll
85:20
ever say it or not he has opened a door
85:23
and put a platform out there for god's
85:26
prophets to speak his words and i have
85:30
to add what the holy spirit showed me he
85:32
said it's even more than elijah list
85:35
where you would send out all the emails
85:37
and i know probably probably millions of
85:39
them been sent out the way you would get
85:41
the word way back then was you would
85:43
join the join the list and they would
85:44
email you words of what god said
85:47
prophets but now that elijah's stream is
85:50
here
85:52
god said it's another whole level
85:54
because you're not just reading the word
85:57
you know man should not live by bread
85:59
alone that's the written word whether
86:01
it's words from god or the word but by
86:04
every word spoken from the mouth of god
86:07
and aligned to streams this is what the
86:09
father said the father holy spirit
86:11
elijah's streams allows him to speak to
86:14
the mouth of man of his prophets
86:17
so that
86:18
men shall not live without every word
86:21
being spoken from the mouth of god he
86:22
said that's what elijah's dreams does
86:25
that's why it's so powerful so so
86:27
terrifies the devil that you have
86:29
allowed to do that and it's also going
86:32
to not stop growing so all those who
86:34
give to elijah's dreams and help that
86:37
make happen you're actually helping the
86:39
father to have a way to speak
86:41
his honorable word to people in the
86:43
earth
86:44
wow well thank you kent that's very kind
86:46
of you to say that and i received that
86:48
word wow that's powerful
86:50
i'll tell people who we're going to have
86:52
tomorrow's a new guest um andrea
86:55
holbart is a friend that i dream and i
86:57
met 18 years ago at a kim clement
87:00
conference who stayed in touch on and
87:01
off she's a flight attendant
87:03
by
87:04
occupation even then 18 years ago and
87:07
still is i'm not we won't mention the
87:09
airline because she wants to keep that
87:10
part but she's
87:12
she's a prophetic voice there but she
87:15
has
87:16
grown
87:17
in this airline to be one of those that
87:18
they bring in to train to look for
87:20
traffic children being trafficked on the
87:22
airlines and she'll talk about that what
87:24
god has shown her and then god's given
87:27
her some revelation on 45. i'll just say
87:29
it that way that she wants to share and
87:32
i've learned to trust her prophetic
87:33
voice so you're going to really enjoy it
87:35
she's a dear friend of drean and i
87:37
and that'll be good so that's tomorrow's

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 66
by ElijahStreams Mar 2, 2022
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qraxPVg2Zbo
or https://youtu.be/qraxPVg2Zbo

01:35
hey welcome to elijah's dreams it's uh
01:38
happy wednesday march 2 2022. glad to
01:41
have you here sorry we're a little bit
01:43
late today we're going to get going
01:44
right away in just a few minutes we're
01:45
bringing on cat curves uh as you all
01:48
remember is one of our favorites your
01:51
favorite so this could be great
01:52
uh i just wanted to uh make only one
01:55
kind of announcement there's a lot of
01:57
times we give words of knowledge
01:59
and after the the show
02:02
we get pummeled in a good way with
02:04
people writing in and saying that was me
02:06
that was me that was me you would be
02:07
surprised
02:08
almost any potent word about five people
02:10
they
02:11
will write in at least five and say that
02:13
was an exact fit
02:15
for them and in every case it really is
02:18
because they'll tell us their situation
02:20
i had a word the other day about casting
02:22
out nines and it was a very strange word
02:24
i'd never given such a word but i said
02:26
why did this pop in my head yesterday
02:29
where i was thinking about this new math
02:31
of mathematics not new it's an old
02:34
rec for those that are into math might
02:36
have heard that uh
02:37
technique about casting out nines when
02:39
you're uh
02:41
i think long
02:42
addition and there's you do these things
02:44
and you add this if you see a nine you
02:46
you cast it out i don't know how to do
02:47
it really i just if you google it or
02:50
you'll find out what casting out nines
02:51
was so all of a sudden god gave me that
02:53
word about casting out nines and i said
02:55
it may have to do with uh
02:57
um
02:59
some of you are feeling and i'm just
03:00
gonna paraphrase it that some of you are
03:02
feeling like a castaway or cast off or
03:04
you felt cast off and it has something
03:06
to do with nine and i said maybe
03:08
february 29 someone answered confirmed
03:11
that i said you might be one of what
03:12
nine children i believe that's the way i
03:14
said it that was on andrea hobart's
03:16
program
03:17
and i had a bunch of people that said
03:19
i'm one of nine children and i've always
03:20
felt like a castaway or cast off
03:23
so i had a situation um and i gave this
03:26
word i'm gonna just tell you two quick
03:28
ones one lady wrote in and said she was
03:30
one of nine and it always felt like
03:33
she was a cast off cast cast out of her
03:35
family outcast i think is the one i was
03:37
trying to play
03:39
and um so then she talked about how she
03:42
was one of those that just loved it i
03:44
don't know if she used the word
03:45
adrenaline but scary things she loves
03:47
scary things that frighten you like
03:50
bungee jumping or whatever it is that
03:52
she's she would have said and i said
03:54
it's interesting that you would say that
03:56
and you feel like an
03:58
outcast because i said five years ago
04:00
the only other time i've ever given this
04:02
word in fact it was the only time i ever
04:04
gave this word
04:05
uh i was in a conference and i called
04:08
out i was actually enjoying the
04:09
conference along with everybody else i
04:10
wasn't speaking and there was a young
04:13
woman there dressed um whatever you
04:15
could say conservatively
04:17
uh and i came over to her and i said i
04:19
have a word for you can i is it okay and
04:21
then she immediately started motioning
04:23
me to come back into the lobby because
04:25
it turns out she didn't speak english at
04:27
all she's cuban so she brought back an
04:29
interpreter with her and i i said boy
04:31
lord i hope i get this right because he
04:33
didn't look anything like the word but
04:34
the word was
04:37
the lord loves the way you like to be
04:39
scared you like to do adrenaline i see
04:41
you in a jeep doing scary things bungee
04:43
jumping i began with and she immediately
04:45
broke down sobbing because it was an
04:47
exact match to her
04:49
um and so that lady the other day and
04:51
this lady from cuba
04:53
really illustrates the point that god
04:55
made you the way you are and many of you
04:57
are feeling like outcast but the reality
04:59
is god specifically made you the way you
05:01
are to enjoy the things whether it's art
05:03
or music or
05:05
or any kind of thing that makes you
05:06
strange to the rest of the group god
05:09
probably was in that when he made you
05:11
that way um and if there were things
05:13
that didn't get redeemed he'll redeem
05:15
that so anyway i wanted to share that
05:16
the other thing i want to share real
05:17
quick was andre who who was the guest
05:20
for the day god began to tell her after
05:22
the show to look for the code look for
05:25
his code
05:27
in the show itself even even the things
05:29
that we were saying god had another
05:30
message and so she began to research it
05:34
and realized that when i was talking
05:35
about castaways or outcasts having to do
05:38
with the number nine as we spoke they
05:40
were debating
05:41
in congress whether they could go ahead
05:43
and pass this law that would allow
05:46
abortion right up to the ninth month
05:48
just before
05:49
delivery that you were able to kill the
05:51
baby inside the arm you were able to
05:53
cast it off and you might remember if
05:55
you watched that this anointing came on
05:56
me and i i even had tears
05:59
and it was intense and god's anger
06:01
burned against the enemies we cast out
06:03
and said i have
06:04
not cast you off so i hope you'll watch
06:07
that but uh there's just so you know
06:09
when we have all these words of
06:10
knowledge
06:11
virtually everyone gets answered maybe
06:14
there's one once in a while that nobody
06:16
responds to but it's extremely common
06:18
for every word we give to have someone
06:20
respond to it so i thought i would tell
06:22
you that because we can't replay them
06:23
all all the time so all right let's
06:24
bring kat in here and we'll get going
06:26
here
06:28
cat cat cat there he is there she is hey
06:30
good good to see you kat it's good to
06:32
see you too how are you doing today
06:36
well um i am awake
06:38
[Laughter]
06:41
this is your kind of morning hours right
06:43
this is for you this is morning
06:45
well the other day i had an hour and a
06:47
half sleep and so
06:49
i went like probably
06:52
20 hours
06:54
um just getting stuff done and doing
06:56
things that i had to
06:58
and so yeah i finally i think i finally
07:00
laid down on 8 30 a.m this morning was
07:04
when but i'm wide awake now i'm excited
07:06
to feel with god and excited about the
07:08
days we're living in
07:10
and i'm wearing these colors they
07:12
represent royalty
07:14
um i i love the color purple
07:16
mainly because of that
07:18
um there's a lot of that in the throne
07:19
room of god a lot of purple uh this
07:22
cobalt blue color
07:24
uh deep colors beautiful things but
07:26
anyway i'm really excited about what god
07:28
has been speaking about
07:30
right now in this world now
07:32
not waiting for things to clear up or or
07:34
go away or people wanting to run and
07:37
hide and yet the power of god is about
07:40
to be uh just displayed everywhere in
07:42
this earth the earth is the lord and the
07:44
fullness thereof it belongs to him not
07:48
to hell not to the left not to anyone
07:51
and what he says is what's going to
07:53
happen so i just want to once again um
07:56
let everyone know that i know it doesn't
07:58
look good to you
08:00
but god does know what's going on and
08:02
yes he does expect us to say something
08:04
against the darkness and stand up and be
08:06
somebody for him
08:08
and so instead of the opposite going
08:10
through your mind or your heart you need
08:12
to be filled with him it's real simple
08:15
i'm just gonna just declare right now
08:18
show you right now at the beginning of
08:19
the show that if you're being bothered
08:22
with issues of uh like you're abandoned
08:24
like you're rejected like you're not
08:26
wanted
08:28
that is a spirit trying to control you
08:30
you need to just cast out that spirit of
08:33
fear from you lose that from your soul
08:36
lose all fears cares concerns you know a
08:39
rejection a dishonor that people unjust
08:43
criticism and judgment against you just
08:45
get it out of you and then you just say
08:48
these words father i choose my will to
08:50
bind to my soul
08:52
which is who you are god's life his love
08:56
his presence his validation his
09:00
expectation his will his way his joy his
09:04
celebration right now in jesus name and
09:08
what you've just done was remove
09:10
everything the enemy's been trying to
09:11
put in you instead you were now having
09:14
on the inside of you what god wants you
09:17
to say what he is planned for you and
09:19
who you really are and it is so
09:22
important in these days to make sure you
09:25
don't let your soul grieve or be sad
09:27
then he will use sadness against you
09:29
even as a weapon don't keep it in you
09:32
you do not have to because then you will
09:35
prosper and be in health
09:38
even if it prospers and so i know the
09:41
father has me i tell perfect strangers
09:44
this on sidewalks inside their cafes or
09:47
anywhere if i see that they have a great
09:49
cloud around them i'll go over and say
09:51
do you need help and i'll say you need
09:53
to do god he's made a way for you to get
09:55
rid of that i don't care who they are
09:57
even what they what who what their
09:59
religious
10:00
belief system they have i just
10:03
introduced god in that way and right
10:05
there i'll have them lose all that stuff
10:07
from their soul
10:09
jesus comes down and pulls it out and
10:11
then they are then now
10:13
being consumed with every word they
10:15
speak because the light begins to go in
10:18
their soul and the layers of your soul
10:21
what's in there is what you will be what
10:23
you display the emotions you will have
10:26
and instantly within minutes these very
10:28
people who had a cloud of you know uh
10:32
fear or rejection or just abandonment
10:35
whatever it was around them is gone it
10:37
is totally gone and the light of god
10:40
comes on them and you're changed in
10:43
seconds and so i want to encourage
10:44
people if you need that in your life no
10:47
matter what anyone is saying about you
10:49
what things look like you begin to say
10:51
those words every single day and you'll
10:55
be so filled with god there'll be no
10:58
room for the enemies words or
11:00
controlling manipulating stealing
11:02
killing people's words they'll be out of
11:06
you and then you're ready to do things
11:08
for god because in these days we are
11:09
ruling with jesus christ
11:12
good good good well you know hey i want
11:14
to ask you a question even before we get
11:16
into these questions that i have in
11:18
front of me
11:19
um
11:20
as a follow-up to what we did with
11:23
manuel yesterday manuel johnson you know
11:25
him his gifting she's very different
11:27
than you in almost every way except
11:30
you and man will share one unique
11:33
from my observation is he god will show
11:35
him he'll either take him to the future
11:37
or he'll show him a vision for him he'll
11:40
show him what is what will be he'll take
11:42
him to the present in the future time
11:45
he'll take him to the future and it's
11:46
the prayer he does that for you so my
11:48
question was
11:50
so god
11:51
told you how this was going to turn out
11:53
who would be the president who was going
11:56
to be shamed and taken you know whatever
11:58
whether they're arrested or they're just
11:59
shamed away
12:01
yeah does he then in all of the ensuing
12:04
months
12:06
not hardly give you any details at all
12:09
because he's
12:10
told you what the end is
12:12
and therefore so people will come and
12:14
say well
12:17
how can this be how is this possible and
12:20
you're saying what i saw is that what it
12:21
is you just you don't have the details
12:23
god rarely gives you the details or what
12:25
how does that work for you
12:26
he does give me details many times and
12:29
when he takes me somewhere i am actually
12:32
there
12:33
yeah
12:34
actually in the future
12:36
what he shows me in the future i am in
12:38
that future time it's not a vision of
12:40
that time it's not thoughts about that
12:42
time he literally takes me into that
12:45
time and what i see is reality it's it's
12:48
not it's not just a mystery it's really
12:51
truly what life will be in those times
12:54
he shows me that and when you've seen it
12:56
yourself and you've been there no one
12:59
can take that away from you but you
13:01
should just as fierce about the very
13:04
promises god gave you and you know he
13:06
gave them to you it doesn't regardless
13:08
of what's going on now that you're
13:10
seeing in the earth and man's realm
13:13
uh god's purposes and plans supersede
13:16
all of that
13:18
and since god has been from the
13:19
beginning to the end and the end to the
13:22
beginning he does know what's going to
13:25
happen and yes he does sometimes just
13:28
let the time take its course if he's
13:30
training people and things or he's about
13:32
to introduce something time is
13:35
everything on when when god is releasing
13:38
something in a new time he's not going
13:40
to wait for things to clear up okay he
13:43
will make sure the enemy gets crushed
13:46
and pushed back but your words are very
13:48
powerful in these days and that's
13:49
something he never stopped saying and by
13:51
the way steve he talks to me almost
13:54
every single day this is never a
13:56
one-time thing when he shows me
13:58
something uh he'll show me sometimes
14:00
many times uh the same kind of place
14:04
any place let me see it all over again
14:07
question my soul
14:08
i see details every time he takes me
14:11
when i say i've seen that celebration of
14:13
many times now that literally will
14:16
happen and people go how will that
14:18
happen how is that possible that's kind
14:20
of
14:21
that's got faith people you have to
14:23
believe god who is sovereign you believe
14:26
him for who he is who made everything by
14:29
those things that you do not see
14:32
he made everything do you think he
14:34
cannot say something or do something in
14:37
days that he has things plain on his own
14:40
timeline those things might not maybe
14:43
happen they will happen to me it matters
14:47
not how they happen i know they will
14:50
happen and i know what life will be and
14:53
we're entering into the greatest days
14:55
we've ever seen on this earth and in
14:57
order for those great days to happen he
14:59
has to expose in full detail the evil
15:03
the wickedness who's involved in it and
15:06
let me tell you what the father said
15:08
after this whole thing when it's like
15:10
dust to us and these days we're going
15:13
through they will be like dust some
15:15
people involved in them they will be
15:17
dust that's how he says it to me
15:19
some will not survive this i'm talking
15:21
about the evil and the wicked not that
15:23
he doesn't love them but they've made
15:24
their choices
15:26
and and this is a sea time in harvest
15:29
time so all we've been seeding with our
15:31
lives with our mouths uh with our
15:34
choices over these last three years
15:36
we're about to get a major harvest no
15:39
demon no man no government official
15:42
nobody can stop that from happening so
15:46
greatness and glory and acceleration is
15:48
coming to the one side but justice and
15:51
demise and a
15:53
judgment being done and also not just
15:57
judgment but
15:58
some people are going to be incarcerated
16:00
some will lose everything they have
16:02
because they've been cheating and
16:03
stealing everywhere in this world they
16:05
will lose everything they have because
16:08
that was the choice they made to kill
16:09
steal and destroy and when you do that
16:12
in the sea time and harvest time you've
16:14
already seated for your downfall i'm
16:17
talking about the wicked
16:19
justice has to come it's going to come
16:22
but for the other side who continue to
16:24
go forward to love to help to inspire
16:26
and encourage
16:28
greatness of acceleration is coming to
16:30
shove you even further out in front so
16:32
people will know who to believe who to
16:34
trust so god does have uh his way of
16:38
doing things which is already taking
16:40
place that nobody can stop
16:42
and when he makes a declaration himself
16:44
from his throne it's going to happen
16:48
and count when there when uh there's a
16:50
scripture that says believe in his pro
16:52
not believe it believe his prophets and
16:55
you will prosper itself it's an odd
16:57
promise it's like you can prosper or not
16:59
prosper here's the here's the key in the
17:01
in that scripture believe what his
17:03
prophets say
17:05
just believe it
17:06
and because a minute ago you said if i
17:08
if i quoted you roughly correctly you
17:10
said you don't really care how it's
17:12
going to happen or something like that
17:14
you said but just god showed you that's
17:17
going to happen in your case you're
17:18
believing god
17:19
in our case we're
17:21
believing you who's believing god and of
17:23
course by believing you
17:24
we're believing god so
17:27
is that so people that that are in this
17:29
situation are going man it's been a
17:30
month it's been a year and some months
17:32
and
17:33
and
17:34
i can't see how it's going to happen is
17:36
there a is god looking at this thing and
17:38
saying look i said when the son of man
17:41
comes will he find faith on the earth
17:43
you i told you to cat a prophet you've
17:45
watched her be consistent so is he
17:48
expecting his people
17:50
to not stress out over the how it's
17:52
going to happen because that's a lack of
17:54
faith
17:55
he is absolutely expecting them not to
17:58
be stressed or not to be fearful if they
18:01
really are believing him uh and i say if
18:04
you can't even believe him and trust him
18:06
at least trust him
18:07
you know he made everything the word
18:10
says he does he's proven that over and
18:11
over again he himself talking about the
18:13
father he knows what he wants done and
18:16
he knows when it will happen he's trying
18:18
to keep you on the path so you don't
18:21
lose a great reward you don't lose
18:23
acceleration and so i tell people uh
18:26
believing him there's belief trust and
18:29
then you step into faith faith is an
18:32
actual thing there come a day when you
18:34
keep believing and trusting him but you
18:36
say it i don't care if it's in your own
18:38
home i choose to be what god said i
18:40
choose to believe what he has for this
18:42
time not what man is saying not what the
18:44
devil is playing i'm choosing the living
18:46
god and he will start to put something
18:49
in you to make you stronger in one day
18:52
a prophet an unknown prophet called me
18:54
one day he said this day
18:56
god has said you have stepped from trust
18:58
and belief you've stepped into faith and
19:00
he'll never take that measure of faith
19:03
away from you and that measure of faith
19:05
now gives you favor without
19:09
so when measurement are doing this it's
19:11
not really you so much trying to make it
19:13
happen although helping god if you want
19:16
to call it that is what you're declaring
19:18
from your own mouth you shall have
19:20
whatever you say
19:22
if you declare a thing a decree thing
19:24
you do not down your head that's going
19:26
to be established unto you so you want
19:27
to you want fear established in you you
19:30
want destruction established unto you or
19:32
do you want the very words god said do
19:34
you want what he's saying that even in
19:37
these days it will be powerful it'll be
19:39
great the glory is coming the fire of
19:41
god is coming you need to talk about
19:43
those things that he has planned because
19:46
these people who are out there doing
19:48
this stuff they will be nobody and they
19:50
will be nothing one day but where will
19:52
you be standing with god when the sting
19:55
hole clears are you gonna be on his path
19:57
filled with faith because of what you
19:59
have chosen to believe yourself even if
20:02
no one else in your family is believing
20:04
it you need to believe what god says if
20:07
you believe he's holding you in his hand
20:09
he knows his plans for you he's not
20:11
going to let you fall you need to begin
20:13
to say that yourself out loud and i've
20:16
learned this this is really a truth in
20:18
the spirit realm what you begin to say
20:21
and believe causes faith to rise in you
20:24
the possibility of doing these
20:26
supernatural things to rise in you but
20:28
you won't do it if you're not saying it
20:31
i remember when i began i could begin to
20:33
say you know to god i want to be just
20:35
like him and he was delighted when i
20:37
said that that i choose to believe him
20:39
against all else and i know that my
20:41
faith is with him i know he has plans
20:43
for me and i said yes one day i know
20:45
that i will walk on water i will walk on
20:48
air i will not fall i know that i'll
20:51
succeed in everything you've said or
20:52
everything you've promised i will travel
20:54
in the spirit i will raise the dead in
20:57
mass i will will speak to the volcanoes
20:59
i will speak to the earthquakes all
21:01
these things he'd show me what happened
21:02
i began to say they would happen even if
21:05
it wasn't me i said they would happen
21:07
and right immediately when i began to
21:09
say that those things begin to happen
21:12
okay i walked on in here i've been into
21:15
the supernatural i had the veins of the
21:17
rainbow coming from me uh people seeing
21:20
fire in my eyes because these things
21:22
that he said are coming you have to
21:25
declare them yourself and you begin to
21:27
build a habitation of heaven in your
21:29
life instead of the lies and the stuff
21:31
that the fake news is putting out or
21:33
people feel what fear are putting out
21:35
you don't live with those people they
21:38
don't say who you are god says who you
21:41
are you're his son his daughter and you
21:44
need to stay on that path that he put
21:46
you on and not begin to change your mind
21:48
oh god change his mind i try you he has
21:51
not changed his mind he will perform
21:54
every word spoken by his true prophets
21:57
is what he will do because he told them
22:00
he would do it and let me tell you
22:02
cannot tell a prophet of god that they
22:05
need to start saying something else
22:06
because they're listening to him alone
22:09
speaking for him because of what he said
22:11
and what he showed them you're not
22:13
getting them off the path you put them
22:14
on because they don't want to miss their
22:16
destiny with god and you don't have to
22:19
miss yours either
22:21
that's good that's good
22:22
well you know it reminds me what when
22:24
this the election happened in uh 2020
22:29
uh our 20 is it 19 is it and then 20 it
22:32
was a 2020 election but it happened in
22:35
i don't know i forget what
22:37
it's 2020 probably
22:38
it was 2020 november the third was when
22:41
the 2020 election happened in november
22:45
it was looking good and then it started
22:46
looking i said what's going on hey
22:48
they're closing this area they're
22:49
closing the state early because they're
22:51
supposedly i thought what's going on and
22:53
my heart began to sink and sink and then
22:56
drain walked into the door she had been
22:58
gone for a while and
22:59
and i did she said how's it going i go
23:01
you know not not such faith king i just
23:04
said i don't understand what i'm seeing
23:06
and
23:07
then she began to be a little bit
23:09
discouraging and all of a sudden kat
23:11
as if god went
23:14
in front of me this my spirit just went
23:16
up and i said god is not going to turn
23:18
his back on all the people who prayed
23:20
these prayers they're gonna do that
23:22
because blah blah blah you know because
23:24
people are making up stories about this
23:26
was trump's fault they were already
23:27
making excuses for a loss
23:29
and i just this thing came over me i
23:31
said it with my mouth and that changed
23:33
the whole atmosphere in the house
23:35
in the room and so it's you know it's
23:38
kind of what you're describing that's
23:39
what i went to when you just described
23:41
that using your mouth and if you
23:43
remember we were gonna only broadcast
23:45
through november the third and then we
23:47
weren't gonna have any more and god had
23:49
said when you tell steve i want november
23:51
the 4th i need to say something in
23:53
november the 4th before any of that
23:55
happened he said that so guess what when
23:58
they shut it down immediately
24:00
right next to me he said to me this is
24:03
when they're going to cheat and steal
24:05
the election they'll bury the ballots
24:07
burn the ballots fake ballots i mean he
24:09
went down this whole list of exactly
24:11
what they were doing while he was saying
24:13
to me he was telling me what was going
24:15
to happen and then on november the 4th
24:18
god said it that's what we said on that
24:20
show this is what god said last night
24:22
they stole the election uh they're
24:24
stealing it they're putting millions of
24:26
extra votes in um they have made fake
24:29
ballots they had them waiting to put in
24:31
there to count them and that's why they
24:33
closed early it wasn't because they were
24:34
overwhelmed by how tired they were
24:37
because that was their plan to steal it
24:40
so trump won and i got to say it he won
24:44
just like god said he would win the 2020
24:46
election he won they stole it when you
24:48
steal you don't win
24:51
that's right yeah
24:53
they didn't win they still don't have
24:55
power to be where they're at they're
24:57
operating with no power or authority
25:00
given to them by man or by god okay we
25:04
voted 100 million people voted for
25:08
righteousness justice liberty and
25:09
freedom and they didn't have
25:11
anything like what they said they did
25:13
and they made it however many they
25:15
needed they put more than enough of the
25:17
cheating line and stealing to look like
25:20
that the election flipped in the favor
25:22
of the other person db person that's all
25:24
he'll let me call him and i can tell you
25:27
right now god will have his way justice
25:29
is going to come and they will have to
25:31
say with their own mouths the media will
25:34
have to say these words we were wrong
25:37
that election was stolen trump is our
25:40
president he deserves this four years
25:41
they're going to say it people i don't
25:43
care what you think anyone in the earth
25:45
thinks or the lying cheating stealing
25:47
people you can't stop it from happening
25:50
because this is the time for justice to
25:52
be served it will be served he won and
25:55
that's all i can that's all i'm saying
25:57
about that
25:58
one he is the president people the other
26:01
person is a fake and a fraud and whether
26:04
anybody likes it or not that is the
26:06
truth get your head out of the stand get
26:08
it out of your soul stop listening to
26:10
the lying fake news they're probably
26:12
gonna lose their network i can tell you
26:13
right now new ones even as i'm speaking
26:16
are rising up that would be so powerful
26:18
in years they will tell the truth yes
26:21
you will know it is the truth and this
26:23
is what god has got planned days of
26:26
glory of truth of
26:28
of justice is coming and no one can stop
26:30
that from happening because you're not
26:32
god and he is and he will have his way
26:35
and that's what he was saying to me no i
26:37
never was in fear i knew immediately
26:40
what they had done because he told me on
26:42
november the 3rd in the evening as he's
26:44
saying well we're going to shut down now
26:46
you know we'll pick it up in the morning
26:47
and i'm like nah that cannot be
26:49
happening and the father said no this is
26:51
when they're gonna cheat and steal it so
26:53
guess what he knew before they even
26:55
started doing it he knew what they were
26:57
doing so you can hide nothing from the
27:00
eyes of god and if you think he's doing
27:02
nothing you don't know him yeah and you
27:06
know kat let me just make this statement
27:07
you agree or disagree but i i watched i
27:10
could only handle the first
27:12
first third of the state of the union i
27:14
couldn't handle it past that but i would
27:16
say for anyone that's doubting if you go
27:18
back and watch it or maybe you did watch
27:19
it and ask yourself this question is the
27:22
blessing of god
27:24
is the favor of god on that
27:26
b person you call him the b person i'll
27:28
call him 46. is the blessing of god on
27:31
him or not on him it's not on him it's
27:34
not on him there's no favor there's no
27:36
blessing there's no mercy there's no
27:38
grace
27:40
yeah
27:41
it stumbles down
27:44
when when people are wicked and evil
27:47
they cannot create anything good if you
27:51
wonder what's wrong with that whole
27:52
group they're wicked the wicked cannot
27:55
create good there's never going to be a
27:57
good thing come out of any of this
27:59
that's going to be seen in the earth
28:02
they'll be known as some of the worst
28:03
people on the face of the earth because
28:05
of what they try to do you you're
28:08
colluding with hell actually that's who
28:10
you're colluding with help can't create
28:12
anything good there's nothing good in
28:14
them there's no life in them they're
28:16
only death killing stealing destroying
28:18
that's what's in hell right now that's
28:20
what that's how the satan operates he
28:22
comes to kill steal destroyed you can
28:24
see that that is what's going on your
28:27
right because those people are agreeing
28:29
with that but they're not god and he's
28:31
about to show you they're not god and
28:34
yes he's got people selected for certain
28:36
positions and new creations coming that
28:38
he's not willing to let the enemy have
28:40
them so if you think it's all over on
28:42
this earth you don't know you don't know
28:44
what you're thinking okay you're hearing
28:46
words spoken to you and thoughts spoken
28:48
to you it says take every thought
28:50
captive that rises up against god
28:52
himself so if you have thoughts negative
28:55
to what's being said right now that is
28:58
not god that is the enemy trying to
29:00
trying to get you off your path to steal
29:03
your destiny and your joy and i can tell
29:06
you right now it is going to happen what
29:08
god has said yeah
29:10
well you know i'm convinced you know
29:12
they've been during this year whatever
29:14
november summer january march we're
29:16
about a year and five months almost one
29:17
and a half years
29:19
uh but there were times spent every few
29:22
weeks after the election i'd start to
29:24
sink and then i would encourage myself
29:26
and the lord i would listen to one of my
29:28
guests very closely and i got to the
29:31
point uh i think i think something
29:34
happened johnny and always kind of he
29:36
said
29:37
i want to go into the details but he
29:39
said be sure careful who you're
29:40
listening he wasn't talking about my
29:41
guests he was talking about people that
29:42
were talking from the outside because it
29:45
will affect you and i said
29:47
and i said johnny there's a part of me
29:48
that you don't know yet and that's the
29:50
part where a
29:51
familiar old friend rises up it's like i
29:55
just call it a backbone but this thing
29:57
happened and the worse it got the
29:59
stronger my backbone got and i finally
30:01
got to the point and this happens to me
30:02
in other places in life where that
30:05
backbone becomes so strong you can't you
30:07
could knock me down for an hour but then
30:09
i'm back up i'm back up you know
30:12
uh so it's it's interesting but uh he
30:14
was trying to keep me from falling he
30:16
didn't he didn't realize how strong god
30:19
of a backbone god put in me and it's
30:21
like that's right it would be like an
30:22
anti-bully spirit that i was born with
30:25
you know
30:26
yeah
30:26
so anyway that's that but well listen
30:29
listen we got a couple questions uh a
30:31
number of questions we got some time
30:32
left here so
30:33
i'm going to just read this one that's a
30:35
little longer than the normal question
30:37
but it says canada's reference is lynn
30:40
kent has reference in the past that the
30:41
father has a magnificent boardroom and
30:44
he loves to plan at the time of creation
30:47
when the word
30:49
jesus spoke and it was so had everything
30:51
been
30:52
meticulously planned before being spoken
30:55
or when creation was spoken
30:58
did their all-knowing power just make it
31:00
be
31:01
down to the minuscule degree so this is
31:04
trying to get a handle on what happened
31:06
after they said did they speak speaking
31:09
it was all done or did they go around
31:11
creating things i guess that's kind of
31:13
that's my interpretation of that that
31:16
could have different answers to that
31:19
question because
31:20
i don't know because i'm a detailed
31:23
person i don't know if they're talking
31:25
about at the time of the original
31:28
creation of the physical realm
31:30
or are they talking of time between that
31:33
time are they talking about right now
31:35
uh that's a loaded that's like a loaded
31:38
question well you know i think what i
31:40
think she's saying
31:42
is he's talking about what most
31:44
christians are taught when in the
31:45
beginning so we're talking about after
31:48
the fall and after that junk then god
31:52
saw the earth without form and void and
31:54
then he says let there be light and i
31:56
think that what she's saying is at that
31:58
point when he said let there be lied and
32:00
then let there be all these things did
32:02
they just pop up because they had been
32:04
meticulously planned and
32:06
one word made all these details suddenly
32:09
disappear i think that's what she's
32:10
asking but go ahead however you feel to
32:12
answer that they actually created by by
32:16
not just speaking once okay
32:19
uh they would go where there was nothing
32:21
and the word who was with god and in god
32:26
the father would say what he wanted
32:28
and the word which is why his name was
32:30
the word would step out and create the
32:32
words he would create those words that's
32:34
what he did he didn't just make anything
32:37
anywhere whenever the father said he
32:39
would step out of him of course they
32:41
lived separately i mean they didn't have
32:43
to stay inside but when they were going
32:44
to create they were mostly together when
32:47
they did that i'm not saying that the
32:49
word himself couldn't speak and make
32:51
things but god laid out a lot of plans
32:54
he laid out plans but he didn't make
32:56
every person choose what they wanted or
32:58
not wanted that was up to man in other
33:01
words this is god's plan
33:03
if you agree to go with this plan then a
33:05
lot of those things that he saw or
33:07
thought of you would happen sometimes
33:09
you yourself would delay things by the
33:11
word you speak yourself or against
33:13
yourself but as far as creation creation
33:16
uh uh the
33:18
life has always existed okay the father
33:20
has always existed the word has always
33:23
existed holy spirit has always existed
33:25
the four living greeks have always
33:27
melchized they weren't just like popped
33:29
up somewhere they were always with them
33:32
there was more than just them but who is
33:34
god who's the godhead father son and
33:37
holy spirit back then it was father word
33:39
and holy spirit but between them
33:42
everything was made that was made and it
33:44
was done by speaking first god would
33:47
think what do i want uh what do i want
33:49
to do here and then he was speaking the
33:51
word stepped out and made exactly what
33:53
he had said
33:54
that's how they operated they went
33:56
everywhere they went they went in time
33:58
out of time they went where they were at
34:01
that moment and wherever they went and
34:03
spoke it that did happen this won't
34:06
happen
34:07
um and that's how they created their
34:09
soul lined up with the words and the
34:12
desire they had their actions lined up
34:14
with those words and by the way you're
34:16
never going to get to create anything or
34:18
inventing if you don't operate the same
34:20
way i was in the mountains in north
34:22
carolina the father said i'm going to
34:23
show you how we created so it's really
34:25
wonderful that they even brought that
34:27
question up wow
34:28
you when you begin to create
34:31
uh and we will one day not people but we
34:34
will be creators because we're the sons
34:36
and daughters of the creators and so we
34:40
will our soul will have to line up if we
34:42
have a thought of something why and we
34:43
we cry from our soul this is what you
34:45
desire but your actions never line up by
34:48
what you're saying like i want to move
34:50
on a new place but you never do anything
34:52
to show that that's what you really want
34:54
you ignore it you set it but you do
34:55
nothing about it it won't become
34:57
anything
34:59
that's so important that's really you
35:00
build yourself up in most holy faith by
35:03
praying in tongues but you also have to
35:05
begin to believe that what you declare
35:08
will come to pass and then your actions
35:10
line up like you may start making plans
35:12
for something that you yourself desire
35:14
to do a desire to have that's in line
35:16
with god not caring if you have it if
35:19
you never do anything about it then
35:21
you're not going to have it
35:22
so if the father sincerely wanted
35:24
something it actually says in the bible
35:26
he would
35:27
speak and it would be created if he
35:30
liked it it remained
35:32
if he didn't like what he saw when it
35:34
was created then it didn't remain so
35:36
just so you all know it's not like he
35:38
practiced but he would start saying that
35:40
until he got what he wanted to look
35:42
exactly like what he said
35:44
and then it remained
35:46
interesting
35:48
even they had a way they did things but
35:50
they didn't just stand somewhere and say
35:52
one word and it all happened no they
35:53
went everywhere together and created all
35:57
these different things uh but the spirit
36:00
realm has always existed we're in the
36:02
temporary realm we're in the physical
36:04
realm so we can have these physical
36:06
bodies but the eternal realm is the
36:09
spirit realm and that's the unseen round
36:12
to you if you died you see all of it
36:14
okay if god allows you now you can see
36:16
the spirit realm but that is the actual
36:18
main realm that exists is the spirit
36:21
realm and in that realm where that
36:24
nothing is seen by man everything he
36:26
made was in the unseen realm and then
36:28
put in the scene realm and you have to
36:31
understand you're a triune being they're
36:33
triune beings but you have to begin to
36:36
line up with the way god speaks and says
36:38
things if you can't see him for who he
36:41
is you will never know who you are so
36:44
yes they went all over the place in a
36:47
place where there is no time and began
36:49
to create and make things and set things
36:52
in
36:52
place okay good good good all right
36:56
that's really good cat um okay so this
36:58
uh
36:59
k warrior warrior i can't see the last
37:02
name when angels are sent on a task from
37:05
heaven
37:06
does satan know that these angels were
37:08
sent if so does he try to stop the angel
37:10
from carrying out their task and how are
37:12
these angels protected if they need
37:14
protection
37:16
that's another loaded question
37:19
are you talking about the ones under
37:20
gabriel you're talking about the ones
37:23
most most of us don't know which are
37:25
under gabriel you know we just say
37:27
angels but so you you you know the
37:30
difference you know gabriel has his own
37:33
a set of angels is that right and yes
37:36
absolutely gabriel gabriel is over
37:38
one-third of the angels that would be
37:40
the couriers the scribes um the
37:43
messenger angels uh those who bring body
37:45
parts down from heaven uh they'll their
37:48
scribes they'll come record things and
37:50
take them back to the father they'll
37:51
bring messages from him so when they go
37:54
somewhere if those angels are sent
37:57
angels are sent on assignment under
37:58
gabriel they always have members of the
38:01
army called the host the army's called
38:04
the host all of the hosts all the army
38:07
is under michael okay he is the captain
38:10
of the host jesus is the lord of hosts
38:12
because he's over all of them
38:14
but but michael when michael goes
38:16
somewhere now if michael shows up the
38:18
devil's going to be in trouble so
38:20
usually when when guardian not your
38:23
guardian angel by the way is under it's
38:25
under um it's under gabriel your
38:28
guardian angel is not a member of the
38:30
host they're not that's why many many of
38:33
them gabriels look like humans with
38:35
wings or they hide their wings almost
38:39
none of the army look like humans
38:42
they're mainly look like creatures or
38:43
part creature par part well you would
38:45
call creature and part human but they're
38:47
just the way god made them yeah and so
38:49
but they travel they travel in groups
38:52
like a host would never come excuse me
38:55
just excuse me
38:56
i'm excited
38:58
well you know and uh yeah i don't want
39:00
to mess up go ahead so whenever any of
39:02
gabriels are sent to the earth with a
39:04
message i mean they've been sent to me i
39:06
mean god just has ways he does things
39:08
i've had messenger angels sent to me by
39:11
god and there were always two of the
39:13
hosts with them to protect them
39:16
most of the hosts don't need protection
39:18
when they travel on assignment
39:20
and if if we're commanding them they
39:23
have right to go into enemy territory
39:25
and take things back because we have
39:27
authority and power over the enemy so
39:29
this is a really loaded question but
39:32
when michael comes and michael brings
39:34
the army
39:36
they're not going to have many issues
39:38
they'll be attacking the demonic army
39:40
they're coming to attack the demonic
39:42
army uh but when i i've seen like scouts
39:45
are sent out around to the atmosphere
39:47
here and they watch activities of humans
39:50
that are doing things wrong
39:52
and they always have army members
39:54
heaven's army members with them so if
39:56
it's part of gabriel's group coming no
39:58
matter what it's for they always will
39:59
have part of the army with them and you
40:02
all know
40:03
you know daniel was waiting on the
40:05
answer to his prayer and the angel
40:07
finally came he said well i came but i
40:09
was stopped he was stopped by part of
40:11
the army of darkness but then michael
40:13
showed up okay when michael showed up
40:15
that whole thing was all over and
40:17
therefore the messenger was able to come
40:18
and bring the answer so you can see
40:21
places in the bible actually the
40:22
protocol they have with all that
40:25
so most gabriels come on their scent
40:28
even over the earth or from heaven to
40:30
earth they're always going to have part
40:33
of the army of heaven the army is called
40:34
the hosts yeah
40:37
and now this and and the other part of
40:39
this question is and maybe let's talk
40:41
about this for a minute because we talk
40:43
about the devil this and we we cast the
40:45
devil out but he is not
40:48
omnipresent he can't be everywhere once
40:51
he i think he has to do one thing at a
40:53
time or give him one command at a time
40:54
so when she says does it does satan know
40:57
if angel's been sent on an assignment he
41:00
may know
41:02
he knew something was going on with
41:03
daniel but right now there's 7.5 billion
41:06
people on the face of the earth he
41:08
probably knows very few things compared
41:10
to the things
41:12
god is doing right how would you
41:13
describe when whether we re just satan
41:16
or whether we're resisting the demons he
41:18
sent or is that all the same
41:20
[Laughter]
41:22
complicated questions a lot of questions
41:24
uh if you understand how that operates
41:27
it helps you to answer a lot of the to
41:29
have answers to the questions okay
41:32
there's great daughters there's darkness
41:33
on the earth right now it's not the
41:35
great great darkness by the way because
41:36
i've seen those times in the future so i
41:39
know what you you may think it's the end
41:41
but it's not the end just so you know
41:42
that
41:44
but we by jesus christ
41:46
has been given power over all the power
41:48
of the enemy that means any of them any
41:50
of them but but when you ignore them or
41:53
you pretend like they're not around or
41:55
you're living a life
41:57
that is filled with unrighteousness you
41:59
decide to sin a lot and stuff like that
42:00
you're actually going to attract the
42:02
enemy to you because they know you're a
42:03
believer but you're sinning you're going
42:05
to be a target and and some people are
42:08
more dangerous against hell than others
42:10
so they will be watched more they'll
42:12
have uh they'll have like scouts from
42:14
hell watching you but if you have enough
42:17
army around you they'll they'll beat
42:19
them up and get them get them out of the
42:20
way away from you so they do have a
42:23
protocol how they operate
42:24
but hell knows when someone's been sent
42:27
when they're when they begin to fail in
42:30
their attempts of what their plans are
42:32
they make plans too they make plans like
42:34
to affect different places in the earth
42:36
or if they're going after certain
42:38
specific areas in the earth like they
42:40
may try to get the ukraine right now or
42:43
afghanistan
42:44
and when you see these things when you
42:46
see war or destruction happening hell is
42:48
always involved they made plans for that
42:51
to happen they sent evil wicked beings
42:54
out to get these other people to be
42:55
wicked and evil to bring war or hate
42:58
people uh that's all operated by hell
43:01
and so our the army of god is always on
43:03
the ready when the father sends them
43:05
where the lord sends them but it's a
43:07
different time for us now for us as
43:09
believers to command the army of heaven
43:12
and if you are it's going to be really
43:15
hard for the
43:16
any demon or the even the enemy to try
43:18
to get in to attack you
43:20
so i can i can just say this hell knows
43:23
when something is going down because
43:25
they see activity in the spirit realm
43:28
unless even that can be covert even the
43:30
way they come into the earth
43:32
the father can hide the host coming into
43:34
the earth the enemy's not aware and then
43:37
all of a sudden there's a
43:38
bushwhack and he's had all things set up
43:41
like all the stuff's going to start
43:42
happening and wickedness and all of a
43:44
sudden his guys start getting taken out
43:47
i mean the hosts are appearing they're
43:49
battling their warring against the the
43:51
plans of
43:52
of hell and satan and they've already
43:54
lost that battle before it began in the
43:57
natural realm they have lost it in the
43:59
spirit realm so i can tell you they know
44:02
when people are saying things you know
44:03
what hell's afraid of your word saying
44:07
that you are above and not beneath that
44:10
you have a dominion over him that you
44:12
belong to the father he's got plans and
44:14
you are for his plans
44:16
regardless of what's going on when you
44:18
begin to say i choose to believe god he
44:21
knows what's happening i'm a part of
44:23
what god is doing i'm not taking
44:24
anything you know of the enemy i serve
44:27
the living god that terrifies hell you
44:30
terrify them and you're never going to
44:31
heard them say that to you but they
44:33
realize they're not getting you they're
44:36
not getting your attention they're not
44:37
getting the reaction they want they want
44:39
fearing you they know when they're doing
44:41
a good job when people start getting
44:43
afraid or or they begin to attack one
44:45
another or you know bash people with
44:47
their mouth then what hell's planning is
44:49
being effective the way that satan knows
44:52
his plans are working is by what you
44:54
respond yourself in your life every day
44:57
what you're saying what your choices are
44:59
that's the only way they know that
45:01
they're getting your attention or
45:03
they're using you when you begin to
45:06
praise god under people saying the best
45:07
praise god praise him by saying who he
45:10
is and who you are belonging to him
45:13
and so when the people when people begin
45:14
to understand no matter what's going on
45:17
in this physical realm when you stay
45:20
your course and say who god is and
45:22
you're trusting and believing him those
45:24
demons will not want to be assigned to
45:27
you why because they're not going to be
45:28
productive they're wasting their time
45:31
and know satan does not know everything
45:33
he doesn't know everything everywhere
45:35
that's why he has he sends scouts out he
45:37
signs up demons some he won't waste on
45:40
people if he already knows that they're
45:41
powerful in god he's going to find
45:43
people who are weaker that he can get to
45:45
hate each other or kill people or or go
45:47
along with the lies that are being given
45:49
a lot of deception is in the earth
45:50
that's one of the biggest things that
45:52
satan is using right now it used to be
45:54
fear numbness deception
45:56
and so make sure you're not listening to
45:58
the wrong words or agreeing with those
46:00
wrong words make sure you stay your
46:02
course and you agree with what god is
46:04
saying in his time this is god's time
46:07
it's not hell's time
46:09
and so yes the enemy only knows you
46:11
successful by what you say
46:14
if you say the opposite of what the line
46:16
cheating people are saying if you for
46:19
life if you're for justice if you're for
46:21
liberty and freedom they are failing
46:24
all day long on their attempt to try to
46:26
get you to believe a lie then they will
46:30
be withdrawn and they will be sent
46:32
somewhere else but no he satan has a lot
46:34
of couriers himself and sometimes they
46:37
fight each other because they don't want
46:39
to be blamed for failing on the mission
46:41
they were sent against so hell is not
46:44
nearly as organized as heaven is
46:46
obviously yeah if you even get in line
46:48
with what god is saying and understand
46:51
that what you say can bring a life to
46:54
people and hope to people you're not
46:56
supposed to bring fear by agreeing with
46:58
all the stuff that's going on uh
47:00
whatsoever you think or
47:02
are in your heart that's what you're
47:03
going to be
47:05
satan knows he's failing when he
47:07
continues words of hope and power and
47:09
dominion from you he knows he's failing
47:12
miserably yeah now cat
47:15
just to recap for some that there's
47:17
always new people every every day every
47:19
year so
47:21
i
47:21
you talked about we're in a different
47:23
time now and i'm going to just say it
47:24
the way i understand it somewhere
47:26
between 2012 and 2014 god came and
47:30
introduced the host initiative to you
47:32
i'm guessing he did this with other
47:34
people on the earth i don't know that he
47:35
did but but you know he came to you
47:38
so when you say we're at a different
47:40
time are you referring to
47:42
the kingdom age that you said
47:44
we started operating in in 2012 or are
47:46
you saying
47:47
when the host initiative was introduced
47:49
where we began to be trained to fight or
47:52
to to send our own hosts or all of the
47:54
above what just
47:55
and in 2012 really is what kicked the
47:58
whole thing off and i do know
48:00
as as a prophet of god and a revelator
48:04
that we can feel things coming we can
48:06
feel moves of god coming and even talk
48:08
about them that's what a prophet does
48:10
they'll talk about things before they
48:12
happen
48:13
i begin to feel um
48:15
i say this way i didn't feel impending
48:18
doom in any way ever okay because i
48:20
don't agree with doom i don't agree with
48:23
gloom or fear uh the only one who's
48:26
gonna fail so miserably he'll wish he
48:27
never made an attempt to do anything
48:29
that would be hell that would be satan
48:31
they're they're gonna fail let's just
48:32
push us button
48:33
[Music]
48:36
that's now this is what
48:38
that's what hell is going through right
48:40
now you know i mean god's pushing his
48:42
fail button up there and everything
48:44
they're doing that you can't see right
48:46
now they're failing miserably because
48:49
they're afraid
48:50
right now more people in the body have
48:52
are coming together and powerful things
48:54
are happening in meetings outside of
48:57
meetings hell doesn't want to see that
48:59
they don't want to hear that report and
49:00
that's why the news the natural earth
49:03
news won't report it because then you
49:05
will understand that a lot of the plans
49:08
that persons sitting illegally illegally
49:11
in the white house
49:13
they're failing at what they want to see
49:15
have have done and if you think god is
49:18
about to have the life taken he set
49:21
himself their time their birth on the
49:23
earth have them taken right before they
49:25
come then you are very wrong i think
49:28
some things are about to happen in these
49:30
places where they do that babies i think
49:32
terror is going to start falling on the
49:34
people the terror of god is an actual
49:36
thing that's not you being afraid of god
49:38
that's terror coming out terror of god
49:40
coming on people who are wicked and evil
49:43
that he is putting there letting them
49:45
know you better not go there you better
49:48
not be a part of that and so i think
49:51
this world is going to get a really big
49:52
taste of the father son and holy spirit
49:54
more than they ever have before
49:56
um so i i want you to know that you need
49:59
to trust him if he's for you and not
50:02
against you why would he want the earth
50:04
destroyed if he made the earth for his
50:06
own purposes to send us from him so you
50:09
would have this physical body and not
50:11
just a spiritual body and he gave you a
50:14
destiny and a call and anointed you for
50:16
this time why would he let you fail he
50:19
isn't he's not going to let you fail so
50:22
i know i probably went beyond all that
50:24
but no no that's good right here the
50:26
holy spirit is telling me say this say
50:28
to say this right while i'm speaking
50:30
because he wants to encourage and
50:32
empower you it's nice to be inspired you
50:35
need to be empowered
50:37
that's good and and uh
50:40
can i just play a little elementary
50:42
school here for this because it's nice
50:43
to be inspired we're being inspired
50:45
today
50:46
if someone's sitting there going okay
50:48
cat just said i need to be empowered how
50:50
am i if someone's watching right now and
50:52
they're going what what what do i do
50:53
what does that mean can you you just
50:56
jump off on that one and tell people how
50:58
do they get empowered because i know you
51:00
know what it means
51:01
yeah and power is taking you to an a
51:04
whole new place in god is you're finally
51:07
going to step out and begin to
51:09
understand how wonderfully and perfectly
51:11
you were made that god does have a
51:13
purpose for you or he would not have
51:15
sent you from himself during this time
51:18
you need to believe what the word says
51:20
believe what the bible says and uh if
51:22
you just look up the some of the normal
51:24
promises that people would say normal
51:26
promises that he meant for us to rule
51:29
and reign with with christ now in this
51:31
life and in the times to come you're
51:34
sent here to rule to be over to not be
51:36
under you were sent here to speak into
51:39
the earth itself uh that's who you are
51:42
you're a son or daughter of god not
51:44
something in between by the way
51:46
you're one or the other and you're who
51:48
god made you to be and so when you get
51:51
off that track and begin to look well
51:52
will i find god in this religion will it
51:54
find him in his false religion will this
51:56
one help me
51:57
i'm talking about the one who made
51:59
everything who lives in heaven who sits
52:02
on the throne with his son next to him
52:04
you have to believe just the basics and
52:06
begin to understand this is real this is
52:09
all real that's happening and you want
52:12
to know him more i would say the most
52:14
important thing is even say i want to
52:15
know you more you say that to him
52:17
yourself i tell people you don't have to
52:19
get in a position you don't have to have
52:21
to be in a church to do that get in a
52:23
room and shut the door and say i want to
52:25
know you more i need to know you i need
52:27
to know your ways i need to know your
52:29
thoughts i want them
52:31
show me yourself show yourself to me let
52:34
me feel your presence so i know that
52:36
you're here and i'm telling you i did
52:38
that every day i can't tell you how long
52:39
i did this was like 20 30 years ago and
52:42
then he began to show up and i mean no i
52:44
didn't need to know anything to tell me
52:46
that it was him that it was the son of
52:48
the living god or it was holy spirit or
52:50
even the father would show up you know
52:52
what because i want what they want i'm
52:56
totally against evil wickedness against
52:58
hell uh satan is your enemy he's
53:01
everybody's enemy he's the left enemy
53:03
he's the right enemy he's a conservative
53:05
it doesn't matter who's on the earth the
53:07
enemy of every human on this earth is
53:09
satan who either use you try to wipe you
53:12
out and yet here's god who made you and
53:15
has a purpose for you in this earth you
53:17
need to know him so you know who you are
53:20
because man sometimes it doesn't even
53:22
know who you are the pastor's come down
53:24
and doesn't know who you are and
53:26
probably would even disagree with the
53:28
very words i'm speaking although they're
53:30
in his word
53:31
it says man shall not put my bread alone
53:34
that's the written word but by every
53:36
word spoken by the mouth of god so yes
53:39
he does say things that don't go against
53:41
his word so that you'll know who you are
53:44
what's going on in this time what's
53:45
really happening that's why he has
53:48
prophets
53:49
yeah
53:50
you know i always write and can for
53:52
those of you that maybe you were you're
53:53
just new and you were raised in oh just
53:56
a normal baptist methodist whatever the
53:58
church would be but the generalized
54:00
teaching was once the bible was codified
54:03
in 307 a.d
54:05
god
54:06
decided okay i guess i'm not talking
54:08
anymore that's they don't teach it quite
54:10
like that but that's the effect they say
54:12
it's in the bible now if it's not in
54:13
here you can't have anything to do with
54:15
it so god's going okay so i guess i'm
54:18
supposed to not touch anything and to
54:20
say anything
54:22
and god won't be kept in a box but it's
54:24
fun for a while until you realize
54:25
there's really no power that's why
54:27
masses of those denominations went out
54:29
and found
54:30
god you know
54:33
not just incarnate but god
54:35
powerful you know anyway uh we could
54:37
talk about that for a long time but um
54:39
yeah okay i won't get too far but let me
54:41
get another question here um
54:45
here's a question about heaven cat do
54:46
people plant seeds ann is asking in
54:49
heaven to grow things on earth we have
54:51
seed time and harvest but there's no is
54:54
there if there's no time in heaven i
54:56
wondered how it works and how do people
54:57
plant seeds or you just go flowers bee
55:00
or what what would happen if you're
55:01
gifted to be a farmer you would totally
55:03
plant seeds but they come up immediately
55:06
okay
55:10
you said the key word there is no time
55:12
so you don't wait
55:14
you don't wait for them to say it that's
55:17
the creating part i talked about and
55:19
heaven will uh you'll have seeds and you
55:22
plant what you want but your flowers are
55:24
going to be like five foot tall they'll
55:25
be talking or they'll be singing you can
55:28
make hotels and melons and arrangements
55:30
so that's why one question can go into
55:32
all that oh so yeah
55:34
they'll even they'll even kill the
55:36
ground of heaven because they like it
55:38
they don't have to farmers there's huge
55:41
farmers farms all over in heaven and
55:43
people love to go visit them maybe you
55:45
don't want to be a farmer you don't have
55:47
to be one but if that's what they were
55:48
called to be in there some people
55:50
anointed to be farmers you know or they
55:52
build cars they design things they they
55:54
create music uh you have a gift
55:57
sometimes it's the culinary arts heaven
56:00
totally agrees with the culinary arts in
56:02
heaven
56:03
and so whatever that gift you are if
56:06
it's the thing you're passionate you
56:07
talk about all the time think about it
56:08
all the time in heaven that's what you
56:10
will be
56:11
so even if you never got to be a chef or
56:13
have a restaurant or do something great
56:15
with that but you make the best barbecue
56:18
ever on the face of the earth you're
56:19
probably going to have a restaurant well
56:21
you'll have barbecue
56:23
things are done rapidly you don't have
56:25
to wait you are that gift you come to
56:27
heaven he's put everything on your
56:29
mansion you need to be that gift so
56:31
farmers already have a lot of land
56:33
sometimes even the angels have tilled
56:35
the ground for you and then you decide
56:37
what are you going to plant you go then
56:38
plant it and then you turn around and
56:39
it's there and then you harvest it and
56:41
you make arrangements or you do stuff
56:43
with wheat
56:44
it's magnificent it's it's way beyond
56:47
your life here
56:48
i get confused from time to time because
56:51
you
56:52
you have clarified that
56:55
your gift isn't necessarily what you do
56:57
but i've discovered that sometimes
56:59
people's hobbies are what their gifts
57:01
are they'll do that and have it
57:02
sometimes people what they do farming
57:05
is a is what they do but you're saying
57:07
that's their gift and someone wrote
57:09
today on my list here and they said i'm
57:10
an accountant and i love accounting
57:14
what do i do and have it
57:16
i'm sure you won't be counting numbers
57:19
no or will not
57:21
nobody has bank accounts in heaven you
57:23
don't have finances you don't have
57:24
stocks to exchange like that
57:27
you have wealth in many different ways
57:28
in heaven but you're not going to be
57:30
counting that if you like to count
57:32
things i'm sure he's got many things up
57:35
there he's meaning for you to count and
57:37
write it down i will say this god does
57:39
love to write things down he's the
57:41
writer jesus is the speaker jesus never
57:44
liked writing in school and he always
57:46
has this joke that that's why there's
57:48
only 10 commandments and not 20.
57:51
he didn't want to have to write 20 down
57:53
on this stone so we put 10. but the
57:56
father loves to write and he likes to
57:58
record and put things down so if you
58:00
love that and that is a gift that it's
58:02
your passion
58:04
if it's your gift it's something you
58:05
will love it's not going to be a dredge
58:07
a burden it's probably not what you're
58:09
doing for a living
58:10
on earth you have to make a living to
58:12
exist but in heaven you exist to live
58:16
and this one with accounting she's made
58:18
the point that she loves loves loves our
58:20
accounting so you're saying you god will
58:22
let give you many things to
58:24
write down and take it make it yeah
58:28
if it's him or whatever that whatever
58:29
they are he absolutely will put them in
58:31
charge of some place in heaven and they
58:33
may count all kinds of different things
58:36
and keep track of that and even report
58:38
to him with what they've got it's not
58:40
like he doesn't know but because that's
58:42
their passion and he wants them to use
58:44
that gift um most accountants i think
58:47
will probably be playing golf or uh
58:49
we're going into car shows or something
58:52
like we said like steve said the job you
58:54
have now if you if you don't like it
58:56
you're not happy with it that's
58:57
definitely not your gift
58:59
if you're if you're blessed enough to
59:01
the gift he made you i am a photographer
59:04
okay in heaven i'm not going to be a
59:06
revelator he won't need me to reveal
59:08
heaven you'll be living there but my
59:11
gift i was sent to the earth with is a
59:13
photographer it is my passion every time
59:16
i look at something i wish i had my
59:18
camera i could take that i could create
59:20
something i create moments in time with
59:22
my camera it's my passion it's what i
59:24
want to do all the time but i had to lay
59:26
that down as far as a business would go
59:29
to do
59:30
to do this for him but in heaven i'll be
59:32
a photographer i'll have my own studio
59:34
come by and see me i won't charge you
59:35
anything
59:37
that's good
59:38
um okay so can i uh can we ask this is
59:41
tammy can can we ask our angels to help
59:44
us in our daily life with physical help
59:46
that is needed for example to move
59:48
something that's too heavy for us i
59:50
don't know
59:51
i mean okay you'd have to be in a
59:53
different realm to have an angel lift
59:55
something for you so how would you
59:57
respond to that
59:58
i think that is something that has come
60:00
i just have to say the truth that is
60:02
coming it is
60:04
okay but you have to be
60:06
uh
60:07
knowing christ is the beginning
60:09
receiving christ is just the beginning
60:11
of your life
60:13
it's just the beginning you need to
60:15
pursue him to know him himself more than
60:18
anything else it says when you seek for
60:20
me with all my heart you will find me
60:23
when that happens you again and it
60:25
really comes from a desire to know him
60:27
to be with him and and and he'll open
60:30
doors that were never open for you
60:32
before but this whole thing about moving
60:33
things going in and out of the spirit
60:35
realm uh if at one point the bible says
60:39
one person will speak to a mountain and
60:41
demand it to go into the sea and it will
60:43
not will be up
60:44
rooted it will go and see that shows you
60:46
right there there's coming times on the
60:48
earth well yes that will happen
60:50
i'm not saying you can run out there and
60:52
practice and hope something doesn't fall
60:53
on you that's not what i'm telling you
60:55
to do don't jump off of a building to
60:57
see if you can fly yet uh usually god
61:01
himself will introduce these things to
61:03
you but but the more your faith is built
61:06
that's why it's important and i think
61:08
things at one point on the earth will be
61:10
so fantastic and amazing and great
61:13
people will maybe i'm not saying now
61:15
even i'm not talking about even 100
61:16
years from now i'm saying even beyond
61:18
that that the earth will be so different
61:20
and uh war will be little at some time a
61:24
lot of things will be so available to
61:26
people at one time
61:28
that people probably won't need to use
61:29
their faith as much okay don't ever stop
61:32
using the faith he gave you and letting
61:34
it grow because then you you at one
61:37
point be depending on what you can do
61:39
yourself for you i'm talking about
61:41
supernatural feats i am talking about
61:44
that
61:45
and uh so it's going to come at one
61:47
point on the earth we're just now
61:49
stepping into a realm of knowing that we
61:52
ourselves are supernatural people if
61:54
you're born again you're not normal and
61:56
there should be things not normal about
61:58
you the way i speak is not normal but
62:00
actually this is normal in heaven to be
62:02
the way that i am it's called heaven
62:05
culture so that was not uh really an
62:08
unusual question
62:10
yeah and and
62:11
in church history they actually have
62:13
recorded that there were times and i
62:15
think some of them were children they
62:17
would end up
62:18
rising above we don't use the word
62:19
levitate that we're levitating like the
62:22
enemy tried to do something but there
62:24
were some
62:25
who found themselves a few inches off
62:29
off the ground and do i understand that
62:30
that has happened to you before
62:32
yes i walked down there
62:35
okay do you want to say any more about
62:37
it
62:38
i want to say one thing i want to say
62:40
one thing first i'm talking about the
62:42
celtic saints people i'm not talking
62:44
about people i'm not talking about the
62:46
druids and i'm not stop always bringing
62:48
helen that you're like they're the ones
62:50
who only did supernatural things
62:52
uh but even back in the day when they
62:54
when the druids and all these people i'd
62:56
say this is probably what 300 years you
62:58
know from the birth from the
63:01
birth of christ or something like that
63:03
or or maybe the death of christ i'm not
63:05
quite sure about human dates i don't do
63:08
well with human beings i just know god's
63:09
timeline okay back in the day
63:12
i guess probably in the dark ages what
63:14
they call the dark ages when so much
63:16
witchcraft abounded and warlocks and
63:18
wickedness and evil by the way those
63:20
those things are still around even today
63:22
uh and they're going to try to make
63:23
themselves look good eventually that's
63:25
just a free tip for everybody that's
63:27
that's coming too but god did
63:30
supernatural acts in those days with
63:32
people and the celtic people i'm talking
63:35
about ireland scotland
63:37
well the welsh people had so many
63:40
supernatural things going on
63:42
there was an island where some of them
63:45
lived and they would this is this is
63:46
their own statement recorded there's
63:48
like 2 000 step tower that you have to
63:51
go up to i don't think you could make
63:53
yourself up there would you however they
63:55
did in days and when their face was
63:56
great and the statement for the people
63:59
who still keep those places where the
64:01
celtic saints lived like colombo
64:03
patrick and those people who did know
64:06
god and loved god and they were in the
64:08
company of angels many times and they
64:10
did supernatural things like just go out
64:12
to sea and there was no steering the
64:14
boats and don't go do that yourself
64:15
because i said that i always have to
64:17
make sure people want to throw the stuff
64:19
out there and do it now no people will
64:21
be rescued you don't want to do that but
64:23
i'm telling you the way it was back
64:24
before
64:26
those things were beginning to happen
64:28
again but in this place um i think
64:32
possibly people be looking now in the
64:34
one star wars movie they actually
64:36
usually replace i think where those
64:38
things happen some of these things
64:39
happen
64:40
yeah an angel some angels were assigned
64:43
to help the people who kept those places
64:45
we're talking about hundreds of years
64:46
ago
64:47
and they would say
64:49
they had statements like well the steps
64:51
were very hard but god would give us the
64:53
strength to go up there unless we had a
64:55
good day and we didn't have to walk
64:58
we went to the top
65:02
really that means yes they went
65:04
themselves and they had enough faith to
65:06
bleed to go up there
65:08
so if you think you don't need faith you
65:10
better hang on to faith and you better
65:11
start building that faith because there
65:13
will be supernatural acts it talks about
65:16
the signs and wonders in the bible never
65:17
seen before those things are going to
65:20
happen on this earth that's why jesus
65:22
isn't coming to rescue you right now he
65:24
wants you to get your crown on which pen
65:27
i'm actually wearing that says get your
65:28
crown on because we have to rule in this
65:31
earth and declare things in the spirit
65:33
realm as kings as priests and see things
65:36
immediately begin to happen in the
65:38
natural realm it starts in the spiritual
65:40
realm
65:42
and then it comes down and in then it
65:44
will be manifested in this physical
65:45
realm but there were people back in
65:47
those days that did supernatural things
65:50
all the time because their faith was
65:51
great because they were hearing god and
65:54
there's so much activity around you and
65:56
choices around you
65:58
how much time are you going to give god
66:00
for you to just hear him because i know
66:02
he never has stopped speaking yeah
66:07
did you did unless you said it really
66:09
fast did you talk about what happened to
66:11
you where you found yourself with some
66:12
air
66:13
did you see yeah no and jen was my
66:16
witness when it happened so i have
66:18
witnesses that saw me walk here i i go
66:21
to reno every year and speak at this
66:23
wonderful place and um we we had a ride
66:26
but the week before is the most
66:28
important part of this the week before
66:30
and this is what i mean about you
66:32
passionately it says in the bible uh
66:34
from the time of john the baptist until
66:37
now the violent take it by force in
66:40
other words john the baptist also did
66:42
supernatural things he was a
66:44
supernatural person and his faith was
66:46
great
66:47
and so from that time of him believing
66:51
and trusting this is while he i think
66:53
even before he actually revealed that
66:55
jesus christ was the son of god he lived
66:58
in that place with god he walked in the
67:00
spirit that's the place i don't have
67:02
time to explain that right now to you
67:04
but he believed god in what god said he
67:07
did and and actually god has always said
67:10
you need to know my ways because if you
67:12
know his ways you're not going to be
67:13
making a lot of mistakes or wrong
67:15
choices all of this is always going to
67:17
be geared towards knowing what god wants
67:21
but i did learn that the more passionate
67:24
you are when you do clear things and
67:26
then your soul begins to accept that
67:28
this is what is wanted and then you make
67:31
it known you say in the spirit realm
67:33
things begin to happen to you to cause
67:36
that thing to happen so i felt about a
67:38
week before and i rarely fall
67:41
but i fell
67:42
and when i got up
67:44
i declared in the public this will never
67:48
happen to me again
67:50
and i was i was just making a statement
67:52
if the angels or the host have to bear
67:55
me up so my foot does not hit the ground
67:59
i will never fall again when i said that
68:02
something was written down in the spirit
68:04
realm that i said that in faith
68:08
fiercely said it that's the violent the
68:10
violence isn't like killing people it's
68:12
you passionately and fiercely declaring
68:14
things that you begin you know this is
68:16
what god this is what's going to happen
68:19
when god says command ye me what he's
68:21
actually saying is let me see you
68:22
command so i was putting a statement out
68:25
there like i will never fall again
68:28
no matter what has to happen i won't
68:30
fall one week later we are in reno
68:34
headed towards the green room i did not
68:37
notice
68:38
that there was like a foot and a half
68:40
drop that we had to step off on onto the
68:43
floor and continue on
68:45
i never stepped down i just kept walking
68:49
and jen is behind me and she starts
68:51
yelling you're floating on the air
68:54
and and i i've had my ipad in my hand
68:57
pastor in front of me and i said no i'm
68:59
not you know because we get you kid each
69:01
other sometimes she said no i'm serious
69:04
you are and i had walked like eight feet
69:06
out just out just walking out i couldn't
69:09
feel anything under me but i was just
69:11
going forward and and finally she goes
69:14
she says stop
69:16
and look down
69:17
you are walking on air
69:21
and when i look down
69:23
i was walking on the air had been
69:25
walking on air across this big space and
69:29
i was standing on air
69:31
there was no water but nothing beneath
69:33
my feet there was no club beneath my
69:35
feet i would i would have fallen on my
69:38
face
69:40
in the natural i would have stepped off
69:43
and i would have fallen flat on my face
69:45
and it was concrete it was like a stone
69:47
floor and i had my ipad in my hand and i
69:50
was so focused on sharing just the
69:52
things of god revelation with his
69:54
pastors walking in front of me
69:56
and all of a sudden they look down and
69:58
i'm i'm standing in air not touching it
70:01
and this is my first thought
70:03
wow is this what it was like for jesus
70:06
when he walked on water i mean that was
70:08
my first thought
70:09
and and i said no this is a greater work
70:13
jesus could feel the water under his
70:15
feet do you feel the air this is him
70:18
talking to me while i'm standing here
70:19
and i went
70:20
no i don't feel he said well get used to
70:23
it
70:24
and then i looked down again and i
70:26
didn't really actually hit me i was
70:28
saying and i went
70:31
and just really slowly slowly i went
70:34
down to the floor
70:36
yeah
70:37
and i began to shake and jen was shaking
70:39
by the time he got to the green room we
70:41
couldn't have stopped shaking and the
70:42
pastor goes what's wrong with you jen
70:44
goes she was walking on there and he
70:45
goes and i missed it can you do it again
70:48
for me
70:49
yeah it doesn't work it doesn't work
70:50
that way does it wow you know
70:53
you know i was a ch i was like
70:54
elementary school summer was showing me
70:57
us kids at school at christian school
70:59
but they somehow
71:01
there was an article about and they were
71:02
children who were preaching and they
71:05
were documented to have been in the air
71:07
when they were the anointing came on him
71:09
and this was in a very
71:11
you know fundamental type school it
71:13
wasn't like the kind that would normally
71:14
even teach that kind of thing so they
71:16
taught it
71:17
and i and i've never forgotten it so
71:19
when you're telling me i go yeah i've
71:20
heard that
71:22
i heard that so that i it's really easy
71:24
for me to believe i've known that since
71:25
the child now i've never felt it yet but
71:27
and you know we've all heard stories of
71:29
if
71:30
you know
71:31
i've heard many stories about people
71:32
saying you know they were it was
71:35
supposed to be a two-hour drive and all
71:36
of a sudden 20 minutes they're there
71:38
have you had that happen before yes i
71:40
have
71:41
yeah i totally have had that happen we
71:44
were like uh we had just started out on
71:46
a journey uh that would have been like
71:49
eight seven or eight hours and like two
71:51
hours later we were there
71:53
we just were pulled up you're traveling
71:55
in the spirit realm is what you're doing
71:57
you're being accelerated through the
71:58
spirit realm and what happens is it
72:00
looks normal outside you then all of a
72:02
sudden if you look up you notice you're
72:05
there i don't know any other way to
72:06
explain it i do know that that is what
72:09
has happened is that you're actually
72:10
entering into that spirit realm where
72:12
there's no time or space or distance
72:15
yeah and that's what jesus did it when
72:17
it said he stepped on the boat
72:19
and the vote was at its destination when
72:23
he stepped on that boat it was
72:24
accelerated in the spirit realm and
72:27
immediately they were there that is
72:29
going to start happening a lot more
72:31
often i also had heard people talk about
72:33
that many times but we have it seems
72:36
very unreal it seems very unreal but you
72:39
can't deny you can't deny that
72:43
i mean and from our human perspective we
72:45
want to we want to just we need to rest
72:47
fast but other than the fact that we
72:49
need rest there
72:52
was no spiritual reason to get there
72:53
fast he did it because he could i guess
72:56
god did it jesus did they did it he
72:58
steps under the boat from the water and
73:00
apparently it's there yeah
73:02
i think that uh jesus like anyone else
73:05
uh
73:06
he did learn those things probably from
73:09
his father he would go away to the
73:11
mountains to be with him and i'm quite
73:13
sure that uh when jesus was born as a
73:15
baby as a little tiny baby he didn't
73:17
really know who he was for a while but
73:19
while he was still young he did
73:22
begin to realize this is who i am and
73:24
that's when he he didn't get lost from
73:26
the caravan he on purpose stayed behind
73:28
the temple because the priests were
73:30
questioning one thing after another
73:32
here's this this young person who knows
73:34
things they didn't even understand how
73:36
he knew and yet that's when mary and
73:38
joseph came in and said how could you
73:39
how could you beat us or even he said i
73:41
must be about my father's business from
73:43
that time on he knew who he was and he
73:45
did begin to do
73:47
he did supernatural things that's not
73:49
necessarily recorded in the bible that's
73:50
how he knew to do them out in public
73:54
i guess doing him at home is not a
73:56
miracle but they called it a miracle
73:57
when he turned the water into wine i
73:59
know he did do that in his own home with
74:01
mary and his siblings he did do that i'm
74:04
going to ask you that and then this will
74:05
be our last one but
74:07
so
74:09
when he did his first public miracle
74:11
which was at the wedding at cana changes
74:14
water to wine but you're saying he
74:16
absolutely
74:18
from time to time would work miracles
74:20
when he was at home it wasn't the public
74:22
right
74:23
yeah and
74:24
his family
74:26
were not um
74:28
taking another drink
74:30
go for it
74:32
his family weren't even overwhelmed that
74:33
he could do that actually that's how
74:35
mary knew to tell the people to do and
74:39
he said what are you doing with me are
74:40
you trying to put me out there before my
74:41
time
74:42
he knew what she wanted him to do
74:45
because he did it at home and by the way
74:48
that wine he turned the water into was
74:50
heaven's wine it was not earthly wine it
74:53
was heaven's wine
74:55
wow that's why the guy at the wedding
74:56
said this is the best i've ever had
74:58
because it didn't come from earth and he
75:01
did it at home so mary knew hey he makes
75:04
it there she knew he supernaturally made
75:06
it we can fix this problem if you just
75:09
you know we'll go ahead and make it and
75:12
he didn't want to do it thinking that he
75:13
wasn't supposed to do it yet and yet he
75:15
did it
75:16
and so that was a good question about
75:18
that and then this would be it
75:20
when
75:21
jesus clearly knew it wasn't his time or
75:23
at least he clearly said it was this
75:25
time mary clearly needed the wine
75:29
has the lord i think he was healthy
75:33
i think it was more i think steve i
75:35
think more more than that i think mary
75:37
did know it was his time she was more of
75:40
a mother maybe more than she maybe more
75:42
than he knew
75:44
yeah i think he was he not that he
75:46
wasn't he was enjoying
75:48
you know uh helping people to know the
75:50
truth he he loved doing all that but he
75:54
didn't want to publicly be known for
75:56
that yeah it wasn't like mary did not
75:59
make a mistake okay that was probably
76:01
the holy spirit or the father pressing
76:03
her
76:04
go and ask him go and say something say
76:06
something and then tell them do whatever
76:08
he says to do she knew what they were
76:10
going to do get all the pots fill water
76:12
she knew that water would become wine
76:14
and yet she wasn't going to push him out
76:16
there to make him ahead of his time she
76:18
was actually opening the door
76:21
so when he stepped through his life
76:23
wouldn't be the same
76:25
after that point that's interesting yeah
76:27
and she never said please jesus please
76:30
son we really need this he just said
76:32
whatever he tells you that's right
76:36
honor her too that's very cool all right
76:38
well wow okay very good uh so tell
76:40
people about your two websites before we
76:41
close so they know how to get to you and
76:43

or https://youtu.be/epIBmU9OkbU

1:35
hey happy wednesday march 9 2022 it's cat cur day are you excited as i am i
1:41
love it when cat comes on and we get to ask all kinds of questions about heaven and the host and all kinds of other
1:48
questions so we've got the questions ready be sure you keep the questions coming in it's
1:53
hard to get through them all be sure you go to the clip channel as often as you can
1:59
you do that from the channel tab on youtube and youtube only there's a channel tab on the clip channel and you
2:05
and go through all of the different cat car episodes virtually everyone uh has
2:10
questions about heaven and the host and sending the host so
2:16
some people ask questions like we've said many times so we can't keep covering the same question so you got to
2:21
go into those and and and learn them but there's hundreds there's probably several hundred
2:26
questions that ken has answered so plus her book she's gotten two books on revealing heaven i hope you'll get that
2:33
uh from her website which she'll talk about at the end i think it's revealingheaven.com so
2:38
anyway welcome to the broadcast we're in year 25 of the elijah list be sure you subscribe to the elijah list because
2:44
after every show every single one uh we then send you a short time later
2:50
the photo of the guest a description of what the program was about a link to to watch it so um
2:57
you can send it to all your friends it's become very very helpful to send to all your friends
3:02
and neighbors and loved ones so they can watch the program you don't have to try and describe everything it's already
3:07
described for you and what the title of it's about hope you'll do that so subscribe that it's free
3:14
and then you know our youtube we don't haven't done this for a while but to subscribe to our youtube channel you go
3:20
to youtube.com and in their search box you type elijah streams either one or two words and when it comes up along the
3:27
bottom you see it click a thumbs up click only the red subscribe and the bell only click on it when it's
3:33
red so that you will be subscribed so thumbs up the red subscribe and the bell
3:38
if you click on it when it's gray it'll unsubscribe you so then just click it again and you'll be re-subscribed so i
3:46
think that's all of the announcements i have uh oh i paul uh one of our um
3:53
editors producers however whatever his official title is says the elijah clips
3:58
uh is also on rumble so i forgot about that so if you want to
4:04
see the clip channel i said it was only on youtube and paul is reminding me that it's on our rumble channel as well so in
4:10
the rumble channel you just put you type in elijah streams when it comes up i believe they're all
4:16
merged together rather than separate as clips you just go through the some of the shows some of the clips so the way
4:23
if it's still the way that i last saw it so i forgot about that so all right let's bring kat kerr in here
4:31
my my oh here she comes
4:36
there's no picture i'm coming down here jeff
4:43
uh i'm gonna it looks like her picture even down below is frozen in my little thumbnails so i'm gonna kick you guys
4:49
out cat and have your people just come back in
4:55
and she's gone there we go we hate to kick cat kerr off but
5:00
sometimes yeah i was talking about the other day and it just went out when i was talking
5:06
to robin i guess it was they they happened to be working on an antenna because i have a through-the-air
5:13
antenna that comes to my house from a mountain top hilltop and they happen to be working on
5:19
our specific wi-fi situation without realizing we were on the air and suddenly i was gone
5:25
so anyway we hope they get the message to come back on i don't know if
5:30
that was a slower connection that did that or just gremlins as they say
5:37
so go ahead while she's uh i'm not going to be here on um
5:43
come on jeff just come on so i'm not talking to a voice yeah a disembodied voice yeah yeah so actually
5:49
i will promote elijah fire for this weekend because i'm going to be gone on friday and so is the location so um it
5:56
is going to be amazing um saturdays is going to be andrew tau he's backing us a
6:01
great word um about this year being a do-over year and it's a really powerful
6:07
word we should we published it on the elijah list but he kind of goes into deeper
6:12
um he delves deeper into the into this word
6:18
so it's really great and then sunday we have micah turnbow who is has an amazing testimony he was a
6:25
homosexual and the lord completely flipped his life around and so he's also
6:30
a seer so he sees angels and all that crazy stuff it's going to be a really really really powerful show as well so i
6:37
mean what was his name the last one you said micah turnbow okay all right yeah so actually krista elisha recommended
6:43
him okay so talk to me while we're waiting for them to come on um so how long has elijah fire been going
6:51
and how is it elijah fire has been going since september of last year
6:57
um and then we officially broke away and we started uh we took a break for the
7:02
holidays and then we started up again in january on our own
7:08
channel um with your blessings yeah and and i always get confused how it's connected
7:14
because if i can find it through elijah streams which i think i can then it's
7:19
like somehow still connected to us yeah so it's still it's an extension it's an arm yeah
7:26
so when you say our own and you use breakaway i thought no no jeff's not leaving us he hasn't started
7:32
his rights correct talk about your plans for a
7:38
uh for changing that to the week days and when how long ah in the future are we looking
7:45
for that i mean we're looking at sometime in the next couple of months breaking away uh
7:51
not breaking away getting away from weekends and going to weekdays and we're going to be doing live shows
7:58
at that point as much as we can and so i'm i'm really excited about that we don't have an exact date where we're
8:06
looking at that there's a couple of things we're hiring a new person to take over this which a lot of people are
8:12
aware of at this point because i had to come on and talk about it um and so we hired that individual her name
8:17
is emily she's amazing really talented uh so she's gonna be taking over all of
8:23
my duties that were on this show so she'll be she'll you'll see her instead
8:28
of me uh if there's a situation like this where cat has technical difficulties or somebody
8:34
else so yeah and by the way and maybe michael can either come on the air but we're he says
8:40
working on getting their cam and mike back so we don't have them yet we don't know how
8:46
long it's going to be yeah so uh what else should we
8:51
riff about what else should we we should riff about well i'll talk a
8:57
little bit more about elijah fire while we're waiting um we're we're looking at adding in a lot more variety there's
9:02
some stuff i don't want to say yet because i love surprises and i love you know i
9:08
i'm i'm just that's the way i am uh and so uh but i'm i'm very excited because
9:14
it's gonna be very much a lot of the um
9:19
a lot of what is there already you know having conversations with different people but we're looking at bringing in
9:25
a lot more variety in terms of our focus and uh there might be a couple of days where we actually
9:31
shift into a specific focus one of the things that a lot of people who watch the jennifer martin episode know is
9:36
we're going to be doing a series on deliverance and so i want to start doing that as different series that focus on
9:42
different things on specific days and that really resonated with people it's a that's a very crucial thing so
9:48
cat is here [Music] we got her back okay thanks jeff i
9:53
appreciate it well we stalled and gave some good announcements chat in the meantime
9:59
i guess they need to kind of square up your camera just a little bit there you're kind of off to the side you don't
10:05
want to lose you uh so if anyone can hear that and there you go i feel so much better so what
10:11
today my tie almost matches your hair a little darker i can see that we're getting closer so well it's good to be
10:17
with you cat i'm glad we got you back where i thought i was beginning to wonder i'm going to run out of things to say here in a minute and so
10:25
i know that's hard to believe if you knew me but i usually have something
10:31
anyway so cat we're gonna jump into questions in a minute but uh
10:37
do you have anything to see just tell what's on your heart and talk about anything you want to talk about current events anything before we do that
10:44
well the only current current events right now of course is the convoy of the usa convoy
10:50
i'm real excited they've already tried several ways to stop them it's not working
10:55
um i guess they think that they can make an order and and you know we the people are actually going to listen to those
11:01
who don't want this country who aren't running it right they still think that they can tell us what to do and
11:07
i think those days are coming to an end very quickly because we the people are helping this trucker convoy in every way
11:15
we can they try to shut off gas people bring them gas it's crazy uh they're
11:20
sitting up even more and more people have had time and the canadian one of course we know that kicked it all off
11:26
yay for canada i can tell you that i've always liked canada but but they had
11:31
more time to plan this one in america because of the the canadian one going on
11:36
so they learned some things from them and added some things of what they were doing but i love it that they actually
11:42
were working together in a way to do this uh in an unplanned way but that was
11:47
totally god having us come together you know canada and america to want to
11:53
display that we're taking our freedom we want freedom of liberty and justice we've already made displays that we're
12:00
we're taking our freedom and that's what we have that's what we deserve here in our country and actually every country
12:06
in the world does you know they deserve to be free god made us his free people i don't even know if you realize this but
12:12
god never intended to assign kings his plan original plan was not to assign kings over countries
12:20
at one time they were demanding to have a king that's why people got salt it didn't turn out really well did it
12:26
anyway so god had intended for man to be free and be accountable to themselves help
12:32
one another that was what he wanted and of course the devil gets involved every way he can and uh of course the devil
12:39
still thinks he's when he's won and this whole thing is not over but he already he should realize
12:45
that the foundation they built in this uh fake administration and uh
12:50
because of our our the stolen election and you know what i'm not the only one still saying that there's even papers
12:57
printing in that there's even a few networks now saying that the election stolen i am so excited
13:03
about that because it's coming to the day when as the father showed me they will literally have to say
13:09
on those same news networks that went along with it being stolen they will actually have to say
13:15
that they they had to admit it whether they wanted to or not that the 2020 election was stolen that trump is a
13:21
rightful president and then he will have his four years starting from that time when it's
13:28
recognized and announced and uh and judged that it was still and from that day they will have to give him four
13:35
more years so i know everybody's talking about 2022 that's this year you know the midterm elections will be happening uh
13:42
then 2024 is supposed to be another whole time when the major elections take
13:48
place i think that's not gonna happen because if he gets four more years it
13:53
starts it would start this year if that's when this happens then in this year they'd have to start four years
13:59
four more years for trump that would even change the electoral dates to vote how about that that's how
14:06
significant this whole thing is wouldn't that be amazing it would be amazing i want you to i want
14:12
to clarify something so people get don't misquote you you kind of said um if that's what
14:18
happened it sounded almost like you said that will be this year and then you said if that if that's what happened so are
14:24
you saying that will be this year or you're saying if it's recognized understanding
14:29
if that happens this year if the whole turnaround happens and that announcement is made remember
14:36
god showed me he didn't show me the year it would happen uh he did
14:42
of course show me on november the 4th that it was stolen but whenever that year comes when that
14:47
announcement you just heard me say that will be an announcement that will be made
14:53
when that day and time happens there's no way that they can escape knowing and understanding that the 2020
15:00
elections were stolen and the father showed me this on november the 4th
15:06
uh you know when the elections actually basically that evening in november the third when it was actually stolen
15:12
and they announced on november the 4th that the wrong person had um had won
15:18
when that announcement is made on the secular television these are the words that they will say we don't want to admit this but there's
15:24
no way we can get out of knowing and admitting that the 2020 elections were
15:30
stolen and trump did win them those words will be spoken on the day when
15:36
that when they realize there's no way they can escape admitting it i'm not saying those words will be spoken right
15:42
now i'm saying they will be spoken the father showed me in the future the network's having to admit that that that
15:50
even they have to lie about it by the way it will be known and justice will come he said everything will be exposed
15:57
including that there will come a time and you will know for sure
16:02
when particular people say those words we have to admit it although we don't want to that the 2020 elections were
16:09
stolen and trump did win those words will happen i'm not saying now but when
16:14
they do happen from the time that is admitted and exposed from that time they will
16:21
have to give trump four more years now let me ask you a question kat um there
16:27
uh there are people that say the problem with you patriots or the problem with eu
16:33
trumpians or whatever name they would they would supply us they'll say is not only did god take
16:40
trump away because you guys were looking at him as a savior but god's not going to bring him back because you're looking
16:46
at him as as a savior instead of the lord how would you respond to that i would say this is god's will not man's
16:54
god's will is he chose him and he's going to let him complete his next four years and he is still saying that to me
17:01
i don't look at him as my savior right i know jesus christ is my savior i know the father god is his father i know holy
17:08
spirit i know the divine trinity and i know what their plans are and they and fully intend for trump to have his
17:15
second four year term and no one can stop that from happening not the devil
17:21
not the left not mankind anyone is greater than god this is god saying this
17:27
god is saying he will give trump his next four-year term when that is known
17:32
and shown and exposed they will have to give him his second four years because it was stolen if something is stolen you
17:38
have to give it back people you can't ignore and act like it never happened and go on with your life that is not
17:45
justice yeah and the father has been adamant about justice being son no that
17:50
was people who have minds who don't understand how god operates or when god says something he actually means it god
17:57
has not changed his mind and so because man can't understand that they try to put their own
18:02
they put their own spin on that well i guess this is what's happening and and because this didn't happen or somebody
18:08
did this god changed his mind i tell you from the throne he did not change his
18:14
mind about that and you better stop saying he did you can't put words in your mouth that don't belong to god and
18:20
say it's god god chooses he chose that election was one and that
18:27
is what we voted for over almost 100 million people voted correctly
18:32
and the other side still hopes that they have trying to cover it up but
18:38
we the people we the people have this country we say we want justice done and god is saying
18:45
justice will be served concerning that 2020 election
18:50
so i'd like to see some weaseling man stand up anywhere say they have more
18:56
power than the living god they know more than him hey that sounds like satan
19:01
that's what he's always thought and every time he has failed failed failed in his attempts to take over
19:06
the devil doesn't get this country and he doesn't get the world at this time this is some of the greatest days we're
19:12
entering into and god fully intends to work his plan guess what i side with god
19:19
that's good good good good awesome cat really good um i have not
19:24
asked you on the air or off the air um i suppose god doesn't tell you every
19:30
single thing about every single issue you know but i have not asked you so i don't know if you have anything at all
19:36
to say about ukraine has the lord showing you anything or simply not showing you anything about that
19:43
i know the one thing he did show me was right before uh well you know what
19:48
this is the thing about all that we do know the fake news is still being fake right no way they can get around it if
19:54
you all have not seen the video where they're supposedly showing other people people who had died over there in
20:01
the ukraine and had all these bodies neatly lined up in a row which wouldn't
20:06
have happened neatly with a blanket laid over top of each one of them i happen to
20:11
know when that when people are killed in war they're put in a body bag they don't have a nice little fleece blanket put
20:16
over top of them and during the course of this reporter giving the report of all these people
20:21
that died a mysterious arm came up from underneath one of the blankets because
20:26
it was falling off of them and the dead person supposedly was trying to fix it with their live arm so what do you think
20:33
is going on people they're still lying and they're going to keep lying i think god has a plan and always has had a plan
20:39
for the ukraine i think at this time that russia does not want to take over the world i think
20:45
that as long as there's a person whose name uh ends with um whose name last
20:51
name ends with a t i don't think they try to do anything like that and so you can figure that out for
20:56
yourself but i do know that god has many people in the ukraine and all people can seem to talk about as wicked and evil
21:02
people everywhere in the world guess what there's more good people good moral people in this world than
21:09
there are wicked the wicked the few the evil ones they're the ones you try to control that's what's in every communist
21:15
country well i guess we got some music coming in here to celebrate we got all kinds of
21:21
sounds going on today so i'm just saying i think a lot of that is being faked i'm not saying all of it is but what are you
21:28
going to believe if if the ones who lied all along about everything else now they're lying about that i think there
21:34
are some covert operations happening in the ukraine and i'm not going to say who's doing them i think during this
21:40
this kind of cover thing going on with them i think some evil people may actually be removed in the ukraine that
21:48
we're interfering with other things going on so i think that's more what's going on than russia just trying to come
21:54
in and take over that country and i also may think i just can say this
21:59
from my own thinking that there is always going to be a facade put forward through this entire
22:06
um operation whatever you want to call it the fake operation i think there's going to be a lot of things made up and
22:12
displayed that are not the truth so i think you know when you're going to find out when it all falls apart and justice
22:19
is served in every line cheating stealing killing people manipulating person is going to be exposed as far as
22:26
what the father is still saying to me and the father knows even talking about the near future that is great that is
22:34
amazing that takes us accelerates us because of this time of the enemy
22:39
attempting to take over god really is um i can't say he's behind it all i'm
22:45
saying he's going to use what the enemy is doing to really expose who is evil so we don't have to wonder about that in
22:51
the future who not to put in power whom not to vote for who who to put in prison i think that's more of what's going on i
22:57
think it's all part of justice being served but if you've never been involved in law or investigations you really
23:04
don't understand how these things happen so i think that god is going to make sure we never forget what communism and
23:11
socialism is like who who do you vote for make sure that everything's working when you vote number one
23:18
because this was not the fault to the people it was not the fault of the body of christ it was not the fault of
23:24
president trump that this thing happened this was the devil literally trying to use wicked even evil people with weak
23:30
minds to try to take over before his time literally that is what is happening
23:36
therefore they have no power no right no authority not from heaven not really even on earth everything they've done
23:43
has been stolen taken and forced upon people you cannot take a free country
23:50
and say you're going to take it away from we the people who are free yes we still have our guns and says god said
23:57
they won't get your guns they may see them but they won't get them i'll just leave it at that whole thing yeah that's good
24:04
that's good well you know and i think both robin and especially johnny because he said this several times johnny andelo
24:10
is if you know if you want to discern you're watching the news the regular mainstream news and you want to just
24:17
discern what's really true ask yourself what are they desperately all the same channels all the different
24:23
channels they're all they're all saying the same thing what do they want you to believe
24:29
and they have right here normally when they're hammering something like that it's the opposite it's the opposite
24:35
they're trying to create a narrative so i think when you know um
24:42
putin's certainly not a lily white saint but i believe it will be found out that
24:47
when he said we're going in for a military operation it will be found out one day that he went in for a military
24:52
operation uh to remove some some bad actors that
24:57
needed to be removed so and some of it i understand is hitting the media i'm not going to say it yet until i prove it's
25:02
in the media but um it's and i was watching a report the other day not on the mainstream
25:09
a guy had a list like this long yeah i ran out of time and every single item
25:14
was the next fake picture fake picture video and this is where this was this fake picture and this is
25:20
where this one you know the one where um zielinski is in a helmet that was a
25:25
couple years ago they showed a guy in the tank that was a comedian posing for a picture not so
25:31
little but another community picture after picture they said this is that and it wasn't
25:36
that so i think that uh the eb person has put a lot of people on research duty
25:42
you go through the archives of photographs especially military operations i think that's what their main thing's been going on right now is
25:49
find whatever you can find that looks like it's now and that's really probably what they're doing to manufacture and
25:55
make up things i mean people have known for years that you could fake photos and fake all kinds of stuff you can get
26:01
enough people to watch like they were doing with the weather uh back when you know because we have been taking
26:06
authority over the weather it's been very uh very different weather systems coming in now even around this country
26:12
especially when they were trying to make it look like if you remember when that storm was coming
26:18
that had begun to dissipate and that man had fans on him looking like he was going to blow over and behind him
26:24
walking upright were two teenagers boy was that that was a fake one
26:29
that was a fake news report i mean the guy is still acting like he's going to blow over and here's two teenagers
26:34
walking totally upright behind him on purpose and the cameraman didn't see it so i think it's still a lot of that
26:40
thing going on right now i do want to add this there are people in the ukraine that we know of who are giving us their
26:46
own reports they're not the reports that are being given on the news so i can just tell you take it with less than a
26:52
grain of salt maybe with more pepper in it okay because i can just say a lot of it is made is
26:58
made up that they're saying because they want to put fear in you and yet god did not give us a spirit of fear but of
27:04
power love and a sound working mind people so that's where god has got you
27:11
if you don't have a spirit of power love and a sound mind you're listening to the
27:17
fake news or you're listening to the devil it might be the both that's good good good well cat we can
27:23
even talk about the rest this for the whole rest of time i guess we'll get into some questions if you're up for it
27:28
all right so now you might remember i don't know if you remember i i had a word of knowledge uh and it turned out to be a woman young
27:35
woman in norway uh her name is ellen she put that i saw a woman with a ski cap and this and you
27:42
were just on the slope so she stays in touch with me since that happened and she i i'm gonna ask two
27:48
quick questions for her she watches you i think she you're the only program she watches so
27:53
she said our country has many words from god about a war that will come can we can we pray against prophetic words like
28:00
that like a war is coming does he give us this information for us to pray so that would not happen or is he just
28:06
warning us about what is going to happen um i think you can always pray against
28:12
destruction um i think any any believer can pray against destruction uh god's intent is
28:19
not to harm uh innocent people or have a war i do know that he has repeatedly
28:24
told me there will be no world war three because that's what people started saying when all this started happening
28:30
and god said no that is not true there will not be another world war right now i'm not saying there won't be skirmishes
28:36
and that depends on what that war is all about and since i don't know that and he didn't he didn't say that to me the
28:43
thing about answering things like that is he didn't tell me and he didn't show me okay and i i do have a lot of people
28:50
wanting me to tell other people or actually everyone out there things they saw and heard and when i can't do that
28:57
i'm a messenger for god i'm not a messenger for messengers and so uh i ca but but as far as praying
29:04
you can always pray against destruction you can pray against the enemy's plans you can send the host to pull down any
29:10
any stronghold trying to build an area that might want to bring war you can always take authority in that area um i
29:17
think it will probably be between now and probably 2030 i think there might be a couple skirmishes in different places
29:24
uh i don't think it's going to be full out war anywhere and i can't talk about that uh either because i just can't talk
29:31
about it but i have not seen any great things of mass destruction happening um using a lot of
29:39
these weapons that they've said could wipe out like millions of people at one time that is not going to happen at all
29:45
and uh not not probably in your lifetime anyway we still have several hundred years left in this world and god intends
29:51
for the next 100 to be so powerfully glorious over the glory the power the
29:57
might of god the manifested sons and daughters walking on the earth they're actually here now uh starting to take
30:04
authority over the land the sea the air mass destructions all kinds of things that they've been anointed and appointed
30:11
to do that but we as a body should always be in agreement with what god wants god doesn't want war right now
30:17
he's going to restore and accelerate for greatness
30:23
greatness and celebration is what god is wanting in this time it'd be pretty hard for the devil to think he could sneak
30:29
around god and pull off something but always if you hear even if it's a rumor you can always take authority over i
30:35
take power over that uh rumor or that plan plan is a good thing to use i take
30:41
part in over that plane to bring destruction to anywhere in any place at any time i come in the host of evidence
30:47
you pull down the strongholds rip away the the lies that are being shown or anything that's being proposed
30:53
that we could even people evil people that it fails fails fails in jesus name
30:59
i think i think bob jones have every right to say that as a believer bob jones had a word and i'm just from
31:06
memory but i think this is correct he people asked him he wasn't a weather warrior like you are that wasn't his
31:11
calling but people asked him can you pray against that and at the time he said you can certainly pray the death out of it
31:18
and then i think you as a weather warrior you actually did that kind of thing not only were you pushing the
31:23
storms back uh but you would but you were praying the death out of that too weren't you uh
31:37
so i brought that up at the same time as we're talking about a prophesied war if a storm's heading your way and the media
31:43
is saying it's going to hit jacksonville where you're from that's a prophecy it may be a secular one but they're trying
31:50
to prophesy that it's gonna hit if they if that were true um that's i'm just making that up that's not a real thing
31:56
if that happened you would then just begin to instead of accept that okay
32:01
guys there's gonna it's gonna hit you would start what how would you how would i take authority over that the
32:08
that whole entire system immediately it's my right to do that jesus stopped the storms and jesus had
32:14
authority over the weather over the water that he walked on i mean he had authority we have a right to do that to
32:21
stop destruction you're right about that see if i'm not tolerating anything not just here but we
32:26
actually have a whole group of tens of thousands of people who are weather warriors that are activated the minute
32:32
anything comes anywhere pretty much around the world we have weather watchers who let us know what's going on if we're not aware of it so if it was
32:38
headed here like it was a probably a few months ago they were saying a horrific storm was going to come and there'd be
32:45
uh torrential rains it would cause severe flooding that that there would be you
32:50
know the winds would come and cause great destruction and i said my first thing to that was no it won't i won't
32:57
tolerate it in jesus name i take power over all the power of the enemy trying to bring destruction through the weather
33:03
and i will right now speak to you and said you will not you will not be successful in that plan i take power
33:09
over the devil i command the host of heaven to get in that system and begin to shred the bands of that storm you
33:16
will not allow destruction to come to this area where i live i'm not tolerating it
33:22
sometimes i go outside and i point my staff in the direction this thing is coming and i say you will become nothing
33:27
in jesus name you will only come and bring a light rain a nourishing rain but you aren't allowed nor will i tolerate
33:33
your construction to my city in any way whatsoever and i'd be coming in the middle of ours to begin to rise or lower
33:39
whatever needs to happen and then the host will literally shred the bands of the storm like in the system and they
33:46
will announce on the weather we don't know what's happened but now the system is beginning to break up so i guess we
33:51
better remove those uh that torrential weather that's supposed to be coming
33:56
and years and you've said recently that the what you just described
34:01
is some of the activities of the manifested sons and daughters of god that when they're beginning to speak to
34:07
mountains to whether so if people have asked the question what do i need to do to become a sons and daughters uh or
34:14
manifested sons of daughters well you would start with that kind of thing are you right
34:22
to take authority over the plans of the enemy and god actually said i'm starting with the weather that's what he said to
34:28
me when he said this is what you're going to be doing before i ever started doing it he said you're going to start whether warriors and it will be the
34:35
first time the body of christ from every denomination non-denomination or known denomination where they will come
34:40
together for one purpose and that is to stop destruction of the storms and you begin to train them every time you go on
34:47
the air you will have a weather warrior training session and then literally when a system started out and out in the
34:54
atlantic ocean or coming from the other side of the tip of africa which is where a lot of the hurricanes come from
35:00
we learned how to speak against them starting there and so many of them failed to get about halfway across and
35:06
they become nothing uh or or you know what we've actually built a wall of faith all up the east coast here because
35:14
so many of us we went to the beach wherever they were or held their hands out and said uh the father god made this
35:20
earth when he put the water in the ocean he said a boundary said you will not go
35:25
beyond this boundary you cannot come ashore it actually says in the bible that god declared this that we agreed with him
35:32
and said you're not coming ashore no matter what you try to do there's no way you're coming in we're not allowing it
35:37
releasing our faith in our trust that this is what will happen and they haven't had one literally come ashore
35:43
since then it'll come along hit that wall and it will start up up back up into the ocean yes you have authority
35:49
christ did it he gave us the right and the power to do that so that's what we do we're not allowing it awesome well uh
35:57
ellen has one other question about the host i'm going to blend her question with mike
36:02
with my question because i do every i think in big numbers whether it's dollars or
36:10
whatever it is everything is big to me so if i send a host i probably send way too many
36:16
uh because i just think why why waste the opportunity in case there's not enough so if i if someone would send 10
36:22
i'd send 10 000. it's just all right and then i'll tell god look if that's too many it's up to you to hold
36:28
them back you know so then the other god's not going to haul them back steve
36:34
well and then there's then there's this question which is the other side of the coin where ellen is saying how many
36:40
hosts should i send uh for one person in other words a person that's in need i was thinking one
36:46
host is probably enough for one person but then i started thinking that one person could have six thousand demons um
36:53
so how do i know how many i should send and then she wants to know what if what about what how many should i send for a
37:01
city with a hundred thousand people so that's the she needs to watch
37:06
one of our events we will be having this year will be called the host
37:11
initiative and you will learn strategies every kind of strategy for every situation you you
37:18
can possibly think of that may or may not may not happen which would not be just the weather the host initiative
37:24
which is is about um uh working with the army in heaven and commanding them i like how would you send how many for
37:30
this what about this can we send them around the world so many of those questions will be answered and that's probably the only way we'll ever get to
37:37
answer a lot of them is by so we're having a whole event called host initiative and that's really when you'll learn the
37:43
most about it but i would say if you're sending them to your kids college to pull down drug trafficking or something
37:48
like that you're not going to need a million to do that okay you might stand five or ten to do something like that if
37:54
it's something trying to take over a city you then could think probably into the thousands to send them there i right
38:00
now will send a billion i'll take and send a billion to the north south east and what that would be four billion if
38:06
i'm covering the earth taking authority over a certain thing is going on i will do that and they will pull down every
38:11
stronghold they come no matter where it is or how that happens they begin to shred the platforms of evil operating
38:17
with the evil people and then the other thing i'll give them excuse me more than one thing to do when
38:23
i send them okay and you can't i think for you you get so so excited about you
38:28
have authority and if you send ten thousand they're going and i can tell you what you do if i'm sending extras
38:34
you will then go into every street and uh hallway and alley in the city i'm
38:40
sending them to once you complete that go into every street and every building and pull down every stronghold there
38:45
that way the other ones have something to do that would be something we would teach you in the in the host initiative
38:51
so you can always add to what you're sending them you may send them for specific things in an area but you can
38:58
always send more with them to pull down stuff you can even say within 500 miles of where i set those i can send them to
39:04
a thousand miles 10 000 miles and they will keep going until they have completed what you're given orders like
39:12
you wrote them down you're the headquarters for heaven when you have an army you send them from where you're at
39:19
you tell them what to do because we our military has to operate on on orders
39:24
they can't make it up their cell it seems like you told me or us together
39:30
that when you go out every you know dark in the wee hours of the morning to start sending the host which you do every day
39:35
if i understand i think you described them as sitting there waiting with their hands folded was that you that said that
39:41
your hosts were sitting there waiting well i was i kind of had this comical thought this morning whether that was
39:47
you or or someone else if i was gonna send a hundred or a thousand
39:53
and i decided to send a hundred i'm thinking here's 900 angels saying go
39:58
send me send me send me because if i don't send them they're going to just sit there and do nothing so yeah they
40:04
will be bored steve you you have an army from heaven that was assigned to you i
40:10
have one assigned to me i can't tell yours what to do my i can't tell my husband's what to do
40:15
he he has an army from heaven he sends on assignments to other places yes they don't want to sit there do
40:20
nothing they were sent to you to command and send out so this is this is this is since 2014
40:29
when the army was assigned to us on the earth you have to invite them to come
40:34
let me tell you there's so many parameters and dynamics to just saying that number one you can't be sinning
40:40
they're not going to listen to you yeah you could have had an army that you've been commanding for five years decide
40:45
you're going to live a life of sin they will leave they don't have to obey someone who's remember they hearken under the word of
40:51
the lord that means when it sounds like things he would say the lord was pure
40:57
and holy you know he is the lord of hosts he still is the lord of hosts jesus is still over all of the armies of
41:04
heaven everywhere he knows when they're assigned somewhere he knows that we have the right to send them that if we would
41:09
send them where they need to go to to bring um destruction to the enemy's plans to push crush back that the planes
41:16
of of hell and yes that's going to affect the people in the natural who are doing it because you take authority
41:22
first in the spirit which is the original eternal realm this physical
41:28
realm was wrapped around part of it so he could make us and send us to this earth so but the spirit realm is the
41:34
eternal realm that's what it is and that's where the army operates in yes they come to earth but the spirit realm
41:40
is still around here and they operate according to the orders you give them and they cannot make up orders their
41:46
self in other words unless you say something to your army like okay i'm sending you over here i've heard that
41:52
there's new new um let's just say there's new terrorists moved into this area of america i would send like a
41:59
hundred thousand because it was a great group coming in i sent a hundred thousand to pull down every stronghold
42:04
of satan empowering them speaking to them uh revealing things to them so they could do evil deeds i take authority
42:12
over the spiritual evil first and we have that removed shut the mouths
42:17
of the demons they can't speak to the people who are doing these deeds take away the power that they're giving them
42:22
and then they what happens is wicked man when they have no power they feel powerful inside when the enemy is
42:29
helping them great fear falls on them and then after fear confusion comes so
42:34
you are affecting this this world by learning to operate with
42:40
the authority christ gave you to command the host of heaven you are making a difference i have a brother who would like rather
42:46
just go shoot the people in the natural he's not really accomplishing anything
42:51
because we rule and reign with christ in the kingdom he talked about which is
42:56
a spiritual kingdom that has real positions real grounds real authority in
43:01
the spirit realm and that's where you have to be able to see that this is what's happening but you do have a
43:08
position in that kingdom jesus clearly talked about how important it was to understand that we may have to do a
43:14
whole thing on just what is the kingdom
43:20
they could do this this one subject the whole thing but you i it's very
43:25
clear to me because i've heard you talk about it so many times they're not going to obey your command if you're in sin or
43:31
you're sinning so that le you mentioned a little bit ago you could have had an army for five years
43:38
that you're commanding and so my question is how specific is it so i'm commanding the
43:44
army and then somehow without i i got into a fleshly place today and i got
43:51
into a fight uh with somebody in a verbal fight and we just parted and i said some words
43:57
with my mouth that effectively were cursing words i don't mean you swore to say
44:02
they're just no good and then you forget about it
44:09
when you do that anybody doing that you better nullify the words you just spoke yeah because otherwise the words will
44:15
remain i'll go and play to hear words people spoke yeah so my question about the host cat is if
44:21
you did that and you didn't nullify it and then a little while later you forgot about it and you're starting to send the
44:27
host will they just sit there with their arms folded because they're probably gonna wait for you to say something
44:34
it's not the same as going out and sleeping with everybody down the street okay i just get to be real blunt to me
44:40
to save time if you're doing that your arm is leaving it's going back to heaven so i mean that's a lifestyle of sin okay
44:47
if you do something it says we should always have a good report to give we should always have
44:52
words that help heal and bring hope and joy and celebration and reveal who god is that's
44:59
what we're supposed to be doing that's what jesus did but you know jesus was angry but didn't sin
45:06
when he threw everything in the temple i mean he was mad he was mad he had had it with all the the cheaters and the
45:11
steelers even he didn't like them when they tried to cheat the people buying the sacrifices he had just gotten it god
45:17
didn't tell him to tear up the temple that was his decision yeah the courtyard the courtyard the holy spirit is now correcting me okay they taught the
45:24
courtyard of where the vendors were i mean he threw tables people those tables weren't an inch thick they were made out
45:29
of timbers he was strong he picked up probably six inch timber made out of timber tables and flew them everywhere
45:36
and he was smashing stuff well he didn't sin because he that was righteous wrath that's not giving you the right to do it
45:42
i'm only using it as an example okay god didn't hold that against christ he didn't withhold his power
45:48
but christ himself could not have gone out and just killed anybody he wanted to uh that would have been wrong in his
45:53
time even uh he couldn't go sleep with somebody which he never would have done and i'm not saying he ever did that he
45:59
never did that there's a difference um there's a difference in being angry and upset
46:04
and there's a difference in sin causes you to be unrighteous okay sin
46:10
makes you unrighteous not righteous what i would tell people to do you know i've been upset a couple times with
46:15
people and i'll just say even if they've walked away i may call them later send them in the text saying sorry i got
46:21
angry uh you know i'm sorry i got angry that's all i would say but if i say words and i keep saying
46:27
them it depends if you say something like you're an idiot you're stupid or something like that well maybe they are maybe they need with god instead i'll
46:33
pray for them to have sound wisdom instead but there's a this this it's like there's a thin line in some areas
46:39
but some areas you're angry you're upset about things you should always say for your own soul because you have to
46:46
understand if you if you shredded somebody and you really just couldn't stand them
46:51
you couldn't stay in them don't ever say you wish they would die don't ever say those words that's god's not going to do
46:57
that if you say words and you know you said them then you say i nullify every
47:02
word i just spoke in that situation i nullify everywhere and spoke over that person i i come in to be removed from
47:09
the atmosphere and i loose it from my soul because guess what if you don't lose those anger words out of your soul
47:16
you'll say them again because when they're in there you'll think about them the most important thing is to make sure you loosen from
47:22
your own soul apologize to the person if you if you get the opportunity
47:27
maybe it was on the road because i happen to know men don't like people to pass them in cars so they yell them you
47:33
know they say things maybe they should i'm not saying curse words either we'll say profanity i'm not saying you use
47:39
profanity but you know you you said some very unkind things to them you're not going to be able to stop them down the
47:44
road down the road they'll think you're having road rage so no but you can say yourself father forgive me for being
47:50
angry forgive me for speaking those words against that person i loosen from my soul and nullify the effect that they
47:56
would have that's what you need to say that's good and so you live a lifestyle that and
48:01
then your that's my lifestyle okay i don't keep anything in my soul that would interfere
48:06
with my relationship with god or or the authority and dominion i walk in i'm not
48:12
letting the devil get that away from me at all but he's not going to it's time for me
48:17
when it's my time to send the host i will just make sure i've confessed i'll
48:22
say forgive me for my sins lord known or unknown i just didn't just didn't want anything to get in the
48:29
way of it well i have a question that's very wise t that's very wise okay
48:34
well i'm not necessarily i'll do it when whenever something happens but that is a wise thing for people who don't think
48:39
about that because they'll be sitting there staring at you they were there when you said it [Laughter]
48:47
yeah okay well now um a couple of children's questions and then we'll go on uh to the other ones so
48:55
uh this is a mom who's asking for her five-year-old son jase jace asked me if jesus hands still hurt from being
49:03
crucified i told him they don't but i'm sure he'd love to hear kat tell jace
49:09
the answer to this does jesus hand still hurt from being crucified they don't hurt jace because
49:16
he's in his glorified body he's in his glorified body right now
49:21
that that but that body that experienced that you know on the cross and the things they did to christ
49:27
uh that body was buried his spirit man came out of that body of course and we know that he went into abraham's bosom
49:34
he did different activities but but the third day in hell
49:39
now in his spiritual body they didn't really hurt him at all those are physical wounds i have to explain those
49:45
were physical wounds that were done to his fleshly body that body was in the
49:51
tomb those three days that christ descended and he did things in his spiritual
49:56
spirit man his spirit man was not hurting his spirit man was not hurting from the physical wounds he got that
50:03
would be like saying you know you died and whatever let's say there was an attack in a foreign country and you were
50:09
shot and buried in that foreign country but you're a believer and your spirit man from that point where that happened
50:15
in the country your angels came and took you to heaven you wouldn't even feel anything at that time in your spiritual
50:20
body so uh there's a difference in your spirit man and your physical man experiencing things but jesus right now
50:27
when he came up out of that grave he picked his body up it was glorified that means it can never die he can never uh
50:33
nothing like that can ever happen to him again you can put your finger through the hole by the way the hole i'm going to hold my
50:39
hand up i'm trying to look at the camera and see see i'm not a technical person god didn't pick like the brilliant most
50:44
brilliant people in this world person to give them 20 years of revelation okay it's like eight years old i saw his hand
50:51
the wound is here it is not here if they had nailed into the cross this it would
50:57
have ripped through his hand the wounds are right here uh but you can put your finger all the way through it you know
51:03
and heaven he's got his physical body but it's glorified it's it's uh it'll it'll be it's um
51:09
i'm trying to think of the word now it's eternal forever he cannot figure it out but you can put your finger in his
51:14
wounds or in the hand in the side if you want to he's in no more pain at all he's
51:19
still with glory and joy and celebration because of himself being willing to sacrifice himself for us
51:26
so no he's not in any pain but you can see scars on that body because you know
51:31
why he kept the scars there evidence that he did it almost everyone who goes to heaven they want to see the scarves
51:38
that where he paid the price on the cross they all want to see when his hair blows you know you can see the little
51:44
holes where the growing really that's together too huh wow yeah but they're not bleeding right right i didn't know
51:50
you could still see the scars there those are his battle scars are you kidding me there's evidence that he
51:56
actually went to the cross and he you're not proud of them but he's so blessed that he paid that price for us but
52:03
everybody does want to see him and every time i'm seeing jesus in person you know if i see his hands i see the
52:10
scars but he's not hurting from them jace he's doing great that's good all right now monique asked about her 10
52:17
year old son wants to know will jesus play laser tag with him in heaven that's it absolutely yes he will
52:26
jesus loves to play with kids especially with children because um they're so filled with fun and joy and kids don't
52:34
question things you know a lot even when they go to heaven they're like the thing getting in their head how is that
52:39
possible you know how can you ride on light how can how can you swim under the water and breathe i mean how can you do these
52:45
things but kids don't they just run they ride on the roller coaster that leaps off the track and does things i mean
52:51
they ride on the wind they ride on the rainbow right kids are kids so jesus definitely
52:57
loves to play with children in heaven laser tag would be a yes awesome awesome awesome all right
53:03
myra asks cat cat said report that there's no dark places or night in heaven only a constant light emitting
53:10
from the father but how do things look like they have dimension without shadows wouldn't a tree look flat
53:17
uh without shadows how can you and then she wasn't how could you ever see stars or planets without
53:24
darkness i guess you know i'm trying to shorten this but because it's god's house heaven the world heaven is god's
53:31
home and he can display whatever wonders he wants to and there are places in heaven that you
53:38
can step through a doorway and you're like it's it's a part of space but of course it's around heaven it's like
53:44
you're not going to see saturn and stuff like that but you actually can see the actual stars like right from heaven you
53:50
go to this beautiful place except you're in this whole part of the sky it's just some things you can't explain
53:57
but there are ways to see and i can tell you the the bands of the rainbow that go around heaven looking for people to
54:02
bring them back to god so we can visit with them that light is so vivid and i was taken
54:08
the first time i went people think it's so strange i wasn't taken to the snowman in the first time they took me to a
54:14
movie theater in heaven the first time i went to show to show me something number one people who are actors and get saved
54:21
they go to heaven they still get to act uh you can sign up to be in different movies in heaven there's going to be no
54:27
movies in heaven they don't have to rate them okay there's no rating because there's no defilement no pornography
54:33
there's no profanity there's no sadistic torture those movies don't have them but
54:38
they're exciting intense fun and amazing and i was shown several actors who had
54:44
passed away and they were they were in heaven and they had made movies but approaching the place they took me to
54:51
and even though there's light all over heaven sometimes the light is different colors it could be like peachy pink it'd
54:57
be turquoise teals it could be purples light purples so you're not thinking about walking outside here and you see a
55:04
sky that is just one color it isn't like that you don't step into just all light everywhere but there are
55:10
no shadows and i tell you why because the light comes from the very ground of
55:16
heaven the ground xenon has light coming from it so it would be impossible to have a
55:22
shadow if the lights under the trees showing up through the branches of the you're not going to see a shadow under
55:29
that tree but nobody cares about that in heaven they feel the wind on their faces the wind blowing all over heaven and
55:35
beautiful wind um so that would answer the light part but the light coming
55:41
advertising that you were approaching this big massive movie theater complex had places to eat it was there was so
55:48
much fun going on there the rays shining from the building like
55:54
different colored rays going back and forth in the sky over where the cedar was there's no way you can mistake that
56:00
that was coming from that theater so it's heaven and because the father desires uh for things to be displayed a
56:07
certain way you still would wonder that's what the whole wonder part is you're always going to look around you'd
56:13
be so amazed at the wonder and splendor that is there now you you mentioned this is why you
56:19
were talking this you mentioned about movies being made in heaven and so my generation would maybe want to know is john wayne making movies and when they
56:26
make movies do they have a camera and do or is it one time i think you said you can act in it
56:32
so do they film it and play it or is it live every time or how would you describe a movie in heaven
56:39
they have a whole different way they talk about producing movies in heaven um it's captured
56:46
there you go it's captured it's almost sort of like live stream kind of thing
56:52
it's always going to be live action they don't have a back lot like hollywood does where they make fake screens but
56:58
fake images on there oh no it's live and in action and i did see john wayne
57:04
himself going across they have a whole part in heaven that looks like the prairie and he was on this horse and
57:10
there was two young people behind him i think and maybe their dad who were in the movie with him and it looked so just
57:17
like we were here it was wild and crazy and john wayne but he was young looking he looked like he was maybe 25 or
57:23
something i don't know if people know he actually got born again before he died his daughter was present when that
57:28
happened so yes that's what his gift was his gift was making movies and yes he's making movies they have just only a
57:35
couple people present they don't need the big tracks with the big cameras and stuff they have one
57:41
thing to capture the movie the other thing creates some music that goes with it and it's watched at the time it's
57:49
being captured and you know that you're going to watch it so live action people
57:54
and there's nothing more thrilling and exciting than to get to see something like that but if a young kid or an older
58:01
man or woman whatever said man i always wanted to be an actor i just was a
58:07
desire i never got to do it do they what happens in heaven do they get an opportunity
58:12
yeah there's places actually throughout this massive theater complex it would look like it went for miles
58:19
um and it had individual theaters and i love the way the father simplifies
58:25
things for us although he he doesn't always explain how he does it we just i know he does it when you go to the
58:30
theater there are these plays sort of like a kiosk type thing and there's different movies not every movie made it
58:37
to heaven or they're making a new movie where you would have to look at the script which would be sent to you
58:44
there's so much detail i don't ever get to share about that but let me tell you you will learn the part of the script
58:50
that you're gonna do and then you will show up at the at the place at the theater where it's gonna be shown and
58:57
everybody's gonna watch it they go in these double doors you go down the hallway in another door and you are in
59:02
the movie at the location where it's being captured and if you were going to be in it you would go through that door
59:09
your family would go in the double doors to watch you perform with john wayne or whoever else was going to be in that
59:14
movie it's fantastic wow it sounds fun you know that's i don't know that i ever desire
59:21
to be an actor but that sounds kind of fun i suppose anyone could try it whether they ever wanted to be an
59:28
actor or not right they'd say i want to do that right yeah it doesn't cost anything and let me
59:34
tell you you would already be in costume when you step through that door you would be at the location it was being
59:40
captured wearing the outfit you had to have for that part uh like when i when i
59:45
was taken there and i actually walked in the halls i saw the whole thing i saw where you sign up and people were
59:51
laughing and giggling and picking up uh things that they were movies they wanted to be in and they just inform you
59:57
they'll inform you okay it's time it's not time they don't say time your event is about to happen you need to get to
1:00:02
the theater and then they would go in the spirit or somehow arrive there that's your notice that it's going to happen but you do get to practice and
1:00:09
rehearse there are times for rehearsals and stuff like that except god has a better way of producing
1:00:16
movies and a better way of showing the movies but afterwards everybody which i
1:00:21
wish we could do here i'm the type of person that likes to celebrate every special thing i enjoy life and if i go
1:00:28
see something that's good decent in all caps decent no profanity no sexuality
1:00:34
nothing like that be involved in the movie uh i like to go celebrate that i got to see it i like to talk about my
1:00:40
favorite parts in it and uh i would like i don't want to just let go home and like oh well like it never happened
1:00:46
i am a person who loves to celebrate every everything in life that brings me joy excitement
1:00:52
uh you know or uh revelation i love you that well in heaven you do that you all go out to eat
1:00:59
mass places d in the theater everybody goes and they're laughing celebrating you that you had your first movie acting
1:01:05
debut and sometimes the main person who was in it with you will come by and see you at your table and there's people out there
1:01:12
laughing at me you'll be laughing through your teeth one day when you get to heaven so it doesn't matter to me what you think
1:01:17
but there's a lot of people who are very happy that i'm given this revelation that heaven is 50
1:01:23
wonder splendor and 50 uh fun
1:01:29
and there's so much there to do i know for years i've hear people say i might be bored in eternity just mine before
1:01:35
the throne god would be bored okay and our father in heaven is not boring are
1:01:41
you kidding and neither does jesus need his holy spirit but the movie theaters is something everybody loves to see yes
1:01:46
there's more than one and yes they have many different places where they capture all these movies and the mountain of
1:01:52
spices you know in the surf park uh in the prairie in that they have a um
1:01:57
i'm telling what you call it now they have a rain forest in heaven a lot of things are made there the mansions are built into these massive trees
1:02:05
there's mansions under the crystal sea so movies are made everywhere i call them made they're captured and shown i
1:02:11
saw someone doing the sound of music literally this mother and her daughters
1:02:16
came they went sat down she went through the door and on the screen it said the sound of music but it was their mother
1:02:24
on the title page where they would show you know julie andrews made that movie on earth it showed her and so that was
1:02:30
being captured somewhere in them probably the mountain spices where they have uh mountains and stuff and they
1:02:36
were so excited watching their mother get to act and do something she's always wanted to do so
1:02:43
so you're saying it would be kind of the actual sound of music movie but
1:02:49
somehow all of the yuck was taken out of it and yeah the music was left in it so i'm thinking
1:02:56
right now of jeff who's the face that came on a few minutes ago when and he loved star wars so does he get to be in
1:03:03
a star wars movie if he wants and he can play the part he wants or what
1:03:08
the one the one hi to your dog [Laughter]
1:03:13
sometimes yeah tell us about whether you can even
1:03:19
have a star wars movie in heaven i would have to say that does not mean every single one will be shown in heaven uh
1:03:26
there's sometimes a lot of people make a good first one then after that i'm not saying star wars
1:03:31
that star wars showed a lot of truth about the spirit realm it was always good against evil um i think i applaud
1:03:40
george lucas for i'm sure that those scripts were downloaded from heaven um for him to
1:03:46
make those movies and the popularity only grew but you knew for sure there'd no be no sexual scenes
1:03:53
almost no profanity whatsoever and if there was like shooting and stuff it was usually like robots or sci-fi stuff
1:04:00
things i'm not saying it's always okay to see all of it i'm not validating everyone ever done but i did see star
1:04:06
wars one being shown in the theaters and people were playing
1:04:11
luke skywalker they were playing princess leia
1:04:17
wow well that's me so they and they can play the part i guess they can play the part yeah and i just tell people i don't mind
1:04:24
saying what i saw i hear what i saw i say what i was told i can't repeat other
1:04:30
people's stuff i can't take what they got and say this i can't if he showed it to me i'm allowed to tell you about it
1:04:36
and i did see the first star wars movie which was always good fighting evil
1:04:43
and and it's mostly family oriented stuff so i can't say every sci-fi movie was good
1:04:50
everywhere made because some of them are darker and i don't go see them myself and and i've been meaning to ask you
1:04:56
this every time we've talked about movies in heaven over the years
1:05:02
if it was good finding evil are there parts that someone plays the evil part
1:05:09
i'm not talking about with profanities some play dark v darth vader so they're they're they're
1:05:15
playing the evil character in heaven or is it replaced with some other if you've seen if you even know how to
1:05:21
answer well since i didn't see the whole movie i can't answer that question but i'm sure if they did we all should
1:05:29
know you should all know darth vader ends up by being good before he dies
1:05:35
there you go and if you if you notice the thing that always amazed me with george lucas was if somebody was taken
1:05:42
out or they died in the movie if they were a leading person if they were good you always saw their
1:05:47
spirit person like towards the end of the movie in the movie that's interesting
1:05:52
and that was actually that's like reality really and that's kind of reality because your spirit person isn't
1:05:59
dead it's very much alive and so that's one of the other things i liked about the movies was so much of it showed the
1:06:05
spirit spirit realm part but you never saw an evil person reappear in the
1:06:10
spirit probably because they were living in hell in the movie so i don't know i would think that but but you know in the
1:06:16
one it shows a lot of the destruction to the evil ones that were in the one moving evil but the people who were good
1:06:23
that died you did see them standing in the spirit smiling away waving at your
1:06:28
family on there so that's amazing you're going to find out yourself one day when you go i'm just saying he won't let any
1:06:34
evil fear a death destruction wickedness evil no witchcraft is in any movie in
1:06:41
heaven so if there's movies been made about witchcraft you're not going to see them shown in heaven so i can just
1:06:46
assure you because parents are thinking people always equate what i say about heaven to earth it's not earth
1:06:53
heaven has no form of darkness evil wickedness hate uh there's no uh graphic violence
1:07:01
of anything there's no fear or terror that's not there it's not gonna be there
1:07:07
but but god is a storyteller himself his son loved to give parables it's
1:07:13
another word for stories jesus told parables on the earth but even the father
1:07:18
would tell stories and sometimes he tells stories he made up himself to share with us he's a storyteller he
1:07:25
loves the arts holy spirit especially loves the arts and um so i can just assure you your
1:07:31
family members aren't bored in any way whatsoever it doesn't sound boring living in light light comes from your
1:07:37
spirit man so even people have light coming from them who moved to heaven you still recognize them and know them
1:07:43
though and so you just think if you belong to jesus christ you can be with your family forever and
1:07:49
even those who recently passed i want to encourage you to say they moved you don't you don't need to say you lost
1:07:55
them because they're not wrong they're not missing somewhere their body may be somewhere maybe you
1:08:02
had it cremated it's okay god said he can put the ashes back together on the day of the dead and christ will rise
1:08:08
a lot of people try to equate in their own head or try to assume things but they're living a life they never
1:08:15
could live in heaven in heaven you exist to live and your family member has joy
1:08:20
celebration they love you more now than they did before even if you argued you won't argue in heaven people will love
1:08:26
one another and um they can't wait to see you again one day but they know you need to live your life you need to go
1:08:33
forward with what god has for you and be what he called you to be on this earth that's why he sent you that's so good i
1:08:39
want to ask the question it's popping into my head so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i think it might be the lord um i
1:08:45
had a situation where there was a it was a prophet but there's been thousands i'm
1:08:50
not trying to name anybody he moved to heaven but before he did that there was things
1:08:56
that he did that weren't very good and it involved me and so i and of
1:09:02
course i've forgiven him a thousand times and i know he's in perfect bliss and but when we get to heaven
1:09:10
what will that be like will i even think of that or will i just see him and go and hug him or what what would that be
1:09:17
like if for people and their last their last connection was negative towards that with that person
1:09:24
it's not going to still be in their soul like the emotions won't be there and
1:09:29
sometimes they will apologize they'll say they'll say things like i'm sorry i hurt you and you don't even care you
1:09:35
won't care okay for you it's like it's gone you know you're so filled with life and joy
1:09:42
and people think you have no memories well you do have some memories when you go to heaven it wouldn't be kind of fun
1:09:47
if you didn't have some of your fun memories and stuff like that at the very end of the bible when jesus says that he
1:09:53
will wipe away all tears and you and the former things will be remembered no more
1:09:59
yeah those are anything any tragedies any traumas or things that happen that
1:10:05
now in heaven if you think about them it doesn't affect you at all but at one point in your existence with god he will
1:10:12
remove all of those old memories and they'll be like they never existed but i
1:10:17
want to tell people also uh we'll have to talk another time about the great the difference between the great white throne judgment and the
1:10:23
judgment seat of christ those are two different things okay and uh we won't talk about it today
1:10:29
because we don't have time enough to talk about it but those are the two different things one is for the lost
1:10:34
those the judge the great white judgment is only for the wicked uh and some people seem to think we
1:10:40
won't talk about that right now the holy spirit well you know and i i want to bring that thank you so much for that
1:10:46
we will talk about that one day i feel like there's a bunch of people out there they've looked forward to having but
1:10:53
they're kind of going if so and so is there because i've had
1:10:58
family members do this if so-and-so is there i don't even want to go i just don't even want to go if he's
1:11:05
there if she's there and yet what would you say knowing that that person is there i don't even know
1:11:12
how to ask this question but but i mean i keep sliding off my stools i mean i'm so excited i slide forward on my stool
1:11:18
so there you go so i think the question is what would you say to them how to handle
1:11:24
that now when they're feeling like you're probably if that person's in heaven i don't even want to go to heaven
1:11:30
and they'll they've said those words yeah your words are so important they
1:11:35
leave something in the atmosphere around you they will affect your own soul you don't want to do harm to your own
1:11:41
soul let alone other people's but you don't want to do something that would um
1:11:47
keep you from your full destiny and i would say this if you're saying you don't want to go to heaven because there's a person there that did
1:11:53
something wrong to you or a person you thought was wicked evil but they got saved and they're in heaven
1:11:58
you're not god number one god desires that none should perish and i'm not saying that heaven would be full
1:12:04
of everybody that's just not going to happen and some people think nobody will stay in hell if you go to hell and you live
1:12:10
in hell you're going to the lake of fire after that so you don't want to go to the other
1:12:15
place this is my point if you you're so adamant about how you feel against that
1:12:20
person and what they did against you christ was being tortured on the cross
1:12:27
you need to leave you if you're a christian you need to use him as your example you're not jesus you're never
1:12:32
going to be jesus but we're supposed to be like him and if he could say father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing
1:12:39
that he was paying a price so they would not have to live in eternity in in utter darkness or flames he's dying for those
1:12:46
people who were tormenting him and he had enough of him left in there saying forgive them father uh they don't know
1:12:54
what they're doing they don't know that they're the very one who's coming to to take the place so that they won't have to suffer they won't have to go into
1:13:00
hell uh that's why he's dying for them then you with your own will
1:13:06
leaving all of your emotions aside because your soul is made in three parts
1:13:11
you have a mind what you think about you have a will what you choose which is one of the most important parts you have
1:13:16
then you have all the emotions you display and what you're displaying is what is in your soul so what is coming out out is
1:13:24
if they go to heaven i don't even want to go there i don't want to be any way around number one you probably never even see them having so massive number
1:13:30
two is this if your if your focus is jesus christ and you can say i don't want to go there
1:13:35
because they're there what about jesus are you going to abandon him do you not want to know the father who carried you
1:13:41
inside of himself for ages before he was sent to this earth do you not care about them
1:13:47
or do you care more about making the others feel like they're so bad i don't want to be with them you need to look at it from every point of view you're
1:13:54
really literally saying to the father they're so bad and hurt me so bad i'm not going there because they're there
1:14:00
but what about the others what about your family that you do love what about jesus christ he paid a price
1:14:05
for you okay if you if you received him as your savior and he wiped away your
1:14:10
sins why are you holding grudges against somebody that is the enemy who's talking
1:14:16
to you and you're listening the first thing you should say is to yourself i don't i i know by those words
1:14:23
i spoke i don't wish evil against anybody but when you're saying you don't want to go to heaven there is only one other
1:14:30
place to go so what you're actually saying is i'm not going to heaven because they're there so i guess i'll go to hell oh no
1:14:38
you don't want to go to hell nobody loves their everyone hates everybody tortures torment torture torture torment
1:14:45
you're saying i'd rather be tormented myself in hell than be in heaven because that person made it you're literally
1:14:50
saying that so if i were you i'd loose those words out of your soul and say god i'm just going to leave that in your
1:14:57
hands and whatever you decide to do about that but i'm not missing heaven i'm not going to be i'm not missing
1:15:03
being with the god of heaven and earth i'm not going to miss being with my family who i know is already in heaven
1:15:09
so i'm gonna i'm gonna forgive the words that i spoke and loose them from my soul
1:15:15
and i'm gonna live my life knowing one day i will live with you and that other person is left to god but
1:15:20
i will tell you what you will do when you get there you will hug them and you will say i'm so glad you made it
1:15:28
because there's no darkness no fleshly man your flesh man's buried you get to
1:15:35
heaven and all you have such gratitude and joy and life can you can see it
1:15:40
pouring in and out of you the love of god and waves you're so consumed you can
1:15:45
only love everybody in heaven so don't let that one that one situation that you
1:15:51
find out they're going to have and you feel like they didn't deserve it but you didn't pay a price for their
1:15:57
life i would caution you to not stay in that place because it will affect your
1:16:03
very destiny he's not done with you on the earth you need to run your race filled with life and joy not filled with
1:16:09
that yeah that i'm not i don't want to go i don't want to even be there you don't know what you're saying you're
1:16:14
like the cross you don't know what you're saying okay whoever god says repented and he allows
1:16:22
him to be there will will be in heaven i think probably what i think more there's so many
1:16:28
possible uh scenarios that that i could represent in that what i'm thinking of
1:16:33
is in my own family um loose it from your soul yeah well i'm not even talking about me i'm talking
1:16:40
about people my sister literally feel that way yeah and she supposedly is or was saved
1:16:47
i'm not in contact with her right now because she cut cut that off but she said that
1:16:52
but there are millions and millions of such women who were molested yes i know
1:17:00
who and i know and and they've said those things and you're saying
1:17:05
when you go if you go you're going to hug that person and love that person right because you're not in
1:17:11
your flesh number one yeah people can't separate and not saying you
1:17:17
have to separate i'm saying when you get there and the way the whole atmosphere
1:17:22
like around this earth there's all kinds of wicked beings out there but there's good ones too there's angels there's hosts
1:17:29
everything is around you and and they inhabit this earth those things don't inhabit heaven
1:17:36
there is no anger there's no uh there's no um i'm trying to remember now i'm trying to remember earth words uh
1:17:47
you're not going to be um you're not going to carry a fence in heaven no there's no offense that's it
1:17:53
there is no offense it doesn't exist you can't you can't have something in you if it doesn't exist
1:17:59
so when you die in this body and your spirit man steps outside at that moment
1:18:05
you're probably beginning to say stuff because you don't feel the same when you
1:18:12
pass from this world when this body stops working and your spirit man steps out full with life and joy and
1:18:18
celebration in the very presence of the living god you can't wait to see him there's not
1:18:24
going to be other thoughts in your head their thoughts aren't going to be well what if i see them you don't even care because see you're thinking in your
1:18:30
natural mind and in your flesh you're thinking things but but when that spirit man steps out of you that is filled with
1:18:38
light and love of god because they're coming to take you home to heaven at that moment
1:18:43
you will feel totally different it won't wait till you get to heaven you'll already go filled with joy and
1:18:49
light and life you're being consumed by it and so i would say trust god no matter what you've said god forgive me i
1:18:55
said things that weren't right just use a general forgive me i said things that weren't right i want to be with you i
1:19:01
would totally say i want to be with you and what you said about the others he already knows himself if you received
1:19:07
the blood of christ and you were upset or angry or maybe maybe you were tormented he understands that too
1:19:14
but when your spirit man steps out of this body this received jesus christ you're filled with him
1:19:21
you don't have even this you won't have the emotions of anger of offense they're
1:19:26
not in you anymore they're not there so you don't you don't need this is what
1:19:31
god would say you don't be concerned about that okay you run your race with him you
1:19:37
accomplish what he has for you to do let him have that just give that to him
1:19:43
okay because jesus christ is the restorer of our soul you don't want to go around the world
1:19:49
with a damaged soul and think that you can help other people or even have ideas to invent and create
1:19:55
if you create out of a dark soul it's going to be something not good if you created a soul filled with light and
1:20:01
love of god it will be something that will be great for everybody fun for everybody or change life for people so i
1:20:08
would say choose that you know put the other thing on the shelf and say god i'm going to let you handle that and you
1:20:14
deal with me even if you say you deal with me he will get you to a place eventually where you will let him deal
1:20:22
with that but don't let your future or your right now that you're living don't let that be ruined by stuff that people
1:20:29
did to you in your past or even currently now god doesn't intend for you to live where
1:20:34
you're being abused that's not what god does not like that at all if you're in an abusive situation i would totally say
1:20:41
get in room by yourself and say i'm not receiving this accepting this i'm not tolerating this treatment anymore i'm trusting you god to get me out of this
1:20:48
situation put me in a place where i can live my life and i'm going to trust you and believe in you and you would be
1:20:54
shocked at how quickly things would start to change for you there's something you can do right now about
1:20:59
even what's happening to you now if you belong to him that is his goal but you know you have not because you asked not
1:21:06
yeah you know as we close out would you be willing to just pray for the people whatever god gives you maybe even along
1:21:12
the lines of what you're just talking about right there some people oh definitely um father i just released
1:21:17
your life yes and your presence
1:21:23
into every person watching father who's been in any situation that was abusive
1:21:29
whether it was the past whether it's present i come against all fear in them i strike
1:21:36
down that fear in jesus name i command the host of heaven to go right now to every person that is watching right now
1:21:42
you pull down strongholds of anger strongholds of abuse strongholds of fear
1:21:48
of confusion of deception right now i break that off of everybody watching
1:21:53
don't live a lie live the life of god gave you in jesus name i declare the anointing would destroy every yoke and
1:22:00
you need to say i receive that right now let the life of god fill you and consume
1:22:05
you with his plans with his love in jesus name
1:22:10
and you declare that you will no longer serve anything but the living god he holds your life in his hand and you
1:22:19
have not because you ask not you are right now asking jesus right now i want this resolved i want to be removed from
1:22:26
this abusive situation i ask you to open the doors so i can live life and live it
1:22:31
abundantly i receive that i want to live my life and run my race with you and
1:22:38
leave all the rest of it in your hands in jesus name so be it

up a conversation because of my pink hair and this thing uh a waiter was waiting on us and actually got a chair

1:24:12
his wife passing away and he was in torment and stuff outside of shell station we talked about jesus christ

1:34

1:39
of elijah list the elijah list starting in 1997 so we're in year

1:50
later but we're going gangbusters god is blessing us so much so and we do appreciate it
1:56
when you can uh sow into this ministry it helps us a great deal because we put a lot we saw a lot of that out to to
2:02
things that causes like the wells and the the medical clinic we're doubling in size in uganda so uh we thank you for
2:08
your support uh it is wednesday march 16 2022 the the date and time is on the
2:14
clock behind me uh that keeps everybody as honest as possible so they don't download this and and call something new
2:22
six months later that type of thing but anyway we're having we're going to have ken kerr here in just a moment i don't
2:27
know if there's any announcements um i don't see any uh tomorrow is amanda grace so she will be on same time same
2:34
place uh eleven o'clock and without further ado then let's bring in kat kerr
2:39
my friend kat how are you how's everybody good you know i was saying just when you sat down
2:45
we both chose to wear teal today what did you say about teal it is heaven's
2:50
number one color and a lot of people think you know well they know purple is royalty but you know i have that on too
2:56
but literally uh it's one of the father's favorite colors is teal i told people that
3:02
and the peacock feathers which i wear i used to wear a lot actually represent the living creatures in heaven they have
3:08
purple around all those eyes if you if you can look at a peacock feather it's got purple it's got this deep deep blue
3:15
it's got a little bit of teal this fine liner teal but teal is the number one band of the rainbow
3:21
that comes from him really i know you remember in the book of revelations john said i saw a rainbow like unto
3:29
it was like unto emerald because they didn't have the color teal they didn't know what to call it so he called it the
3:35
closest he could so he said emerald so everybody puts emerald around god when they paint him you know or they want to
3:42
depict him but it's actually his teal it's where that green and blue meat in the in the rainbow it kind of okay so
3:48
he wasn't saying there's emeralds he was saying it's the color that an emerald would you say
3:54
you need to catch all the key words when you read the scriptures like unto means similar to okay hey while i speaking of
4:01
catching keywords this is not on my list to ask you but before i ask you about the thing about uh what i want to know
4:08
is people are always asking what bible version do you like the best uh
4:13
well which bible versions are you studying if there's anything other than king james i think you talk about the
4:19
king james what what bible versions do you like well the king james version has always been my favorite a lot of people don't
4:26
even want to read it anymore because they think it was illegitimate but you know it was the first version put out there
4:32
actually it really was and i will say this for the king james um there's a couple things maybe they were a little
4:39
bit concerned about saying that we were made like a we were made like unto god
4:44
and that we were little gods i mean there's a lot of things that people don't understand revelation on so
4:49
in the in the different translations they kind of changed it just a little bit but i love the king james they just
4:56
put it out there that there's unicorns in heaven there are they are right about that one people there's
5:02
unicorns in heaven it's mentioned i think eight or nine times in the king james version most of the other versions
5:08
i know for sure psalms 29 psalms 92 it mentions the unicorn wow and
5:14
at one point even talks about the strength of his unicorn it even says that but they call it a rhinoceros i
5:20
mean if i was a unicorn i went like i wanted to call a rhino okay
5:25
and they said they don't understand because this isn't heaven this is a
5:30
shadow of heaven that we're living in right now on this earth he took a shadow of heaven and made the earth wow so yes
5:38
heaven is a world that's why this is a world not a flat one by the way the holy spirit laughs every time i say
5:44
not flat you know he was here when it was made right yeah so anyway i do really love
5:50
the king james version most of my main scriptures are underlined in the king james version bible i also like of
5:57
course the amplified bible which did funny scriptures i think uh really well um
6:02
also like the everyday bible uh one of my very favorites that it probably is not in print right now if you can find
6:09
one is the scofield bible it's got some of the best reference notes of any of
6:15
the bible i've seen bibles that talks about i think it
6:20
mentions in jeremiah uh where it talks about about the earth um being very very
6:26
old that it's been remade it also talks about when god turned the light out on
6:32
the earth when it was first made and then darkness was upon the face of the deep which means the first time he made
6:38
it he lit it with his glory there was no sun or moon on the year on the earth when he made it the first time he just
6:44
lit it with his glory and when satan started going around defiling it it even says in the scofield version it says
6:51
that uh satan made it a wilderness which he did he began to attack god's uh the
6:57
way he had made things and twist things and and when he was kicked out of heaven he landed on planet earth he was
7:03
supposed to land in hell by the way uh i don't know how long he stayed there but i like the king james version or the new
7:10
king james version um the everyday bible which i don't know if that's in print uh
7:15
most of mine are older versions i think scofield is uh i think you can go to amazon because i think we ordered it
7:21
last year when you said that we ordered a big old thick thing yeah yeah it's kind of got a tannish brown
7:28
tone to some of the things but yeah it's still around you can get that so oh boy i would definitely get it for references
7:34
especially yeah the scriptures it's really good you know i i've got the application that's got about nine bibles
7:41
and i just go back and forth on my computer but um you know i i like almost
7:46
every version there's some problems like i i like what um oh my gosh i can't pull
7:52
up his name brian simmons i like his bible and i love some of his explanations but some of them they don't
7:57
square with me because jesus was called the word and and brian's translators
8:03
changed it to the living expression well the word was the word so i wanted it
8:09
they actually still in the in heaven itself uh some of the hosts still call him the
8:15
word yeah he called him the lord of course host or the word and when he has
8:20
always been with god it clearly said that the word was was with god was god that was who jesus christ was
8:27
uh it didn't change who he was his name was just added on to a little bit when he came to the earth and died for us but
8:34
i think you should leave it the word that's the way to say it yeah and i want to be careful that i don't i'm not telling the people i that i don't like
8:40
brian simmons work i love his work but every translation you ever get
8:46
there's going to be something that sounded better poetically in the king james or it sounded better in the new
8:52
american standard which is very popular people don't get one that's parts of the bible yeah
8:58
some translations i don't have in front of me actually left whole scriptures out or even some books out and they keep
9:04
saying they're not done with it but you know that's been 20 years and they haven't finished it um so there's a couple versions one day we'll probably
9:11
maybe just have a have a or part of a show on all the different translations or something like might help people
9:17
but definitely i still will will stick to the king james version
9:22
for where they have shared truth about heaven they don't change what it says they don't kind of cover it up or try to
9:29
overshadow things there are unicorns in heaven you can't change that nobody can and you'll find
9:34
out when you get there anyway my uh spiritual father wade tater who's now with the lord he loved the king
9:41
james and he would always quote proverbs now watch i'm not going to get it the the but it's the part where he says
9:48
and he says this only works in the king james the other places changed it but he said i love those who love me and i will
9:54
cause them to inherit substance other places uses a different word but he
10:00
loved the substance and i wish all i wish before he had gone home i'd been able to
10:05
get ask him one more time what do you mean you know because he will he would kept going over and over that and i've
10:11
never forgotten it because you're going to inherit stuff and sometimes you know it's actually
10:17
literal wealth but it's also everything that is that god has is
10:22
substance i think he's also i think it also uh suggests spiritual
10:27
um dominion authority a substance means it's a weight it's a weighty thing it
10:34
also does mean well there's no way we can get away with that it talks about a lot of the bible we are supposed to have
10:40
wealth it says he became poor that we might be rich that's the state of
10:45
existence so and the only reason he was poor was he left heaven uh according to
10:51
heaven you know earth is definitely not on their standards as far as wealth goes but there's a difference here on the earth that being being wealthy and being
10:58
poor and we as the body of christ are supposed to be blessed beyond measure and if our soul prospers we cannot uh
11:06
there's no way that you will ever evade being wealthy and being
11:11
walking in divine health so i do love
11:17
when we first got started and kind of got into questions here but uh anything current anything uh current events that
11:23
you want to comment on before you go back into questions i think this last week and this coming
11:29
week weeks he's talking to me more about the future the uh near future than anything
11:36
else uh according to what god is saying justice has already been sent there's no
11:41
way we can um there's no way that justice is not going to be done therefore he asked me to use my gavel
11:49
justice is being served people just get a plate and dish it up because you're going to have it that's good that's good
11:57
you know and and when you talk about justice you you are you talking about both
12:05
in the secular community in the political committee and even in the church is god bringing justice even in
12:10
the church or are you talking about the world i'm talking about justice anywhere evil has been showing its ugly face
12:19
there is going to be justice done in the church because he said that he would go tweak the house of god if you want to
12:24
put in holy spirit's words uh that no one's going to escape not being put or
12:29
knowing that there's a certain path he wants us to be on and then that includes the way we live our lives but the main
12:36
justice will be not just a political world but this world will be touched by the hand of god
12:42
and the scales will tip very very heavily against all evil wickedness killing stealing cheating
12:49
lying um trying to take away our destiny our own life now and even our destiny the enemy
12:56
wants to steal our destiny the enemy our enemy is satan but all those that he
13:01
uses and right now have run to his side into the darkness the light of god is going to be shown so brightly on them
13:07
that none of them will escape coming to justice whether it's the business world the medical world uh the political world
13:14
the educational wherever it's happening that the doors are going to be ripped wide off of that and everybody will will
13:21
know what is being exposed evil will be exposed and god's presence is power and
13:26
his plans will be revealed there's a difference in exposing and revealing exposing us for the wicked and those who
13:32
have been evil revealing are the people of god who haven't stepped back and are going forward we're in acceleration
13:39
right now we're not we're no longer waiting on it is here right now and acceleration is a platform we'll all be
13:46
operating from for the next 50 years maybe a hundred years but definitely the next 50 years will be 50 years we're in
13:52
acceleration for the next 50 years that's a lot of acceleration oh my goodness does the lord show you when you
13:59
talk about the acceleration and in the future are there of course the spirit's going to be
14:05
poured out more and more and more i get that and expect that but are there does the lord show you natural um
14:13
medical cures that will become available do you see any of that when he takes you to the future
14:19
yes absolutely i do cancer will not exist on the earth at one time there'll be no cancer anywhere uh the virus he's
14:26
going to make like dust which tells me it will no longer be on the earth there'll be five major medical cures of
14:32
things that will no longer exist when he says a cure he means it won't come back there's no way it will come back
14:39
because of the glory that will begin to be poured out not just down the earth but from our own selves who've created
14:45
glory for god oh wow there's a whole these are whole different revelations you're having me try to say in one
14:51
sentence uh we don't just make glory create glory for god that's
14:56
why we're here we create glory christ in you is the hope of glory that doesn't just
15:02
mean people will see the glory or feel the glory that means we will carry it we will we will release it from ourself
15:08
like in shockwaves when we go places and the impact it will have in the in the natural world will be phenomenal
15:15
so i've been outside at night yelling a lot so i'll let you take a drink and i'm going to ask you the first question
15:21
that's good though about the very very good about the glory okay so shirley's asking this question and i'm going to
15:26
read a scripture that i i know she's basing on she didn't say the scripture but she wants to the scriptures hebrews
15:32
9 11 and uh 12 or something like that but christ came as a high priest
15:38
of the good things to come with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is not of this
15:44
creation not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood
15:50
he entered the most holy place once for all having obtained eternal redemption so
15:55
her question i know is based on that scripture and it says will you please ask cat curry if jesus
16:01
blood is still in heaven and can we see it and that begs the question did he
16:07
literally bring his blood to the location called heaven and pour it out or was that it was that
16:13
literal or was that symbolic that was literal okay the it was collected at the cross i mean
16:21
collected at the cross uh i'm not talking about people yeah i talked about the unseen of beings that were with him
16:29
the whole time he was on the cross it had to be collected it had to be poured out in heaven number one if you remember heaven had
16:36
been got had gotten not defiled but the presence of evil had been there when um
16:41
satan turned rogue and tried to take over and took one third of the angels with him to lies and deception
16:48
and uh and took away part of what was god's the blood did cleanse our sins but
16:53
also cleanse anything that had been imparted or left there it's not like god couldn't wave his hand
16:59
and say i'm taking it all away but there was major reasons why the blood had to be poured out unless he literally went
17:05
before the throne of god before his very face of god and poured out on the mercy seat i was taken to heaven
17:13
taken back to heaven at that time and i literally saw him pouring out his blood on the mercy seat and these words would
17:20
appear in the mercy seat that's a whole awesome experience that i caught up literally not dreaming wasn't
17:28
a vision i was taken there standing slightly behind him i could see exactly
17:33
what was appearing on the mercy seat and it was like hate murder uh homography
17:39
um all kinds of defilement uh every wicked evil thing you could think of appeared on that mercy seat and the last
17:46
word that appeared was death and one drop of his blood would hit that on the mercy seat and you'd hear it like
17:55
it would totally it would totally be dissolved it wasn't like it was really like hidden or covered up it dissolved
18:01
it like it never existed that is the price he paid for you every sin every sickness every disease appeared on that
18:08
mercy seat and there was silence that time in heaven while that was going on
18:13
really all the angels were on their faces on the throne room floor uh and the father was sitting on his throne
18:19
watching all of this take place uh if you remember when he told mary you know i have to go to my father and your
18:26
father he said that when he met her outside the tomb when she thought he was the gardener because he actually was
18:31
standing in the flower beds uh that's how my whole encounter started i was caught up when i was baptized in fire
18:38
and literally two angels grabbed me at the altar in my church and flew me back in time it was like i saw thousands of
18:45
lights coming towards me and when we stopped i was outside the tomb of christ he was standing in the garden
18:52
with his back to me i was staying like some near some near some trees somewhere i've been in that garden myself now i've
18:58
been i've been at that team myself but amazing that i could see mary come out and ask
19:04
she thought it was a gardener she was asking where did they take him you know where they took him but when when he said her name she knew who it was he had
19:11
glory coming out of him and he said i have to go to my father and your father well the reason he had to go was the
19:17
angels were waiting with these this urn of blood that they had taken from the cross and i got to follow them
19:24
i followed them all the way up through the heavenlies it was not my first time doing that i followed them all the way
19:29
up into the heavenlies into the throne room uh they all were by the millions waiting outside but the minute he
19:35
stepped in the throne room everybody went on their face all of the host the seraphim everybody
19:40
was on their face in the throne because here comes the lord of glory and with these with these signs of his sacrifice
19:48
and then the angel followed him up there and handed him this urn i think there's a picture of it in my first book
19:53
actually i think there's a picture of that scene where he's pouring it out on the mercy seat he destroyed once and
19:59
forever the bible says a sin sickness and disease he destroyed it with his sacrifice but you have to receive it you
20:06
have to repent i'm just add this in there for free holy spirit said you have to repent for your sins and ask him to
20:11
forgive you receive jesus christ as your savior that blood that he applied right
20:16
there on that day on the mercy seat was for you so that you could freely enter
20:22
into heaven when you left this world you could be called his and his alone
20:28
while you lived on the earth there's so many things you get from becoming a believer many people don't understand
20:33
even the mystery of that a beautiful thing but he literally did prompt that blood on the mercy seat and it's still
20:40
there and yes yes you can see it is still there okay is it like the the when you say it's there do
20:47
you mean the cup the urn is there do you mean you can see the blood on them what what do you mean it's still there i mean
20:53
you can see the blood okay the blood did not dissolve the blood dissolved the evil the all the
20:59
perversions that was dissolved but the evidence of his blood besides
21:04
the holes in his wrist yeah and the marks in his head uh that blood is
21:10
evidence it's evidence wow and is this because i don't remember that picture i
21:15
can't remember is it an urn is it like how big yeah maybe maybe you could show
21:21
the picture i will find i'll find the picture yeah that would be awesome to know and then um while you're looking for
21:27
that i wonder when you did he pour drops a drop at a time on individual sins or did
21:34
they all appear and he poured it out and they all you know what i mean or did you 100 times one at a time there's no time in
21:41
heaven so to me yeah it's hard it's really hard to understand yeah to me i
21:47
knew i was there i knew that i saw all that but there was no minutes going by there's no time in heaven they don't
21:54
have they may have one clock in heaven but it doesn't have like minutes it doesn't have like one video it doesn't
21:59
have one to twelve on it it has events on it yeah if i could find it and see
22:04
which one was that the first one or the second one jen what's in the first it should be the first one i think you could go get me
22:10
the calendar okay i actually put it in one of our calendars oh awesome
22:18
i will find it i kind of have this big recollection of seeing that but yeah i can't
22:24
that's just fascinating and one at a time so i didn't look at page numbers people i don't know nothing on the p i know what
22:30
was written on there i just don't remember the page numbers that were made for it uh but it actually he actually
22:35
here it is i got it it's not in color because my books were not made in color at the time you know i
22:41
didn't have a lot of money people uh we are going to do a version after i do the third book we're going to do a um
22:48
a special not limited edition i'll never do a limited edition um it will be a
22:54
special edition and you will have all three books together in full color all the illustrations will be done in color
23:00
so whenever that finally happens so here it is right here can you see it
23:05
yeah go a little closer because some of them have to do the father's in the middle at the top of
23:10
the throne and there's christ pouring it out of the urn on the mercy seat yeah
23:15
yeah yeah this is christ right here by my right here and there and if i'm seeing
23:21
correctly is not it's not very big i can't it's not very big the urn is not
23:26
that large right it's it looks like a small it's well you know it's bigger than his
23:32
head it's it's it probably was maybe i don't
23:37
know maybe two feet oh here we go this is much better how about this one
23:43
oh okay there you go can you see it
23:49
yeah so the wing you can see the wing with the eyes in it over here right here
23:57
that is one of the living creatures um standing um near him and that is
24:03
christ holding the urn that is carrying his blood
24:08
wow and you can see there's like a list down there you see that oh and the list is
24:14
true is that this put across the mercy seat is that what i'm yes it was it
24:19
appeared there okay on the mercy seat and he would pour on every single
24:25
that i left it running out of there so you could see that it actually was blood uh but it actually came out like a drop
24:31
at a time and hit every single one and the list kept coming
24:37
standing there that list kept coming and um and so that's actually the scene
24:42
i saw and then i sketched it and gave it to my artist and he made it
24:48
but yeah i'm guessing there must have been hundreds of different things that there were there were um of course i'm
24:55
sure that some diseases were i think it may have said disease
25:00
any disease and so but this is the wing of the living creature with the eyes in it
25:06
and they're they're pretty tall this way is this is a gem like here
25:12
so this is actually in my book because um on heaven because the father wanted
25:17
everybody to see the scene his son literally came poured his blood out that's a representation of the mercy
25:24
seat it was a little bit bigger than that but we couldn't get it on the book page so
25:30
give you an example that there was a structure there the seraphim were there on either side of him
25:36
and i know they talk about you know they talk about the one that they had on the earth down here that dave and all his
25:42
men would carry around um in heaven it's alive i have to say that
25:48
even what what's alive um the actual mercy seat
25:53
you know the one they brought into the temple where they would put the blood they would sprinkle the blood on you right right not the same one you're
25:59
seeing in the picture that's not the same one that's in heaven actually um the one in heaven have a
26:06
living it's there but it's got real angels they're not golden angels
26:12
with their wings over the mercy seat so again uh what's on earth is a shadow of what's there
26:18
so the instructions from the father to make that um the ark of the covenant
26:23
thank you holy spirit thank you for telling me what they called it what they called the ark of the covenant that they made they took in the tent of
26:30
meeting and then later into the temple uh where they would sprinkle it was in the holy of holies where that was they
26:36
would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifices on that in the temple and that's how they used to cleanse like once
26:43
excuse me once a year they would um they would do that to cleanse the sins of the people for that year and then they did
26:49
it again a year later well we know that's why they said christ paid a price once and for all yeah that they didn't
26:56
have to do the animal sacrifice anymore because christ paid the price once and for all and but he literally did sprinkle his
27:03
blood on that mercy seat that's a pretty amazing cat that's going to destroy destroy the
27:09
effects of sin and disease and hate and all these other things
27:14
defilement i mean we're all on there and he's literally pouring
27:20
human blood if i can you know because you're thinking of this blood he'd shed at the cross yeah i know
27:25
but i mean he was human what i'm saying is he his mother's through his mother's side
27:32
his humanity was there in other words it was it wasn't some spiritual blood it was the real
27:39
deal it was the real blood yeah and when you went back and uh god took you back in time
27:46
i'm guessing taking a number of other people back in time too you're s are you saying because god is
27:53
outside of time he can insert you into that moment of time
27:59
that is for you happening before your eyes it's not a replay
28:04
it's not i'm going to show you what it's like and it's going to feel like yeah i'm literally in that moment of time
28:09
when anything happened he showed me it was reality i tell people god does not work with me with um dreams
28:17
at all every now and then he'll show me a vision but most of the time it's like i guess real life uh encounter is the
28:23
only way i can say it i was literally there at the time it happened and he'd have to take me back in time but you
28:30
know he actually did do that when he hid um uh
28:36
not abraham he hid moses in the cleft of the rock and he showed him the hinder
28:41
parts that doesn't mean his back he showed him the back past times he showed him the times that had passed on earth
28:49
that's what that scripture that's revelation on that scripture which makes you fully understand that moses was such
28:55
a friend of god and that's why he got he got upset when anybody spoke against moses or made fun of what he said he
29:02
literally took moses he hid him inside of himself and took him back in time so
29:08
he could see how the earth was made he saw adam and eve in the garden i mean how could he write the books yeah write
29:14
those books if he had not seen them he could not have written them and so
29:19
that's why he said that i will show you the hinder parts or the parts behind you
29:24
yeah and when when moses appeared on the mount of transfiguration
29:30
um was this the moses that's that was in heaven that was put there or was this
29:35
moses in the cleft of the rock that was transported in the future or do you know
29:40
that was the moses who when they when he took me and showed me that he was a living he was on the earth it was when
29:45
that happened okay so he was taking control when it's happening it's when the situation god is
29:51
god isn't just over time it comes from him he didn't appear in time time comes from
29:56
him okay so that's why he's the only one people the father is the only one who
30:01
knows when his son will return to do the rapture thing not even jesus
30:07
knows when that will happen and that's in the father's hands because time comes from him he has his own
30:13
timeline in the throne room and he he he counts time by events he taught me that
30:20
a long time ago i don't count by man's monthly stuff or man's time clock
30:25
because there isn't time so how could he count it by time i know he mentions time in the bible or man wouldn't understand
30:31
it but the father literally counts time by events and on the timeline are events
30:37
and we are a long way from the tribulation the perilous times and the rapture that is not what you're
30:44
seeing right now he's not going to miss the best times on the earth with us being manifested sons and daughters
30:50
walking the power and the glory that's part of christ's reward yeah what he
30:55
paid for to see us operate like that uh he's not going to let jesus miss
31:01
seeing all and i want to i want to point out that robin your personal friends with robin and his wife
31:06
robin and robin and being you guys the men have gone fishing and the women have gone shopping and all that but robin
31:12
robin is one that speaks more of the imminent return and the eminent rapture but robin
31:18
agrees with you a hundred percent this is not that time yeah i don't know where how far ahead he thinks it is but
31:25
he said this is not that time that's why what you're seeing
31:30
and what johnny anno came forward the other day and it was was seeing the celebration in heaven and and eating of
31:36
uh was it cookies it was eating cookies you didn't see it because you don't tend to watch the broadcasts but god took him
31:43
and showed him that they were preparing cookies in heaven they were seeing the russian ukraine debacle and all that
31:49
stuff that's going on and while they were seeing that they were preparing cookies because the the the solution had
31:55
already been decided in heaven that's right that's why the father talks to me so much about the future
32:01
uh i tell people i'm from the future guess what so are you if you were in him before the earth was made and he went to
32:08
he saw the end from the beginning in the beginning from the end you lived in him when we were taken there so you're from
32:13
the future too yeah yeah that's crazy um i want to ask you a sort of an off the wall question
32:20
when because of that outside of time thing has that changed now you know i know you
32:26
do i know you're a prayer and a decree but you you you tend to do the decrees
32:31
probably primarily because i think you said that is prayer but has
32:37
being outside of time changed the way you pray the way because you
32:42
you see god in a different understanding so when your prayers
32:48
because some people think and do and absolutely fast and pray and i know you fast certain foods so they fast and fast
32:56
and fast to accomplish what god wants to do god seems to do
33:04
the celebration i have a commission yeah i i i couldn't have changed my life or the
33:10
way i i i always lived for god i always did i got born again age four and when i
33:16
received christ because i'm a seer i saw him step inside of me no man and i tried telling people they
33:23
laughed you know in the church they laughed at me and they thought i had a great imagination i went no actually uh
33:29
it really did happen then i stopped telling people but i i have seen christ so many times i stopped counting that
33:36
too and the thing is this i know that moses had a similar relationship enoch
33:42
his relationship probably way surpassed the one i had so much to the point that
33:47
god loved being with him that he took him to heaven okay well on my side he won't let me live in heaven the father
33:54
said i'm not letting letting you die you're staying on the earth as long as i want you there and i said okay that's
33:59
fine with me so one thing i don't ever think about is death i mean to me
34:05
death and life are the same if it concerns heaven if you're leaving for heaven most of the time you don't take
34:11
this body with you it's your spirit man that looks just like you is what goes to heaven one day you'll get this body back
34:17
don't cry some people don't want it back but you're going to get it back but you'll be young you'll be filled with
34:22
life okay and it'll be a powerful i do think about the day the dead in christ
34:28
shall be raised and all the graves explode open and the urns with all the ashes in it come the whirlwind comes
34:33
spinning out of that and i think it'll be one of the most exciting days on earth when that when that actually happens but
34:40
i can just say god gave me a commission and i had already sought christ for many
34:45
many years to know him more i i had set myself with that that i'm going to find
34:50
him uh i knew of him but i want to find him to know him and one day he did walk into
34:57
the wall of my home this was with christ and from that time he just does it when he feels like it and then the problem
35:04
started doing the same thing but the father always had more of my commission or a change in my
35:09
commission of what i would how i would operate for this next season which could be 10 years 50 years whatever and he
35:16
would show me in great detail so i would fully understand and not think i could go off and and you
35:22
know make a decision i never really tried to make decisions i've always been a powerful intercessor
35:28
and i did pray i didn't do the five and six hour prayers on my face
35:34
i already seen christ i knew he was real i didn't have to try to make his presence come to me but i've always been
35:42
loud even to my siblings you know my loud voice comes from standing out and calling them
35:48
home to eat dinner when they were five blocks away i think god was building up my voice to be strong i was the person who never
35:55
wanted to be seen by anybody you're known i didn't need anybody's validation because i moved twice so well even way
36:02
way back 30 40 years ago i did and i do declare and decree because the as the lord said
36:08
i want you to start decreeing he probably said that like i don't know 30 years ago start decreeing into
36:14
clearing because it will be established unto you so from that point and he said it's still prayer and this is what the
36:21
father always says to me prayer is conversation with a father son and holy spirit no
36:27
matter who you're praying you know or mentioning in your prayer you're having conversation
36:33
my conversation did change because i pray all the time because i'm speaking with
36:39
them all the time you never pray i went i never stopped praying okay that's him declaring
36:45
decreeing and then i started making rulings as a king a spiritual king on the earth he told me how to make rulings
36:52
over the darkness and it had to listen there's another whole level coming people you need to know what it is to be
36:59
a spiritual king or priest or lord unto your god but if you have a weak christian life you may not ever hear him
37:06
saying something to you he was very adamant about what was required to give my life to them it's in
37:13
the bible lay down your life and find it in him so i'm still being very scriptural i just happen to believe that
37:18
and by it and and kat you've said a couple of times on this show that at some point i don't know if there
37:25
was a moment in time but over time at least you got delivered from fear
37:30
i don't know if you had much before but you got delivered from it and is it true do i understand right that when you pray
37:36
and when you live you don't fear anything is have i heard that right
37:42
you're not afraid of anything yeah there's no fear in me how could they be fearing me if i have seen them face to
37:48
face and what they have told me is true uh and he will perform all the words that he spoke if he spoke words to you
37:56
he still has every purpose and desire and plan to perform those words maybe
38:01
not in your time frame i've learned that god uh of course is over time and people think
38:07
a lot of times i'm late sometimes he makes me do it on purpose
38:13
he does huh because i live by him i live by him and god said sometimes men may have to
38:19
change their timeline that is true though no they don't they they've gotten church service down to an
38:26
hour maybe and i have seen days when people will spend the night at the church because
38:31
the glory cloud will be there it'll be hard to make the people leave people get
38:37
over it that your pastor wants to have a two-hour meeting every now and then but when the glory begins to roll in you
38:44
won't want to be a away from that or apart from that so it's getting longer it's not going to
38:50
be shortened and as you know that profits do show up on god's exact timing it's still going
38:56
to be okay people well i love the fact that you have no fear because you and i i i used to have
39:04
all kinds of fears the more i get to know the lord the more even this thing when i say uh
39:14
even when i when i used to fear i used to fear cancer but when i started to learn about heaven
39:20
yes those things started going away because i thought okay well the worst thing that could happen is i could get cancer and
39:25
then i could die then what well then i get to go to heaven and it's like well that would be a short suffering compared to the glory
39:32
that's about to show up so i i don't have that it doesn't mean i don't i i
39:37
don't i'm not where you are by by miles and miles but i i can attest the fact that fear begins to go away the
39:44
more you know the lord so yeah it is the enemy's number one weapon and most of the time he doesn't have to
39:50
do anything to prove that fear is called unfounded fear and enemy loves to use
39:57
that if he can just he'll go and do a thought on you or put thoughts in your mind about these horrible things happen
40:02
to you just turn like satan's like there and say you're a liar i'm not going to listen to you and you'll freak him out
40:09
if you say if you answer if he tries to put fear on you you need to say something in retaliation like i serve
40:15
the living god and only the living god i don't serve you so get out now when you say those words trust me
40:22
he'll flee he will flee from you and and any demons persecuting you unless you're
40:28
out there sinning and maybe you call them but if you're not you have the right to say you're not tolerating them
40:33
and you're in your presence or around you i don't tolerate any of them it helps me that i see them or even them
40:40
trying to come they they try to come like way around me but they can't hide okay i can tell you people you get to
40:46
the place where when you begin to operate an extreme discernment and you actually will know the thoughts and
40:52
intents of people's hearts you're standing next to it helps it a lot when you're going to minister to them or
40:58
share god i say i just share god and the last three people i have shared with in random places at random times like 2 a.m
41:06
if i'm out with sometimes i'm out with my husband uh and we're getting milk somewhere because we ran out of milk i
41:12
got to have my hot chocolate people it's my source it's my number one thing i drink is my hot chocolate i only eat
41:18
once a day so you know hot chocolate's important so if he's out with me because i have to explain why i was out at 2 a.m
41:23
yeah there will be a divine appointment with somebody and there was someone who was
41:29
suffering having been on drugs for years and his wife had just and uh he was a set up by god and that
41:36
guy left changed from that well gas station because i was there at the appointed time and didn't argue with god
41:44
about going uh and so this happened in the most random places
41:49
recently but every one of them was a non-believer wow wildcat that's amazing
41:54
well okay we have some more questions and i said i would get this this week so becky and shelly
42:00
and they're both elementary school teachers this is their question can i or can we pray over our students as a watcher
42:08
and those watcher over those kids and rebuke and remove things from them like the way you explain for parents what is your advice
42:16
on that authority for the students in my care what else can i do and say over my
42:21
students besides speaking healing and exponential growth in body soul and spirit and declare their salvation now
42:27
we don't know if this is a public school or private school but it doesn't matter
42:32
and i'm not saying to have a prayer line because you'd really get in trouble uh you know there's so many things that you
42:38
can do to take authority over things and of course you do have authority you have authority given to you by the city by
42:44
the state by the parents that you've allowed your their children to be under your care
42:50
so if they're under your care you totally have the right to speak over them uh in the spirit about things in
42:55
their lives for sure you absolutely do and a parent has the greatest level of authority to speak but if if kids
43:02
parents aren't born again i would say the next person in that that family
43:07
let's say you're an aunt or an uncle to somebody and the parents of these children who you're related to uh don't
43:14
even know christ or don't care you could actually speak on their behalf as a watcher over their soul in that level
43:21
but as a teacher you absolutely were given uh care and that is your
43:26
designated position you do you can say as one of the watchers over their soul i come against any evil wickedness going
43:33
on in their home i'm not saying line the kid up and say i'm saying just say it you can say in the classroom before it
43:39
starts or you can say in your home before you leave you absolutely should be saying something like that i take
43:44
authority over satan's plans of attacks to use or abuse these children under my care and i command the host of heaven to
43:51
be posted around the school while i am there with them and to go home when one of them go home with each one of them to
43:57
watch over them to break up and crush the planes of darkness against them
44:03
when we begin to do this in the body of christ you will see major changes happening everywhere
44:08
which is one of the purposes of spirit force that i'll be teaching the first time in north carolina um but
44:15
i actually think i'm going to be probably doing wherever i go to speak this year i may say one meeting in order
44:22
to expedite at one meeting everywhere i go do you do spirit force in that one meeting so much more people can be a
44:29
part of it i will be doing it online so don't don't be concerned that you're gonna miss it the hunger you have is
44:35
what excites me but you will be learning to do stuff like i just explained and let me tell you this world is going to
44:41
experience a shift because we will be taking our place that christ appointed us to have authority in this
44:47
earth over all darkness not some of it but anything that runs in the category
44:53
of kill steal or destroy we have authority over that and you're going to learn how to take authority over that
44:59
and how to crush the plans of the enemy so good so good um and i'm gonna just say illumination has a question for me
45:05
but i don't see it illumination type it in the private chat and i'm gonna ask cat this other one um
45:12
i'm gonna skip this one because i want to get to this other one uh this person is kind of like what we're talking about the blood but this person says is there
45:18
a museum in heaven that houses all the things like tablets of the the ten
45:24
commandments tablets or the ark of i guess they mean the earthly ark of the covenant but i don't know why you'd want
45:29
to see that if you had the real one that was me noah's ark aaron's rod the king's crowns are there is there some such
45:36
thing as a museum of those things in heaven
45:41
yeah i think it's probably in the hall of heroes that they show a lot of the things that were used by these great men
45:47
and women of god people absolutely would want to and i can tell you if it's on
45:52
the earth it was made from one that symbolizes that and in heaven so those
45:58
things although they were on the earth the original original that god designed
46:04
for his own purposes would be in heaven and yes you do get to see things you can see noah's ark in heaven you probably
46:10
can write on it oh awesome yeah that'll be kind of cool um okay now
46:16
i hear she's typed this question for me i haven't pre read it but it says cat can you talk about glory clouds i've
46:22
been getting more and more of a holy spirit's presence and got a very brief open vision of what i feel like
46:28
might be a glory cloud right over my head while i was in bed i saw pink mixed
46:33
with white and i felt like it was the holy spirit so you want to comment on that
46:39
you literally can see with your human eyes the glory cloud and i i think a morning
46:45
star uh one i can't remember which one of them they used to come to new life where that was my church when i have
46:53
time to go new life christian fellowship in jacksonville florida before they had their big place up in north carolina um
47:00
morningstar would come to our church that held 5 000 people and have their big meetings they would
47:06
last 10 days and i'm telling you sometimes they played uh 24 hours a day their worship was so phenomenal at one
47:13
point the glory cloud appeared on stage you you literally could see the glory cloud
47:20
to me it looks like um it's like sort of i can't it's really hard to say but it doesn't look like
47:26
just a cloud in the sky like she saw the pink and the white mixing it's got many colors in it because it does also
47:32
represent the throne which has the the living rainbow there and so to me it's
47:37
like these little pieces that continually turn in this cloud so minuscule if you weren't aware you
47:43
wouldn't necessarily see each individual on making up the cloud but there's all kinds of colors in that cloud and it
47:49
appeared over the drum set on stage and i know i think it was was
47:56
it susie jen uh who was part of morningstar's worship she dove while she
48:01
was on the stage dope into the cloud oh really it was one of the most powerful meanings they had it was during one of
48:07
their times when they were here creating a new worship cd uh but it literally manifested on the
48:14
stage i i've seen many versions of the glory cloud or sizes of the glory cloud
48:20
but at one point on this earth which is why we're not going anywhere uh at one point there will be angels
48:26
holding open the door of the sanctuary and when you go in the glory cloud will already be there
48:32
okay this is on the earth and this earth that we're standing on right now the glory car will be there i was taken
48:38
forward in time and i saw this uh i also saw some armed gunmen trying to go in
48:43
there to they were going to take everybody out in there and god said he actually said watch what
48:48
happens i was forward in time and when they grabbed the handles they had these massive guns they were going to go in
48:54
and to shoot everybody their hands froze to the doors and begin to melt
49:00
oh my goodness really i mean the guns they were holding these huge
49:05
guns began to melt to these these were going to murder them these terrorist bodies they began to melt to their
49:11
bodies their hands were melting that they were screaming so loud uh when the rescue and the police came they didn't
49:18
they cut the door down they had to haul them all off all and all together just to remove them and god said i will
49:24
protect my beloved and at one point it will be very dangerous to come against anybody he's following me believing in
49:30
me or allowing my presence to manifest so i'm telling you we're entering into these powerful days i'm at really
49:36
powerful days god said in the past you died to bring me glory but in these days you will live
49:43
and live and live to bring me glory so if you're alive right now you're appointed under special things and to be
49:50
great for god yeah yeah one day i'll tell the story i won't do it today but i mean there are people
49:56
that are not on this earth anymore who came against me i'm talking about 30 40 years
50:02
ago and i was following christ and i would our our spiritual life was alive we had a lot of a long way to go to grow to
50:09
where we are now but god removed some people from this earth and i had forgotten about it and because he had
50:15
done something special for me and i said god i can't even believe you did that and he said i've been doing that for you
50:20
for years and he began to highlight the people that suddenly are down there oh man if that's what happened when the
50:26
glory was just small 40 years ago what are we all
50:31
about to see and i didn't know that he took me inside another sanctuary and they actually had
50:37
a sign right in their foyer when you came into this one church it said enter in do not enter in unworthy or you may
50:44
not come out you may be dropped
50:50
this is something that will really literally happen he shows me the reality of truth i don't have um i don't have
50:57
just uh maybe something that represents symbolic he doesn't show me things symbolically he shows me literally what
51:03
is real what really will happen you have to remember he gives me the mind of an eight-year-old so it has to be something
51:08
an eight-year-old could share really understand this is what will happen and so there will be a whole new all
51:16
which is probably lacking in many sanctuaries will be such an awe over the name of god his person i mean father son
51:23
and holy spirit the triune godhead that we set you all because of the powerful manifestations that will be happening in
51:30
the earth people will run make sure you get their sunday and get your little special seat because you may not have
51:35
one one day when the world begins to show up well and that's and you're describing too you know
51:42
ananias and sapphira was a one-time event as far as we know but those days are coming back in in mass aren't they
51:49
in mass they are coming in mass because of the amount of revelation people will have in
51:54
the earth that they fully understand or have been shown this is who he is he
52:00
really is who he says he is and do not mock him do not dumb don't don't uh
52:06
don't speak wicked evil things over him or what he's planning he won't randomly just kill anybody he's not going to do
52:13
that but those who have an evil heart who lied to him on purpose or lying in front of other people they may have a
52:19
really hard time convincing him not to take them out yeah and you know johnny you know this
52:26
is not your you're called to different ministries but johnny has and several of them had
52:31
said we're coming into a time of great great great exposure even in the church amanda talks about the amanda grace um
52:39
but usually there they don't take it beyond exposure exposure exposure
52:44
but if ananias and sapphira days are returning it might be exposure slash death to some people
52:52
that have resisted his calling i mean is that are you seeing that kind of thing then
52:58
i am i'm not saying in every single sanctuary it'll happen but it will happen in different places and it is
53:03
because of what is god bringing to the earth that's never been here before to
53:08
walk in levels of authority and dominion that he's giving to us uh because we're
53:13
supposed to we're actually they were given this by christ but the revelation of how to operate and all of that that
53:19
you will speak to the land the sea and the air with his anointing and knowing his purposes and plans and you walk in
53:25
his ways he'll tell you to speak to something and it's going to happen and it will be known that you did that but
53:31
they'll know who's got who what god that you serve that you did who's name
53:37
days these are powerful days and i'm not saying that in a small way
53:42
and that's why he had to show you all evil where it was the wickedness and the
53:48
evil what hell's plans were using man because you know the devil's always done
53:53
that but this time it's going to fail it's going to fail yeah it will be totally bad okay that's good
53:59
that's good i i was supposed to say too that that person asked that question about uh
54:05
the glory cloud that they saw they wondered if it was a glory cloud uh there that was green lantern in 345 i
54:11
don't have a name um illumination centered in but when she said i was in that bed and i saw these
54:17
did you say that was the glory or those that was the holy spirit do you do you sense what she was seeing i think
54:24
it probably was a part of the glory or some of the glory because the glory cloud of god well the glory is known by
54:31
light okay the fire is known by fire baptism and fire you will see fire you
54:37
will experience fire i have had a measure of baptism and fire it was all about fire and it came into me like a
54:43
blow torch literally wiped everything off the walls of my soul
54:48
anything that maybe i saw or heard that wasn't my choice uh it wiped all of it
54:53
off and it made me even bolder than i am now when that happens so when the full measure comes you're not going to walk
54:59
away the same just like the people in the book of acts they got they got holy spirit and they got baptism in fire
55:06
and that's what it does to you it makes you bold if you were never bowed before they didn't care who saw them if they
55:11
heard them speaking about god that's what's going to happen when that begins to happen so that's the fire the glory
55:18
is a totally different thing it's still a part of the image of christ the image of the father and even holy spirit will
55:25
will come in bands or a whirlwind to fire himself so these are things coming from the throne the glory the fire
55:32
the power is uh if you realize even what you say when you talk to them
55:38
uh honor our glory of power you don't even realize you're saying things that exist in heaven that are something that
55:44
have substance something of the substance that that he was talking about when he said that i'll bring you the
55:51
substance of god yeah oh that's good yeah that's by the way that that's helpful to get that um clarification of
55:57
the substance so um i just want to let's see um let's we have time for one more maybe
56:03
a second it says i've heard cat say several times that there are body parts in heaven my question is how do we pray
56:09
for these body parts to be given um to our loved ones and ourselves that need them and i'm going to add a
56:14
question to that at the same time so we just i'm going to throw in mine with that and that is are these but if
56:20
there's a right arm is that right arm for steve one day that's going to need it or is that right arm for anyone
56:26
that's going to need a right arm how does that work and how do you pray for um i think that whatever body parts you
56:33
are lacking or that aren't working properly i have seen i i didn't know that arms were designated for certain
56:39
people however i was in a service where an angel came down with a gift box and
56:44
walked through a man who was due for heart surgery he walked in that man's body and left a new heart in that man's
56:52
body that was a service we had at new life christian fellowship where they had like
56:57
three hours of worship and at the minute after the three hours of worship there was this big crack and the staircase
57:03
literally came down from heaven into the uh the sanctuary and angels began to run
57:10
down with all these boxes uh because at the point i heard this loud crack nobody else heard the crack
57:16
but me um they always had me sitting on the front row with a sketch pad so i could sketch anything i was seeing in the
57:21
spirit run that's a really awesome journal sketch pad i have but they and then our pastor said shout out what
57:29
you need from jesus right now right now we've seeded the heavenlies with our worship with our decorations right now
57:35
yell out what you want and this man yelled out i want a new heart and the angels begin running down with all these
57:42
gift boxes so your body part comes in the gift box people wow right through you with it and it's put
57:48
right in the place it needs to be it will be just the size you need to match the rest of your body i know that part i
57:56
know that happens and this man uh gave a testimony in the past said tomorrow night we're having like a
58:03
a long testimony service and the man actually went to the doctor who had just scanned his heart and they scheduled him
58:09
for the surgery looked at him and said where did you get the new heart you you couldn't this could not have happened i saw your heart
58:15
we've got we've got mris and x-rays and no you don't have this heart in you and the guy greenlee said i got last night
58:21
in the church service well that's fine that is that so so
58:26
that's cool so you they seated they seated uh heaven with their praise
58:32
and worship and god basically said i can't help myself anymore i'm going to send healing is it kind of i don't know
58:39
what what guides the bowls were full or however god saw there were thousands of people in those
58:45
services okay for that one purpose to reach god to to just to love god to reach him to
58:52
manifest their love for him and gratefulness for him and there wasn't like continual prayer
58:58
asking through the whole service they were just worshiping him with abandon that they loved him and they they were
59:04
blessing him and then when the pastor said stand up now when he said that i saw jesus standing behind him which is
59:10
all in my my my thing i drew i gave it to the pastor later but jesus appeared and then then the pastor who didn't see
59:16
him because he was behind him stood up and yelled uh jesus is here yell to him and tell him what you need
59:22
and people were like i want my divorce decree cancelled i need a new car i need a new house i need this
59:28
they were yelling out and those people got the things that they cried out for so i can tell you god has different
59:34
reasons and purposes why he sends them i absolutely do know this at some time in the future they will
59:41
empty this is how great it's going to be people so this we're not anywhere near the end we're at the beginning of the
59:48
great great great days on the earth and i just know a hundred and some years into the future i'm quite sure all this
59:54
will be going on and uh but there'll be a point in that time when the empty the body parts
59:59
warehouse because nobody will need body parts after this time of glory on the earth i also can just sew this in for
1:00:06
free i do know the antichrist will not be able to appear until we
1:00:11
who walk in the glory who love jesus christ that bride he's waiting for with no sin and no flesh around us operating
1:00:18
in the earth as as just the humans we are with the glory uh the antichrist will not be able to appear until we're
1:00:25
taken out because the earth won't need him when the enterprise comes they'll be broken burn up they'll be desperate uh
1:00:32
for someone to come and help them that's not going to happen because jesus christ
1:00:37
who is who is the king of kings and lord of lords will be so manifest by our lives in the earth that there won't be a
1:00:44
need for the antichrist at that time so that's a long ways away people don't plan to get on your rapture rug and get
1:00:50
out of here i tell people get your crown on but i can just say this god does have a plan and whether you understand what's
1:00:58
been going on full exposure has to happen in order to clean that platform
1:01:03
and put on there who god wants for us to operate uh without any con you know
1:01:08
anyone coming against us or abusing us as believers in this earth so that's the days we're going in
1:01:15
and on that to kind of wrap up that this last this show and the clarification on that question that she wanted to know
1:01:21
well how do i pray for body parts for my loved ones and you actually may be given the clue but you said they worship for
1:01:27
three hours and no you don't have no worship it's it's more of a declaration
1:01:33
a decree and god said that whatever you do to declare decree it shall
1:01:38
doesn't say maybe it shall be established unto you and i i i do that a
1:01:44
lot that's that is my prayer life and i'll just present it before the lord say father come before your son and i
1:01:49
present this before you that i declare and decree that this this thing that's been happening to this person this will
1:01:55
stop in jesus name that you will give them justice that they you will fulfill what they need i just did that the other
1:02:01
day when one of my family members who actually helped me to pay for my first book he helped he
1:02:08
bought he paid for my first book to be published or i would not have had it and i have i stood in the gaffering because
1:02:13
he was really not in a good way and overnight it changed
1:02:18
wow so you got to go home the next day so you declare in the creeks so and even this person
1:02:25
without his years on the years of me blessed be on measure because of what he had done for me it's like bringing god into remembrance
1:02:32
he says bring me into remembrance you know especially if it's people who've done things for you or whom you love or
1:02:38
who have been servants or helped you can actually say that i know they can say it's going before the courtrooms of
1:02:44
heaven i just go straight to the throne standing in the gap for this person i
1:02:50
gave his name i said i'm reminding you this is what he has done on my behalf
1:02:55
and so many others that's really good and so i'm standing in the gap you said to bring in to remember so i am so i'm
1:03:01
asking you uh to bless me to let him live and not die let him
1:03:08
rapid rapid re restoration his body and then he'll be able to leave and he won't die in the
1:03:14
hospital somewhere he'll be fulfilled to see the glory and the blessings you have for him in this earth and the next day
1:03:21
he was all right that's crazy well yeah and that you said yourself father is staying in the gap for let's just say my
1:03:28
sister you know her arm is damaged or it's not working right i stand in the gap for her you put me in her in our
1:03:34
family to love to be a part of so i'm standing in the gap that she will her arm will be restored or you'll give her
1:03:40
a brand new one however you desire to do that i thank you for doing that in jesus name amen
1:03:46
that's a declaration that he will establish unto you i can't say it'll happen overnight i'm just
1:03:52
saying those words you just spoke will be re received in heaven god will not ignore
1:03:59
those words he will write it down and what happens is whenever whenever it is
1:04:04
whatever it is his choice or time that requisition you just gave will go
1:04:09
to the body parts warehouse it will be sent to the back they'll take that arm put it in a gift box and i know you're
1:04:15
thinking you're pitching a human arm it's just flopping around you know a spiritual arm at that point right
1:04:22
in the spirit but you can see it and they would deliver it walk through your sister's body if this was the plan and
1:04:29
then she would have it immediately and i've heard of testimonies way back in the days right when people before people
1:04:35
got new feet they got new legs and some of the revivals that were happening back then we're about to see major
1:04:42
major divine healings and let me tell you if you say that you want it whole there's a
1:04:49
difference in whole and healed by the way like the lepers who were healed and went
1:04:55
away with missing body parts but healed the one came back to guess what thank him and he was made whole like it never
1:05:02
happened in other words any body parts that were missing they were put back on him because of his gratefulness for the
1:05:07
healing so always declare you want them made whole i always say i want to make whole i want
1:05:13
them made whole like it never happened like it never was it's your level of faith because things
1:05:19
are done by faith you're showing your faith to god when you do that that's so good yeah and i was thinking
1:05:25
even before the cross the jewish people who may not have ever followed him but they said
1:05:31
this centurion i think it was he built our synagogue and that's how we want you to help him because he built our
1:05:37
synagogue that's all jesus needed was their gratitude for someone to give him
1:05:42
permission or whatever you would say encouragement he doesn't he he he really
1:05:48
responds to gratitude didn't he you know he really does he does respond to gratitude and i remember probably like
1:05:54
20 years ago the lord came in and talked to me and said um
1:05:59
it would bless us if our people were more they were grateful he said gratitude is sorely missing in
1:06:06
the body of christ and to to thank god to thank his son for sacrifice but thank god for that you're
1:06:13
alive he's given you this life in the earth at this time to do things for him but also to walk in love to show people
1:06:19
his character uh he put us here for a reason but how wonderful i know you
1:06:25
celebrate people's birthdays and you know anniversaries and stuff how about just celebrating the fact that they gave
1:06:32
you life and chose to bring you here to to carry the glory for for them and to be here for them
1:06:38
i i bought a plaque that said be grateful every day and i actually put it on my wall
1:06:43
and i thank him for almost everything that comes into my life i think just that
1:06:49
alone would will definitely draw the eyes of god to you that's interesting yeah that's good
1:06:54
yeah and this year too i've discovered that i've been doing you know i live on 20 acres he lived here for 22 years old
1:07:00
farmhouse you've been here one time yes but you know i was thanking him
1:07:06
this morning i said you know what lord i this has never gotten old i have never
1:07:11
stopped loving this property but i don't tell him that all the time but i said i'm you know sorry for not telling you
1:07:17
every day but this is i'm so grateful you know in 20 acres there's a lot of corners to this property or places that
1:07:23
i haven't even been to it's 20 acres is pretty large yeah it's i haven't even begun to
1:07:30
explore the possibilities in this property in 22 years so anyway i'm very very grateful and i i you know i sense
1:07:36
his smile i don't yeah i didn't you know i didn't feel anything at that moment but i sensed his smile and i'm doing
1:07:42
that i know it pleases him when we do that i guarantee you you're going to please the heart of god
1:07:47
uh i know we want to bless like i spoke earlier you want to bless people that you love and help people you don't know
1:07:54
which also blesses the heart of god but even letting him know that you're thankful you're like well he can see me
1:08:01
yes but words mean so much to him i mean he wrote wrote up the tablets of stone
1:08:06
he had the word of god written words are important god always writes things down in journals and and all kinds of books
1:08:13
himself so i think um sometimes i would tell people just write a card to him oh
1:08:18
nice that's that's good just write a card somewhere in your house and say god i want you to read this card it tells
1:08:24
you how much i feel about you i'm telling you he'll be down there getting pictures of that card
1:08:30
that's good that's really good wow that's that's a good practical thing that's that's more than a prophetic act
1:08:36
that's an act that's it yeah well cat uh i guess that's their time
1:08:41
tell people what they can get at your two websites and um revealing heavens on the screen revealing heaven.com yeah
1:08:48
revealingheaven.com is where we have our our events which were finally hopefully
1:08:54
we've been so busy packing a lot of other things we've been just kind of waiting to get done but we are definitely still in
1:09:00
transition to move from here into actual home the offices will be here for a
1:09:05
while but we are already looking for an office building then our studio will be here for a while so we'll still be here
1:09:12
in and out of this place for some time but um revealingheaven.com is where you find out the events it's where you buy
1:09:18
stuff on our store and i always show the cup this cup that i love i don't do demons
1:09:23
you know that was the holy spirit's quote with the lightning bolt and we actually have some kids cups i'm
1:09:28
just going to show it it's a winter scene from heaven in here uh those are cute we still have some of those left if
1:09:35
you're interested but god wants us to flood the marketplace with heaven and it's only beginning
1:09:41
uh with the things he's gonna have us do about that and my other website is
1:09:46
catker.com it's the only place in the whole world that you could give to me online
1:09:52
if you don't like sending things to the mail believe it or not we still get a lot of mail and i'm grateful for people and i know that
1:09:59
you are so grateful for the people who support you i know people the the salvation is free
1:10:05
but anything you do in the work of god it is going to cost you money because you will need supplies you'll need a
1:10:11
building you'll need staff to do things even pastors and churches i know people say well they shouldn't have charged for
1:10:18
me to come and get the the gospel is free but they have staff they have to pay they have no they to have the church
1:10:25
there's maintenance that has to be done i mean i i know those things exist so
1:10:30
that so be grateful to god when you go someplace give something in the offering to help them to do more and of course
1:10:37
always bless those that you're receiving from i always uh put in a plug for steve because steve has uh a job from heaven
1:10:45
he has a commission from heaven to give a platform for the true prophet of god to speak
1:10:50
or the true prophetic to speak of god's behalf so steve is important if you want
1:10:55
to bless god bless steve i'll just say that very kind and i'm very grateful for everything people give to me but just
1:11:01
hang on because it's going to get wilder and wilder on the good side on the god side
1:11:07
and you'll be some of the the people who have such a story to tell in the future
1:11:12
of the greatness of god and what he did for our nation and for this world and that the way they will live their life
1:11:19
is changing but the evil and the wickedness will be diminished crushed down pushed back or just go to
1:11:25
prison that's good yeah cat we love you very much we and your

1:35
hello welcome to catker day it's wednesday march 23 2022 yet we've named
1:42
it cat cur day and uh it's gonna be great uh dealing with questions about heaven for any of you who are new and
1:48
don't know about that cat's had many thousands of trips to heaven that's one of the gifts she has it happens all the
1:54
time so we're going to ask her about anything she might have to say about current events and then we'll go into
2:00
more questions but put your questions uh either put it in reply or go to
2:07
the comments underneath youtube or on facebook we kind of try and audit those and get the most common questions that
2:13
people are asking we don't repeat a lot of them questions that have already been answered but we
2:18
do repeat some if you go to the clip channel at our channels tab from youtube
2:24
you will find um 50 60. i don't know how many there's a lot of a lot of episodes
2:29
and there's lots and lots of clips where we say the question what the question is that cat answers and then we just cut
2:35
that to short things so you can get your questions answered just by going through that it says over 200 clips of cat
2:42
questions so paul thank you for that so all right as and it is com do it in the comments
2:48
section on all your platforms we we audit those and look for unique questions that have not yet been
2:55
asked about heaven and i don't think we would ever actually run out of questions because everyone's got a different angle
3:01
in their question but anyway hey without further ado let's bring in cat kerr here welcome to cat curtain cat
3:08
hi there good to see you good to see you kat um
3:14
so uh now tell us about that logo that's right at the top there what tell tell us what that logo is that you
3:21
put right in the center right yeah that is our spirit force logo
3:27
that represents the new mentoring that i'll be doing all year long so if you didn't get to come to north carolina
3:33
don't worry we'll have so many sessions of that some in person some online
3:38
so that um you will get to hear about it it is represents revelation on what it
3:45
is to be in the army of god not talking about heaven's army this is the one on earth this is us it's the
3:51
body of christ and it won't change you people left change forever from those meetings
3:57
very much empowered about what they can do on their own uh not just about what's going on right
4:03
now in our country but for the rest of their life how to take authority and do and use
4:09
every weapon god's given us as the body of christ it also brings us together in unity and you can even do this if you
4:16
want to do spirit force you can do it with friends you can do online with other people yourself it's uh
4:23
it's um very i guess portable i guess i don't want to say no
4:28
know what to say but uh it can be used anywhere anytime in the world by any believer so it was really life-changing
4:35
for people and i loved it i got to wear my commander cat to camera right oh i
4:40
have to see that you have to i wore my military outfit which was not normal kind of for me
4:46
yeah we are gonna make we're gonna it's one of the fashion lines we will make some spirit force fashion
4:52
and put it on our website for everybody to have and i do want to remind people that um
4:59
when i have an event myself in my own city or i go somewhere and rent a place
5:04
myself there'll never be a charge to come to my meetings but if i'm invited by another person
5:11
or a ministry to come that's up to them if they charge because if i come they
5:16
have to have extra security extra ushers extra clean up people uh extra everybody if i come in in their
5:25
in their place doubles you have to understand that the gospel is free which i've always told people
5:31
but when you go to events somebody paid for something i mean it cost for more electricity for
5:36
more parking attendance if you've got hundreds of extra people coming in and i'm on their side i understand but god
5:43
just told me i personally cannot charge for any of my own events that are in my own venues
5:50
some people misunderstood that they didn't know why they had to pay ten dollars ten bucks that's a burger and fries
5:56
people and you get a life change that was for them to help pay for all the extra people and things they had to get
6:02
there and it was certainly worth it but they just misunderstood so if it's my own venue that i'm having
6:10
and i'm advertising and you're coming to my my place here the places we we get here in jacksonville we we will never
6:17
charge you to come and so just please understand that why they have to do that if they're getting
6:22
pushed with all these extra people and they haven't had people for registration i could just go on
6:28
children's church workers i mean if the kids are there so just hang in there it's going to be okay
6:34
yeah what whatever they do and i say yes to that they'll let me say whatever god wants me to say which is the best part
6:40
and so but it was very very powerful the meanings were powerful and i'm going to really enjoy doing spirit force and even
6:47
as i'm speaking about it and training people he shows me more about that yeah so that's what this this is a logo
6:55
god gave me actually on purpose on the fake inauguration day
7:01
january 21st 2020 i think is that when it was and that was probably the 20th but i don't
7:07
know maybe 21. that's right okay okay and and on that day on purpose during
7:13
the fake during the fake inauguration from the stolen election god downloaded
7:19
spirit force in me to be one of the ways that we can come against the enemy trying to do stuff and let me tell you
7:24
it will begin to change things in your own life first and i i love the humor of god
7:31
also in operating in the power of god but his humor he could have done any day but chose that day on purpose that's
7:37
good by the way one more comment about you know for 25 years we've been doing this and when we do conferences we would
7:42
because we'd fly them we'd have to pay to fly in the speakers because you can't invite someone to go and then make them
7:47
pay their own way it doesn't make any sense so we we do that but then people would write and say this gospel is supposed to
7:53
be free and i would write back and say you know if you go to a christian bookstore and you buy a christian book or a christian
7:59
bible or christian music you know you're going to pay it for it and sometimes for very expensive prices and your nobody
8:05
thinks anything about it because this is a bookstore and it's the same thing people wherever people gather or
8:11
congregate and there's class and flying in you kind of sometimes you just have to charge them that's no they have to
8:17
stand for any event it doesn't matter what event it is unless it's a free one
8:22
but your city is putting on i mean then they charge but if you go to a game if you go to a movie if you go to a theater
8:28
show you're paying for that because they have expenses and it costs to you know to put
8:34
that on to enjoy so you shouldn't expect anything different
8:39
really it's an event there's a lot of expenses and you're just helping in a small way to pay that
8:45
and i'm just blessed that there are people who are excited enough and and want people to have revelation yeah and
8:53
he invite me by the way i and this is a pardon me while i do this quick little rabbit
8:58
trail but you know the lord revealed to me once i thought well yeah it's right there in the word isn't it
9:03
judas carried around the money bags where did the money come from that was putting people would come and decide to
9:09
donate they would have to he carried it with them they would have come to jesus or the disciples and say i want to give to this where do you put it they would
9:16
say well here judas got the money back you know however you know so they weren't charging for it of course but
9:21
people wanted to willingly give into it so that was important remember he did feed people most of the time he fed the
9:28
crowds sometimes he did it by multiplying the food sometimes they went out and bought the food oh really
9:34
in the bible well i didn't know that i didn't know that they sometimes paid for it wow they did because one time they said when they
9:41
when they had the crowd and um i think it may have been the time he did multiply the food but the disciples said
9:46
there's no place we can buy food you know for these people that's true yeah jesus when he put on
9:54
when he put on a meeting he did it right but most of the time he did feed the crowds wow wow that's amazing there you
10:02
go people there you go there you go well listen cat we'll jump what we always open with is if there's anything you
10:08
have to say but these times are getting really exciting and tense and amazing and the the mainstream
10:14
media is freaking out more and more uh because there there's a
10:20
a bullseye put on what some of the things that they're saying but what would you like to say about anything current
10:26
i do have to anytime i find something i'm allowed to share i'm going to share it and if you all will remember i have
10:33
been saying there'll come a time when the news media themself you know there
10:38
is news media there's big newspapers and run all over the country and there's other ways that they put out the news
10:45
besides just these you know the the networks that we used to watch it on uh
10:50
there's many other sources even sources online now there's networks there's uh programs there's news media online
10:58
well once again one of the traditional secular
11:03
news media sources have finally opened their mouths to tell the truth in writing the new york times people
11:12
really that used to be a huge supporter of the left and what they wanted to do until
11:18
they have found they're beginning to find out it's not so good after all they actually did post in the new york times
11:26
about the whole um uh biden son thing in the computer that that that is true that
11:32
it was all scandal that was planned that it was criminal activity so it's in the
11:38
new york times
11:45
say that and this was actually posted by a legitimate source that really knew
11:51
what they were saying so i don't know what day they did it but if you want to go search up the new york times and put in there probably the buying laptop i'm
11:58
not sure what they call the whole thing it's like the buying laptop yeah yeah or criminal activity whatever they
12:04
called it but yes it has been found out that is true that there is um criminal
12:09
activity going on in in in in that in the biden thing with his son and so they've gotten more uh
12:16
now there's even more people investigating that whole thing and they're what's happening is they're
12:22
digging up more stuff as they're finding that part we're like okay if that was a lie all along what else was a lie
12:29
exactly exactly and as i have said before there are people who didn't have their soul compromised by the fake news for
12:36
like six years or four years they actually kept their own mind and made decisions uh to choose liberalism and
12:43
other stuff but they're realizing now if we don't do something the whole
12:48
country is going to be taken away from us and they themselves who were supporting
12:53
financially and by putting not true things in their paper they're realizing
12:59
if we don't stop and start exposing we'll have nothing because you know that person who's doing
13:06
all this the bee person doesn't care who fails who loses i mean
13:11
and they're not i keep saying this they're not making bad decisions on their choices they're on purpose
13:18
choosing yes exactly this is strategic right now they're using to take our
13:23
country away that is what their plan is that's their plot and plan that's why they want to put evil things in or evil
13:30
regulations make their own laws without any voting being done what do you think they're doing yeah i know it sounds like
13:36
they don't have a lot of brains in their head right now i get to like to be really honest okay
13:42
uh but they're planning no matter who's controlling that's their plan who's allowing it and
13:48
agreeing with it and going along with it they're all guilty but i can tell you there's there's a few
13:55
networks now every now and then fox will say something or somebody on fox whether it's hannity or someone else will
14:01
actually tell you truth that's going on but more and more it's going to be people like newsmax or right side or
14:07
whatever online they'll always they'll always tell the truth about things and there's even more there's whole networks
14:14
like we said there would be being formed and launched news networks
14:20
online some are christians some are secular and they're going to start to rise up because people know they can
14:26
trust what they're saying they'll be saying just the opposite of all the others but the other ones are losing and i keep saying people and it's
14:33
not hidden either i will just say this uh cnn has lost 30 of the viewership
14:41
and that's in black and white that's in traditional newspapers that's been said on other news channels so it's not just
14:47
me saying that it's already been that's already been released thirty percent of the viewership that's gonna hurt your
14:52
pocketbook people that's gonna hurt your account that you run things with and if they keep they said that they can't they
14:58
cannot this is it they can't decide to say something new and i've noticed when i travel overseas
15:05
they'll ask me what's wrong with your news people they're not mine they're stuck in a ditch with their soul
15:11
compromised and they they've lied so much they believe it their self they can't stop saying what they're saying
15:19
because they themselves have been deceived that is what is wrong it's whatever's in your soul is going to come
15:25
out and until their soul changes they're not going to be able to change but so that is the legal those are real
15:32
numbers that have been put out uh in the newspapers out over the air that they've lost 30 percent of their
15:38
viewership because they can't stop saying what they're saying and people are tired of not getting news yeah yeah
15:44
their viewership is crumbling fox was our go-to for so long that we stopped watching fox unless you watch tucker
15:51
carlson i think is the most pure voice that i've seen the hannity sometimes his reports on the left once in a while but
15:58
uh he's close to being trusted and and tucker who's probably the most trusted voice on fox this is my opinion
16:06
but even i've even seen um i hate to say it but i've even seen newsmax begin to report deep state stuff about what's
16:12
really going on in ukraine yeah they're reporting what the deep state wants it to report and for all of our
16:20
viewers and friends of yours this is getting to be a place where you not only hear the word of the lord as it's
16:26
revealed but you hear true stories about what's really going on uh it's gonna it's getting to be kind of a trusted
16:32
news source not that we set out to do it that way but what kept you said i think that was
16:37
god's plan though yeah i think it was and so once in a while we'll tell you
16:42
uh some something that's true you know one of the things that if you see suddenly someone capitulate like new
16:48
york times a lot of times they're doing it because they know something's about to blow there's they've they've got
16:54
inside information something's a blow about to blow up in their face so they rush in there and say well we want to tell you that we now know that the
17:00
hunter biden thing was false yeah you're right but they do know this too
17:07
they are truly news people and if they find out there's really truth leaking by
17:13
by bonafide sources that know what they're saying and these
17:18
may be regular people who gave them tips before and now they've just been ignoring them all sometimes there's some
17:24
you just can't ignore and you're right they don't want to be left behind if this blows on some other big network or
17:31
a newspaper they want to make sure they're out there so they wouldn't be saying it if it was
17:38
not true so i can let you know the truth is going to come out and no one's going to stop that from happening and it won't
17:44
be over uh i'm not saying things won't begin to change drastically for us they
17:50
will before that probably does end because it may take a while to um bring
17:55
justice in every area against every person but it is going to happen okay
18:00
there you go that's my exciting times as men will like to say these are glory days not gloomy days and
18:06
i think that's right you know you know it's we we got to get to the transition and sometimes the transition is painful
18:12
someone wrote me today and said well not almost everybody one of your guests
18:17
agree and they mentioned you and they agree and they agree and they talked about how they're being encouraged and someone
18:22
said that they were freaking out because the uh they needed to quickly buy gold because the you know the rapture was
18:28
short time away and the only way to survive is to have gold and i'm thinking it might not hurt to have gold but but i
18:35
i wrote her a nice long letter that will probably copy to anyone else that has that same objection
18:40
you know i have a little bit of gold i have a little bit of silver but you know that's not going to save you the lord is
18:46
going to save you if we have three weeks of um the chain you know the
18:52
what do we call it the something chain uh anyway i can't think of the name of it but it's got the word my head
18:57
knowledge isn't working very well yeah but it's like when the food the food chain and the you know the the truck
19:03
chain and all that there's a better word for it but someone will write it down the supply chain thank you illumination
19:08
the supply chain if it gets if there's two or three weeks where it's tough and make sure you keep your gas up there and
19:15
you're grocery stocked well well it's good because maybe we'll have two or three weeks of a tough time but that's not
19:21
gonna bring the rapture because we have three weeks of uh you know food shortage
19:27
it doesn't look anything like it's going to win that time i can promise you that this is right before right before almost
19:35
any time in the bible when god was going to do something powerful the enemy always acted up and no matter what
19:41
source satan used to try to do all this uh taking away or stopping things from
19:46
happening it never worked back then and it's not going to work right now because he only gets a few short years at the
19:52
end of all this and we're a long ways away from that happening we have not even begun to see the glory of god the
19:59
baptism and fire manifested sons and daughters speaking to the land sea and the air and it's doing something
20:05
immediately that's that's just starting to begin in those days so god has to
20:10
clean the slate people and push back darkness so we can operate freely
20:16
freely in power and authority ourselves speaking and changing things which is
20:22
operating in the kingdom that jesus always talked about you barely you've heard him talking about the kingdom but
20:27
we've barely been operating it trust me because the way he talked about it that would be it be a major game changer
20:34
to be in the kingdom and in every area of your life it's going to change as we understand that and start doing it
20:42
it will make a major difference in this physical world so good so good well kat let's get into
20:48
some questions about heaven or related to heaven i have one that's partially personal
20:54
but it has to do with what you've talked about let me ask you several questions about that but you talked about the welcome
21:00
center in heaven that people go to here's my question so uh we used to say we lost so and so and
21:06
we're learning that not to say we lost a dream um saw her brother go home saw but her
21:13
brother went home to be with the lord this week so he has two brothers and the oldest one would went home to be the lord now he loved the lord very much
21:21
i had kind of a tough life because he'd been in the accident that dream was in when she was six years old and the
21:26
parents were killed so he'll go up there to see the priest the first one to see her parents but so he his particular
21:32
theology of this denomination is he absolutely believed in his heart of hearts
21:37
that he would lay in the grave everything that was him body mind soul all of it would lay there if it was a
21:43
hundred years it would later for a hundred years he would not go to heaven until the resurrection so
21:49
he went home last week we know he went home so when he shows up at the welcome
21:54
center does he go and realizes that he's ahead of all of the rest of us we're not there does he does he go wait what or
22:02
does it do is it so changed that he never even realizes what how does that oh no he's going to go yes
22:08
[Laughter] i did get to go oh my goodness they were right that's what he's going to say then
22:15
he's going to run over the place trying to see as much as he can see and then someone say come on we'll show you all about it and then lead him into the
22:22
welcome center that you really see like a big scope of heaven itself which which answers so many questions already of
22:29
what is actually there and what you get to do and uh and how you do things with family or you meet
22:36
family from your family line 500 years ago i mean there's so much you can consider even people knowing yes those
22:42
mansions will have a beautiful place we'll get the fellowship together it's going to be great it's so beyond that and that's why the
22:50
bible says eye has not seen nor ear heard and this is the part i like nor enter into the mind of man
22:58
so there's things up there you never even thought or considered would or could be there and i think those are the
23:04
things that really people are like they're not afraid at all and they're not really even upset they're like
23:11
delighted and amazed that there is so much more there than they even dreamed of and it's all
23:17
god it's all good i mean there's just so much fun and excitement and adventure and
23:23
and so you go in the welcome center which i still love god's sense of humor it's run by people uh that actually own
23:30
funeral homes the heart of family i don't mind even saying it i've heard you the hardest family in our city to own
23:36
funeral homes and richard hardick who was like the head he was in the father there was a father and many brothers
23:42
like six or seven brothers and you knew they all were in the same family and they went to our church of the big
23:49
church we used to go to when we first came here to florida and they were kind and they would they would always get
23:55
people at ease it was a gift and god said he gave them a gift to comfort people to make them understand it's
24:01
going to be okay and they just said that that's this was the way they all were so they all ran
24:07
this whole line of funeral homes here and i actually had the pleasure of giving a word from god to richard
24:14
hardage and he was probably about to pass two months after that himself and said he'd never gotten a word from
24:20
god in his life and he god maybe he said this whole family operated in excellence
24:26
their funeral homes operated in excellence in every way so richard will get his word in excellence and he made
24:32
me get a parchment scroll and write it in gold ink
24:37
and then they had to attach these beautiful things uh on the scroll so it looked like one not maybe
24:45
not anything like what you get in heaven but if they give you a scroll in heaven it's embellished it talks i mean now i
24:50
didn't speak but it did give god's word to him for and he actually told richard this is what you'll be doing in heaven
24:57
when you get there and how many people get that word this is what your family's doing mentions his brothers their names
25:03
um and why he chose them and i think the humor of the lord is
25:09
that um he did he did say one funny thing in this scroll that made richard
25:14
he was standing on the sidewalk outside of his home his funeral home he was visiting going to visit
25:21
um and i just god told me to go at that time and there he was on the sidewalk and he knew he
25:26
knew me he didn't know it was a prophet but he knew me from my family and i told him he was undone but the funny thing he
25:33
said to richard then he says this is to be a delightful place you'll bring such comfort to the people who don't know
25:38
what's going on there'll be a psalm like is this heaven this is amazing why are they dancing why are they singing people
25:45
are like eating there's food appearing in the air and they're flying on color and they're like
25:50
you know they're undone although you feel the presence of god and they see the throne and they see the river of
25:55
life so he said you will be able to comfort them you will be operating the welcome
26:00
center in heaven he said you used to get them when they were going to heaven you
26:06
will now get them when they're coming to heaven so beautiful so beautiful i mean
26:12
yeah they had they had to be the see their people their the people that they loved to serve but they saw them on
26:18
their darkest darkest dark you're right you're right so they were they're going to have comfort the minute they're
26:24
touching comfort flu in them and excitement started going in them instead so they leave so excited then
26:31
they can really not wait to to get out there and where they got to go to the throne first and be welcomed by the
26:36
father and jesus walks them up the steps of the throne and they're so thrilled
26:43
that guess what they didn't have to stay in their own body because your soul and your spirit don't sleep
26:49
so that would be like sticking you in a casket away yeah that's what it would be like if that happened because your spirit man's
26:56
awake all the time so is your soul where are you stuck in a box you do nothing i know it says to be absent from the
27:03
body that's your spirit man it's gonna be present with the lord and we all know
27:08
he is in heaven so that scripture shows you right there uh you're not gonna sleep in your in your body the bodies of
27:15
what decays and or or gets you know a cremated which is okay if you want to have that done you can put every other
27:22
ashes back together he can he is going to raise that body up one day your spirit man will go back into your body
27:28
and explode out of that grave or out of the urn or wherever it is i think that'd be one of the greatest days to be here
27:35
if you were on earth it would be great to see all this happening around you and then because the people in heaven
27:41
get to get their body first people yeah and that's very very cool if you're still here you're standing in
27:46
your natural body i better take a drink just a minute yeah i was a quick a quick pointer note is that
27:53
when i was raised but bruce dreams brother doreen and i had that same exact belief that's the way we were raised we
28:00
thought you're laying the grave that's it because there were certain scriptures they pointed but they never had an
28:05
answer for if you have to be absent from the bodies to be present with the lord it's very very very very clear
28:13
you know but somehow they this one other scripture made them swing everything over this way so i was such a to me
28:21
um i would just encourage people that happen to be raised like that that you go to be with the lord and it would be
28:27
good and i asked them this question if you knew you went to be with the lord instead of laid in the grave would that
28:33
be good news and i asked that question most people say well yeah be good news but i don't believe it but would it be
28:39
good news yeah well yeah they don't want to believe it they just feel like they have to when i tell
28:44
people you're gonna find out one day anyway it doesn't matter what they're saying you'll just find out when it
28:49
happens to you and you will be happy i had a question about because when you first talked about the welcome
28:55
center i'm seeing this quaint little building with the welcome center but the reality is it has to be a hundred
29:01
thousand people joining coming to that center a day i would think have you seen the size of it at home
29:07
glorious heaven divine supernatural architecture
29:13
where the buildings are speaking to you and making music before you ever get up there the glory of god's blinding out of
29:20
every one of these doorways there's no door there's not a door there's arches that you just walk into this beautiful
29:26
place engulfed in his presence before you ever get to the throne room you're so undone at that point it's okay with
29:34
you're okay with anything you know so that would that would remove any kind of confusion right there so no it is very
29:40
it's a very beautiful building it's got lights in it it's got colors coming out of it it looks almost
29:46
iridescent and yet it's solid at the same time so i have a question about
29:53
there and maybe you may or may not know this kind of a the answer this kind of question but
29:59
anyone that's a child whether they're in india uh hindu india or buddhist
30:04
china or whatever anyone that's a child goes to be with the lord is that right when they die it's absolutely true
30:11
they all children and babies they all go to heaven every single one of them go to
30:17
heaven so i don't know if you've ever seen some of them were never taught about a jesus
30:22
or jesus they would have never heard the gospel so i don't know what what that would
30:28
seem like they they're dying of aids or whatever starvation in some of these countries
30:33
so they don't even know that there's a future for them some of these kids right jesus is the first one that meets them
30:41
they already know who he is before they ever get to heaven wow amazing well okay i have a next
30:48
question here um this is pat asks this question he says when you've said we are with the father before he
30:55
sends us to the earth in others we were in him is it just our spirit that is with him
31:01
or is it or is it our spirit and soul they're trying to figure out how this thing works
31:06
and i want to add to that this whole since we're talking about what's
31:11
what's in there with the father does he tell us
31:17
um what we're about to experience does he tell us the way the life will be that it'll be hard
31:23
if he knows that or does he is it a blank slate and the soul has never been
31:30
told what's what the future holds i don't know how to ask that question but go ahead and i do know there's many
31:36
different things that happen in this and he does talk to us he does he talks he talks to everybody but everyone who ever
31:42
was is in there you know if they haven't been born yet they're still in him so you're talking about probably
31:48
billions of spirits still little spirits you're a little spiritual being
31:53
and they're not all the same size i mean some are real tiny some are a little bit bigger and you get a little shift thing
32:00
to wear and uh it's a little outfit clothing music clothing really and yeah
32:06
but you don't look necessarily like you yet because the physical body is what
32:12
gives you your your physical identity your physical body does but god knows
32:17
every one of us he knows the plans he has for us it says every day of your life was written written in a book or
32:22
squirrel before he sent you here and so he did know things that he would go through but he knew the great things he
32:28
had for you and when you go to heaven he's going to give that to you and you will actually see
32:33
and like i said there's no regret so i know in your natural mind right now you're thinking well i'll be sad if i
32:39
find out i could have had that or i could have done that i'll be upset no you won't it's not like that what god is
32:45
showing you is the goodness he always had planned for you but we do have a devil on this earth who hates everybody
32:51
who wants to take away whatever he can take from us or get us on the wrong path and yet god
32:57
stays as much as he can with you to guide you you may not have had the best parents on
33:04
the earth but again everybody makes choices you make choices your whole life and maybe made some wrong choices but
33:10
when you get to having you be so delighted and love jesus christ and love
33:15
the father and love holy spirit that none of that stuff from the past can touch you or affect you at all but as
33:22
far as being the little spirits inside of him it's very uh i think the best
33:27
explanation i can give is when he made adam when adam was made you have a soul you wouldn't be a whole
33:34
thing okay your spirit and your soul are like one they're two different parts of you your spirit man is uh is the the
33:42
carrier of your soul and it's really the way you have to say it because your soul is one of the most important parts of
33:49
you your spirit man is important or you wouldn't be able to have a way for your soul to be transported around
33:54
but you couldn't decide am i gonna as a little tiny spirit you could you have a few things you decide
34:00
but you weren't living outside of god in heaven somewhere you didn't have to decide who am i gonna go visit today
34:05
what am i going to go eat today you didn't have to eat when you lived in him he was your life
34:11
and it says in him you live you move you have your very being and everybody thinks it's talking about
34:17
jesus but it's actually the father we lived in the father we didn't live inside jesus christ okay we lived in the
34:24
father and he carried us until he decided to make this physical earth
34:29
he made the earth for really one reason so we could have a body that's the way he designed all of it that you wouldn't
34:36
be forever inside of him you would then be your own person you got to make your own choices so yeah you had your soul
34:43
you could decide am i going to run up the hill to listen to him his powerful hill is
34:48
it talks about the hill inside of him his holy hill am i going to swim in the river of life i'm going to jump in the
34:54
bins of the rainbow i'm going to ride them outside you could ride outside of god then back in you can even see them
34:59
doing that if you're ever before the throne really even jessie saw that jesse the planet saw that a little girl who
35:05
was caught up to heaven saw that she caught them fireflies because your spirit man is made out of light
35:11
so you did have a few choices you could make but your soul was kind of inactive so when he made adam let's just not add
35:19
him yeah it was adam yeah there's correcting me my my natural brain is still trying to reconnect after
35:24
sharing spirit forces for several days when went back in genesis you can go
35:30
look at yourself when when god made adam god i usually say god that's the father
35:36
jesus who was called the word would step out of the father and the father would say a word in the word which is also
35:44
jesus made the body of adam and it was perfectly made it was laying there i
35:50
know people have other more versions or detailed versions of it but basically the word made him and he was lying there
35:57
he had no life in him the body that was just the body that was laying there and the father
36:03
because he carries all the spirits remember leans over and breathes adam's
36:08
specific spirit of life that was his little spiritual being breathed into adam's nostrils where there was no life
36:15
breathed his spirit man adam's spirit man in his nostrils into his body and it
36:21
said adam became a living soul now why would he say that because his
36:28
soul was then alive it wasn't dormant okay and your soul is what makes your decisions it's your mind your will and
36:34
your emotions your soul is you or he wouldn't call adam a living soul in other words from that day forward adam
36:41
had to make his own choices and choose what he was going to do what he was going to say where he was going
36:47
to go so we lived inside the father until it was time for us to be here on the ears
36:53
and then he would send us and and at the time of conception at
36:58
conception not later on when you're being born that's a lie from the left people okay
37:05
when you're at the time of conception the holy spirit brings your little spirit of life from the father and knits
37:12
and attaches you to that diet of flesh in the womb
37:17
the scripture says i knit you together in the womb
37:23
true think well that means he puts his arm in his legs on no he knit you you're a little spiritual man oh i see i see
37:31
what i mean yeah i thought i honestly thought it must have been referring to your arms and legs and you know no okay no because
37:39
man can't make a spirit man can't make a spirit no man made our
37:46
spirit that came from the father where he lived so at the time of conception when that takes place
37:52
that's when life begins when conception takes place and that
37:58
thing really happens that spirit of life is brought from the father by holy spirit he goes in the womb and attaches
38:05
you so i guess you don't go back to heaven attaches your little spirit to that dot of flesh and as your body grows
38:12
in the mother it that that spirit man adapts to that fleshly appearance to
38:18
your body that's good and then you are a person and then when you're born so you're still you in the
38:25
womb it's you you were sent from the father that little spirit man was attached to that god of flesh and as the
38:31
baby grows in the womb not some other thing your spirit man grows right along with
38:38
your body and then the baby even as a baby can hear things said to it while they're in the womb it likes when the
38:45
baby's born sometimes they like a particular music if you played it while you were carrying that baby if you play
38:50
special music that music will come for that baby after it's born because it's accustomed it knows your voice it knows
38:57
the voice of the mother because as they're carrying the baby it can hear a lot of mothers trust me i did it i spoke
39:03
to my baby all the time in the womb total couldn't wait to see it that i was going to love it it would be a part of
39:09
our lives and that's the way every baby that's the experience every baby should have when it's in the womb
39:15
but life begins at conception and what is birthed
39:20
eight or nine months later whenever that happens is a human being it's a living soul with a living soul in it and babies
39:28
learn as they grow to make choices their cell so that's how that whole thing happens
39:33
you lived in the father in him you lived you moved you can move in and out on the
39:39
rays of the rainbow you couldn't go any further then you'd ride back in and that you we all enjoy doing that or
39:45
you play in the river of life you jump on the stones of fire that's why we like sparkly things because god had them
39:51
inside of him the father did so you just had uh you really had the big picture
39:56
about you that's where you came from that's where you were first in heaven inside the father then he sent you to
40:02
this earth to do something for him to be here for him and to know him have you seen any any specifics like
40:10
it's transition time it's time for you to come out of the father and to be sent to the earth at that moment i guess of
40:16
conception that's the moment you go is there a send-off does he say i'm
40:22
giving it to this mom and dad or are you suddenly there what do you mean because they're they're aware that
40:28
they're not in him anymore obviously they're aware it's not like they're asleep your spirit man doesn't sleep
40:34
actually and within him i mean there was no time where god had a break because we didn't take naps when i've seen inside
40:41
the father several times and saw them playing and laughing together and i would also see him put his hand down and
40:49
someone climb in he'd bring them out and talk to them while he's getting on the throne he'd say i've chosen you to be
40:54
this or to do this but you'll have to choose it later in your life because he was writing it down so he knew what i'd
41:01
be doing when i was in him he knew where i'd go he knew the parents that having you the choices uh praying the choices
41:08
what would happen but he does know what you will become of what he has pushed this is the thing he does he writes the
41:15
thing he does do steve before he sends you to be knit together to your mother he writes on your soul
41:22
oh really male or female really
41:27
yes because he knows which one you will become he's been from the beginning to the end and the end of the beginning he
41:34
knows what you're going to become male or female so that's why there's so much conflict when someone tries to change
41:42
that what that god has called them to be and puts all the body parts on them to be
41:47
male or female if they try to twist that and be something else your soul will always have conflict with you
41:54
and i literally have talked to homosexuals before who got born again i've talked to some who aren't and they
42:00
say they always their soul and they call this all my soul is always in conflict
42:05
with me so something is not right yeah and i did read uh someone i led
42:11
them over the phone years ago to know jesus christ when i showed them i would read parts of the word how they lived in
42:17
him how he sent them how they got their spirit man that he has to purpose them and it says in the body he made them
42:23
male or female it doesn't say you get to be a third thing okay that's the devil's plan to
42:30
twist your identity so you will not become what god wants
42:35
you to become and they feel like if we can do that we'll steal the destiny that's what that's all about it's not
42:42
your mind making decisions that is satan twisting who god made you to be
42:47
so you would do great things for him or help humanity and they know that the satan knows if i can get them off on
42:53
another path is totally opposite they'll never be a threat to him the same might be who god wants him to
43:00
be and i might as well add this for free i did see a day on the earth when millions of
43:06
homosexuals would have the blinders removed and they would run to be a part of the kingdom they would
43:11
run to be born again in mass but to jesus christ awesome awesome awesome you know and on that all
43:18
the whole thing about knitting in the womb i'm thinking the more and more and more the young women older women
43:25
some who have had abortions the more and more that they see what really happened the less will have abortions and
43:31
probably i don't know the conviction of what happened to some and they'll repent for the first time
43:38
when they hear this summer probably repenting now because they didn't realize this when they had an abortion my heart of compassion goes out to them
43:44
because they didn't mean to be murderers in their minds they convinced themselves
43:50
that this was those things some of them were forced yeah i mean they were forced if they were
43:55
young especially their parents would force them thinking they were doing the best thing and any time i have meetings almost
44:01
anywhere i will mention that and they do get born again and then i tell them name your babies that are in heaven they know
44:08
at that point i've done it in book signings this one lady had five abortions and i just god will tell me
44:14
talk about this when i'm at my book table signing books and i start talking she started crying and weeping she said
44:20
i'm receiving jesus christ right now in this moment not receiving christ and i said well your babies are probably
44:25
allowed to watch you receive christ because now they know that their mother will become heaven they'll be celebrating and she said right at that
44:33
table this is the crazy thing the day that happened and people started running inside the
44:39
bookstore i've got uh the spirit of god on me right now come and see what's in the sky
44:44
really over the bookstore was this gold cloud it was not a normal cloud all the
44:51
clouds in the sky it was still like daylight this cloud was glorious gold
44:57
and you could see little images i didn't we didn't know who they were i figured they probably were the babies little
45:03
images like five little images and an angel there it was just crazy i
45:09
think somewhere i have a picture of it if i could find a picture and i was telling where that is that was a long time ago that's like in
45:15
2008 or seven or something like probably eight 2008 but that woman at that moment
45:20
realized she had babies in heaven she wanted those babies she wrote me later
45:25
and thanked me for that and she said i i've actually picked all the names of the names i picked i've had plaques put
45:31
on the wall saying these are my children and and she had other children told them about the children that they had
45:38
siblings in heaven so it majorly changes people's lives when they realize that wasn't nothing totally
45:44
yeah saying what the devil does do the devil will beat them up for the rest of the life i was going to say that because
45:50
he didn't talk to her or somebody did he'll try to beat him up the whole rest of the life that they did yeah i was
45:55
going to say that because people think well god because he knows it's killing a baby he's angry no it's the devil that's
46:02
beating you up it's god that's wooing you to realize what happened yeah we can restore you and your body yeah
46:08
he loves you love he loves you and he loves those babies in heaven he wants those babies to have that have their
46:14
mother or their mother and father if you know who that is but they didn't just it stopped existing
46:20
and let me tell you the second they stepped out of that little body jesus was there to meet them their own angel
46:27
who comes at the time of conception their own angels are already there with them and they'll carry them home many
46:32
times jesus meets them in heaven right away and then he'll sit down and he'll hold them and love them and talk to them
46:39
and later they grow slowly i do know this also later on uh not that they have
46:45
to but later on they have a ceremony in heaven where all the little babies will bring flowers and they will sit on the
46:50
lap of christ and receive them as their savior even those are already in heaven really really they want to they want to
46:57
do that so they receive him as their savior even though they've already
47:02
arrived in you know not paradise is not the technical name for it but they've they've arrived in heaven oh that's
47:08
right that's very interesting well i have a question for you and that a few minutes ago you said jesus stepped out
47:16
of the father and then i think he was regarding adam and he created i don't remember exactly how i said but
47:21
many times you said the father decides what's to be made and then jesus steps out and makes it so the question is
47:29
does god create things or does he only make decisions and jesus is the only
47:34
creator because i've only heard you talk about jesus as the creator and the scripture says there's nothing made that
47:40
has been made except it was made by jesus so what what's your what do you got what's your understanding because the word was with god and was god and
47:47
there's nothing that was not made that was not that was not made by the word they did it together but the reason why
47:54
his name was the word was because they would go somewhere jesus would step in the word would step
48:00
inside the father he'd go where there was nothing and the father would stand there and say something the word stepped out and made
48:07
it they have almost always worked together in what they did and you realize even
48:13
back in genesis 2 when it said the spirit of god hovered over the water so the holy spirit is also involved and
48:19
that's why they're called the triumph god head they can step inside of each other that's why they're the three in one
48:27
okay they're not just they don't stay that way but they have the ability to do that so whenever creation something's
48:32
going to be created the father just lets the word make it that's what he does
48:38
and so the word made everything that was ever made but he went by what the father said he stepped out and made his words
48:45
that he spoke that's so good now um i want to ask this next question and
48:50
you had mentioned that there were some little spirits and some bigger spirits and it made me think of this question which was
48:57
actually next to my list anyway this steffi asks um and i'd like to
49:02
experience what it's like to be tall i've been short since i was a child can we change
49:08
some some of those dimensions height and all of that in heaven well i would just say this you know
49:15
jesus himself can be as high or small as he wants to the father if
49:20
you have to say he said we're made in their image and we operate like they do that's why he made us so eventually in
49:26
heaven you can be as tall as you want you can be as short as you want lesson i remember a little girl you're not just
49:33
stuck in something it's always going to be you you'll just be tall or short or whatever but i remember a little girl
49:38
asked me one time a question she said i want to ask god a question when i get to having can i have a
49:44
conversation with an a can i be as small as an aunt and before she could even finish it the father said tell her i
49:49
said yes she can be the size of an if she wants to and she can have conversations with him
49:55
all the time she wants to and then she can go right back to being herself so he answered that
50:00
uh for that little girl and i do know yeah people can be tall for a while they can be short but it's still going to be
50:06
you um people can do all kinds of things in heaven they you do fly i haven't really
50:12
openly said that anybody can fly in heaven you have a place where you learn though you do get to learn you go by this place
50:19
called flyby near the amusement park and you learn how to fly because you know he wouldn't just throw you out there and
50:25
say go for it um there's no telling what you wouldn't get hurt but and people say can i have
50:31
wings that's another question can i have wings well he might let you have some for a while but you wouldn't know what to do with the wings either you think oh
50:37
some things you don't automatically know uh and i think that um there are those
50:42
who were on the air that actually train you how to do that and then you can fly around the amusement park or whatever so and i do
50:49
know i guess if you really want to have wings i don't know why he wouldn't let you have them probably for a while or maybe that would be a fun experience
50:57
but how are you going to put your clothes on with wings how would you walk through the door if
51:02
you turned around you knocked people over um wings are not little tiny baby wings
51:08
people they're like eight foot ten foot if you're five and a half foot you can have like eight foot wings
51:14
and you don't need them i think it would be a fun thing to watch people have wings and walk around but you don't
51:21
need wings to fly but people probably want wings because they want to fly but you can fly without wings right so yes
51:27
you can so okay ah what was i going to ask you um
51:33
okay i said i did this one okay uh
51:39
this question i almost didn't ask it because okay but it's not my question so i'm
51:45
going to ask you because it's her question lenta is the name kat mentioned she was taken back to the
51:50
tomb when jesus rose from the dead my question is did jesus know that cat
51:56
was there watching the scene he's timeless was it possible that he saw a cat witnessing the moment so i don't
52:02
know what kind of uh i'm i'm perfectly sure that he knew
52:08
that i was there really really i'm sure he knew yeah he was well the
52:13
reason i say this because i've heard because i've heard bobby connor say he was at the crucif he bobby was at the
52:19
entire crucifixion so there must be thousands of people who god has shown maybe that's wrong this kind of
52:25
experience that happened i think there are probably many people and people just are afraid to talk about i think they're
52:31
nuts but he he chooses and picks where he takes me because i'm going to share it he only
52:38
shows me what he wants me to share and i'm pretty sure jesus didn't take
52:43
time and i was back in time i wasn't in this now time when i saw that it wasn't
52:48
a dream it wasn't a vision it wasn't um uh whatever else they have those things they call i was literally carried back
52:55
in time when it actually happened and i saw mary come out of the tomb i i
53:00
know what she thought he was a gardener because he was standing in the flower beds jesus loved flowers but you have to
53:07
remember on the cross he was in his physical body when i saw him he was in his glorified
53:14
body that was a little different okay say that again say that two
53:19
sentences again when he saw him on the cross he was in his physical body hanging on the cross right
53:26
when i saw christ he was in his glorified resurrected body was his glorified body it wasn't just his
53:33
physical body that got taken out it was glorified it says he was the first to be glorified in the
53:41
he was the first bible yeah he was my body when he walked this earth he was still in his human body his
53:47
spirit man i mean it was still him and he could work miracles
53:52
but he didn't have his glorified body yet the glory he carried on the inside was now on the outside which is also one of
53:59
the reasons why she had a little bit maybe not quite sure i mean the light was coming out of him everywhere when i
54:04
saw him he was already out of the tomb but that was his glorified body now because he is a witness that's a
54:12
testimonial witness he keeps his scars on purpose to search oh yes
54:18
but we in our glorified bodies when you go to heaven you won't have scars on your spirit man there are no scars on
54:24
your spirit being at all yeah i don't want any scars just don't have them that was your flesh that had them and i'm not
54:30
sure uh in our glorified bodies i can't see why we would want scars or anybody would want something missing off of them
54:37
i know your body is whole completely whole and in perfect shape and young again um
54:43
uh you'll be young through all eternity nobody's going to be old but jesus when i saw him was in his glorified body so i
54:51
have a question about that because i when i was raised i think they i think i was taught that you know they mary tried
54:58
to you know hold the jesus back and he said don't detain me or don't keep me here because i've not yet ascended to
55:04
the father and i think someone i think the teaching was he had to go to the father and be glorified
55:09
but you're saying he was already glorified yes so it was the thing to the father
55:16
did they have a massive ceremony of celebration uh is that when he poured his blood out is that what he
55:23
had to send to the father and pour out his blood his blood was presented as the evidence yeah
55:29
uh but he already had the glory on him okay uh when we're when one day when we
55:36
are all raised from the dead that means our spirit man if you're living in heaven you're being
55:42
your spirit man and that spirit man will be joined back together to that body and
55:47
instantly glorified you can never sin you can never be sick you can never leave christ for all eternity you are in
55:55
the glory the glory is wrapped around you and in you and you'll have light coming out of you
56:00
like i saw coming out of christ so um yeah those are whole different different
56:06
times in our life that we will experience things but but i do know that christ when i saw
56:12
him now i have to say i saw him in his spiritual body i've seen him many times
56:17
since all that happened i've seen him a lot uh since all that happened but i did see
56:23
him when he was in um paradise i was taken back and showing him in paradise in his spiritual body his physical body
56:30
was in the tomb so his spiritual body was wonderful i mean uh he he had the light of life uh
56:39
in his face and he was speaking to all those who were in paradise that's who he preached the gospel to they were they
56:45
were held captive there they were held captive in paradise in other words they couldn't leave there
56:51
they didn't have the ability to just go up to heaven then or anywhere they lived in that beautiful place called paradise
56:56
or abraham's bosom it's the same place and jesus in his spiritual man preached the gospel to them in his spiritual body
57:04
and then he crossed over to hell still in his spiritual body and so uh when all that was all done
57:09
that time was over the three days were over in hell that his spiritual body rose up through hell
57:16
picked up his physical body and it was glorified at that moment so from that moment
57:23
nobody would have been able to attack christ number one they couldn't appear so they couldn't hurt him they could have done nothing to him at that time he
57:29
was in his glorified body he had to go back to heaven to present the blood that was collected by the angels it was
57:35
collected by the angels and it had been poured out on the mercy seat before the throne of god to show the father here it
57:43
is this is why i went here it is for all time he had the ability to forgive sins for those who repented and the blood is
57:50
the evidence and of course i had a huge celebration but i didn't stay i didn't get to stay
57:55
for the celebration that was all going on when that part was done and the throat the floor opened
58:02
before the throne and everybody's looking down they can hear satan screaming and yelling of
58:09
putting his fist in the air screaming no because he had just been defeated wiped
58:14
out all the gemstones stripped off of him how doesn't the grave taken away from
58:20
him by the son of god wow in his spiritual body taken away from him he
58:25
was defeated before every demon and they knew that christ won they knew
58:30
it they knew christ won that was one show that christ put on and he made a show of it openly it says so in
58:36
colossians he's spoiled and ruined principalities and powers the highest level there is in hell they don't live
58:44
in hell they're on thrones around the world ruling the evil and he stripped
58:49
everything uh he stripped away and ruined their features by melting them i've heard you talk about it i have a
58:55
question too some are teaching or have taught maybe it's correct but i i've never really sat
59:01
in the teaching that when christ died he said on the cross it's finished there are other people then that would say he
59:08
went into hell and had to experience that did he have to experience anything or was it done done done when he went
59:13
well i can i totally know exactly what the answer to that question is okay it was finished
59:20
for the salvation of sins okay that was finished okay
59:25
that part was done when he died and his blood was poured out and he died when he said it is finished he meant the
59:32
sacrifice was finished and from that moment on he could forgive sins for anyone who repented there was something
59:38
else he had to do he had to go take the authority back that adam gave away
59:44
okay see did you suffer in any of that god was different that that was a sacrifice of himself right as being god
59:51
who died for shed his blood that was finished okay knowing for all time could take that right away from him
59:59
or stop that from happening there was one more thing he had to do and that was to go into hell and take away from satan
1:00:06
the authority that adam had given him adam gave him authority by choosing what this what satan said to him in the
1:00:13
garden and everything changed for adam they couldn't live in the garden where everything was freely given to them they
1:00:20
were in the presence of god walking with him that ended because they chose to the deception they chose to lie
1:00:27
that changed everything so jesus had to go into hell and take away the
1:00:34
keys of hell death and the grave he had to take all the glory off of satan that he still wore that was the gemstones and
1:00:41
according to ezekiel 28 go read ezekiel 28 people and you will hear about it when when god
1:00:48
said when god was speaking and he said had said that he would walk upon satan used to walk upon the stones
1:00:54
of fire that was inside the father those are inside the father lucifer used to step inside the father
1:01:00
and lead worship from inside him when it was he was the anointed one he
1:01:06
was anointed to step into the father to lead worship every angel in heaven could not just step into the father
1:01:14
and the father is the one who has a rainbow coming in and out of him jesus doesn't have the rainbow coming in and
1:01:20
out of him he wears part of one but he is the son he is the son of god he jesus has flames of fire he has a lightning
1:01:27
power of god in his hands and he and he releases the anointing so he had his
1:01:32
things that made him a little bit different than the father but the father had us in him it said he
1:01:39
wasn't called him the mini breasted one because he nourished us and and fed us with his presence while we lived in him
1:01:46
now when okay so i i've got our time is always right i got two more quick questions too first of clarification
1:01:52
when the cross happened and he said it is finished was jesus suffering
1:01:58
done or did any suffering take place when he when he went to paradise or hell did he suffer
1:02:04
was there anything he had to suffer he did not physically suffer
1:02:10
or spiritually suffer you know it was i think more of an emotional one because for those three days he was
1:02:16
separated from the presence of the okay that's guess what i was trying to get at i guess yeah it was that kind of
1:02:23
suffering they never they never got to torture him they were planning that for the third day people
1:02:29
they were planning on the third day since the father didn't show up the first day didn't show up the second day
1:02:34
satan planned the show and i can prove it because principalities don't stay in
1:02:40
hell he called all the principalities in from around the earth so they could watch satan wanted them to watch him
1:02:48
torture the son of god so no he never got to do that the only torment for him was being separated from the voice and
1:02:54
the presence of the father but when that was over when that part was over and satan and
1:03:00
satan was about to get uh uh cut down by jesus christ he put the
1:03:05
biggest show on earth that ever had happened actually in the earth one shell was in heaven when the father kicked him
1:03:11
out the other second show was in inside the earth and the third one will be on
1:03:16
the earth by the manifested sons and daughters of god very very cool okay so one of our viewers just got a
1:03:22
question into into us and he he wrote or she i don't see if i have a name as a viewer had a question cat will
1:03:30
i go to hell if i commit suicide so apparently this person might even be
1:03:35
considering it i don't know so what's your how would you well i hope that they're not because
1:03:40
they're really wasting their life and throwing their life away you will continue to live your spirit man lives
1:03:47
eternally where it lives is up to you and i can't even answer that question
1:03:54
because that depends on if it is actual suicide or if you're trying to escape the
1:04:00
torment and the father on purpose told me this revelation some time ago
1:04:06
he said not what everybody's doing you know there came a time that people thought you know if your life was taken
1:04:13
that you you did that on purpose and and you didn't want to you know so it was called suicide
1:04:19
but the father taught me that not everyone who commits something similar to that
1:04:25
they're not wanting to die on purpose to never exist they're escaping the suffering and god is the only one who
1:04:31
can decide that did you do this on purpose and then the father said
1:04:37
go look up the word suicide in the dictionary i would encourage people to do that it says in the dictionary that
1:04:42
suicide is willingly knowingly understanding that you are ending your
1:04:49
own a life in other words you have all your faculties there's no emotions uh to
1:04:55
consider there's no mental state of being they're saying you have all your mental fat
1:05:00
faculties with no interference in your soul and you're still deciding to take your life
1:05:06
most people who end their life are mentally messed up
1:05:12
physically messed up or emotionally messed up so much so that their soul can't bear the suffering and they are
1:05:19
ending their suffering now this is from the most high god if you don't like those words that's too bad you go you go
1:05:25
talk to him he showed me this on purposes he said many of my my sons and daughters who belong to me ended their
1:05:32
suffering i'm not going to overlook the fact that they received my son and they could no longer bear of the suffering
1:05:39
maybe they had an accident maybe they were giving medicine to take that alter their
1:05:45
thinking this has happened before it will alter the way you think or you go into great deep depression
1:05:52
until you're in despair after despair hits you you're not going to be able to last here much longer
1:05:58
and god is the only one that knows the thoughts and intents of your heart or your soul and he will make that decision
1:06:05
but i was shown people in heaven that had ended their suffering because of the horror that they were living in the
1:06:12
torment the horrible abuse whether it was mental emotional or physical they couldn't handle it anymore so they ended
1:06:18
up suffering they went to heaven but if you in your natural mind with no
1:06:24
outside things affecting you decide to do that that that would be called suicide yes it wouldn't be between you
1:06:30
and god if um let me just ask i've never asked this question like this if someone is ready to end their life and they'll
1:06:36
say and they say to themselves i'll show him or i'll show her what they
1:06:42
did to me and that's gonna get you and then when you now you'll be sorry for how you
1:06:48
treated me when i kill myself how about that i would say that depends on what they
1:06:53
had been doing to them okay i mean if it was a horrible thing it was being done to them and they felt that way i
1:06:59
wouldn't say they had complete control of the faculty and the father even said this to me said
1:07:05
a good example to tell you if someone entering their suffering because the torment is so great and someone who
1:07:11
actually committed suicide would be a terrorist okay and he used that word a terrorist bomber
1:07:18
someone knowing and even right now i'm ready you know i'm going to blow them away and uh i i just will they won't
1:07:24
exist anymore so i'm just going to go end my life by killing them that's suicide yeah that would be suicide uh
1:07:31
like we know in 9 11. yeah and that doesn't count the suicide people on the plane the
1:07:39
terrorists on the plane that was suicide they had going out partying many of them the night before they knew what they
1:07:45
were going to do they had had meetings talking about it they knew they were knowingly willingly taking their own
1:07:52
life and they wouldn't exist anymore that is suicide
1:07:58
yeah and a lot of those people if it was a muslim terrorist a lot of them were taught
1:08:04
that they were going to heaven by because of this act of killing people that was what they were taught in the
1:08:11
reality they may be going to the the opposite way you know thinking about that
1:08:17
the bottom line is this that was a promise that was different that's not torment that's not messing with their
1:08:23
mental state or emotional state or physical state with their own mind in place they made a decision to take
1:08:31
their own life and god said many times it is not just a terrorist but people
1:08:36
who do that will also sometimes do it to harm or hurt on purpose i mean we have
1:08:41
other people who who did things like that that weren't necessarily muslims from every walk of life almost yeah even
1:08:48
people are paid they're saying well you know when you die you'll still whatever they say to them they choose to believe
1:08:55
that they'll be better off or they're choosing to believe that i will hurt everybody in the city i'll cause great
1:09:01
torment for them that's suicide okay the only way you can end your suffering is if you
1:09:07
yourself are in severe abuse or terrible torment mentally physically or
1:09:12
emotionally and god doesn't call that suicide that is from him that is his decision
1:09:18
and so that's the only way i can explain it is got it okay i'm going to end on a uh
1:09:25
happier note that was a heart that was a hard one um this is a question that escaped my mind
1:09:31
and then i remembered it a little later and that was i had asked you once because we were talking about you
1:09:36
can be what you want you can be taller if you want you and i had said well i want to be an athlete an athlete when
1:09:42
i'm in heaven because i'm not that one now you said yeah you can be athletic if you want to be athletic so if someone
1:09:47
says i want to be an artist i can't draw to save my life here but i want to be an artist in heaven i want to play the
1:09:53
piano in heaven do they do they get that do they get to do that i'm sure they do but again as i said if
1:10:00
it's not a gift that you were born with usually people who have that gift teach you
1:10:06
so you probably would have to have some instruction i've seen people the reason why i know this i've seen artists
1:10:11
teaching people who didn't do art before there's a place called the galleria in heaven where all the artists hang out or
1:10:18
they probably live near that place there's art going on everywhere and and they do teach people i've seen people
1:10:24
who danced have a studio uh they have a performance center so they can have full
1:10:29
displays artists have a gallery of their own in heaven and they can display their art that they give away
1:10:36
uh so i would say yes you and they have other people learning to do things that maybe they couldn't you learn it faster
1:10:42
in heaven yeah your gift is so important whether it's any of those things we just
1:10:47
talked about your gift will never be taken from you so if you were supposed to be if you were supposed to be an
1:10:53
artist and all you did was get to do a few things when you stepped through the gates of heaven that would be fully activated you would be a
1:10:59
legitimate artist a great artist no matter what um type of uh materials you
1:11:04
used in that art that would happen you always put the singing only sing for friends because you never had a way to
1:11:10
do that you would be singing in uh beautiful opera halls or performance centers in heaven your gift
1:11:17
will not be taken from you so nobody actually misses their destiny not even children yeah so i and let me let me
1:11:23
clarify this one question because i think now that i know you're talking about the gift versus what anything else a person goes
1:11:30
to heaven they love all their gifts that they have but they say i never had the gift
1:11:36
of piano playing or of artistry i've always wanted to have that gift because they tried to instruct me in school i
1:11:43
just didn't get it i couldn't do the art part i want to be gifted would god give them an additional gift
1:11:49
that they wanted in heaven maybe that's my question i don't think it's the way that you're saying it they still would
1:11:55
have to be trained or no of course that's yes they would have to be trained but yes if you don't have the gift those
1:12:02
who have that gift already there's a reason why he gave it to them is to use and display in heaven and
1:12:08
bless people you also there to train people how to do great art only you
1:12:13
don't need years to learn that you would pick it up really quick yeah because you're learning from an anointed
1:12:19
person that has the anointing for that it's not like you'd have to take weeks months or years of classes but you will
1:12:26
get instruction so what you do is you go look for somebody who has an artist studio or a gallery and go say yeah i
1:12:32
want i want classes i want classes and and and then you would learn from them but it would still be it would still be
1:12:38
beautiful it would be fantastic okay awesome all right well god bless you thank you so much for that uh tell people how they
1:12:45

1:15:13
for him i know he's in heaven so even though bruce didn't know exactly that he wouldn't lay in the grave for a while
1:15:19
we knew where he was going you know he knew he was saved but he just died so she and we both sat there and talked
1:15:25
she says ever since all the teaching by cat i've never looked at this the same we know where he's going she goes i feel
1:15:31
rejoice she you know maybe she shed a tear when i wasn't looking i'm sure she must have but you know she knew her
1:15:37
she's just celebratory all week we just went on with with live would there be a memorial later on a couple months from now
1:15:43
actually in the summer so that was you kat it's because you taught us the beauties of

1:16:34
that his body wasn't laying in the ground in the grave and he got to experience all that beauty and that
1:16:40
splendor right now and i know what he's already seen jesus has already probably had his celebration party or it's still

1:39
schultz along with my wife doreen we've uh founded the elijah list 25 years ago and
1:45
elijah streams is now the video portion of what you're watching and it's exciting times to be alive we got a
1:50
great show with cat coming up here so excited to show you that i've got a couple of announcements that are fun to make
1:56
um let's talk about let me do this uh jeff if you're ready uh let's run that native
2:02
the uh the clip that we have from uganda about the wells this is this will be uh laurie
2:08
sally her husband is not on camera but he's probably doing the video but laurie and her husband are the ones that
2:14
get the wells dug for us there in uganda they are actually most of the time they're stateside with
2:20
us i think it's they live in mississippi but this is their village that they built and oversee so they go over there
2:27
and they have people over there they get the wells done so this is another clip from lori when she's with some of the
2:32
people by one of the well so let's go ahead and run that
2:37
yeah my name's uh pasta giorgio chisolo the senior pastor of ever increasing
2:44
melaka church and uh also i'm fasting this community around you see here
2:52
first of all i want to thank god for this opportunity has brought
2:58
in our area concerns water you know in our area here getting water
3:03
is not that easy people are need to get money in order for them to
3:08
get water and other times people lacks money they even like something to eat
3:15
but getting a blessing of the world of the community will be a much much
3:21
blessings to our community first of all i want to thank the founders those who are putting in money
3:28
what you are doing is a great work you don't know what you are doing to our community but for we who are staying
3:35
here we have seen a great hand of god to provide the clean water
3:41
uh these people you see behind me they slope down down there very far from here
3:49
to get water uh to get clean water they are using open spring down there and then if they
3:56
get this water here it will ease in their body so
4:01
may the god bless you thank you for coming in i pray that god will bless you
4:07
and multiply you for that of giving god bless you
4:14
and now i was thinking that there was a clip there with lori but i i mean i must have had the wrong clip i was thinking
4:19
there was one here but we'll find that one and play that another time that we get quite a few clips coming in and i'm
4:24
starting to lose track of those but uh that's it's just amazing what you're doing uh all the wells we've dug i mean
4:31
april one is here uh i think day after tomorrow and then we start another home
4:36
three more wells will dig in that village or actually i say those villages because every well so far has been dug
4:42
in a different village so all the villages are you know they have a long walk and it's hot over there it's really
4:49
hot so it's an amazing thing but now i want to tell you about something that's just happened now i was i was thinking
4:55
you would see lori there but mike and laurie who have done this they we have just
5:00
uh made an agreement a partnership where mike and laurie are going to work with
5:05
us to get wells doug and some first nations places
5:10
uh we we we're right now in final talks with uh uh uh one of the tribes one of
5:16
the nations in the southwest part of the united states i'm not quite ready to announce it yet just because we want to make sure we we're going for it but
5:23
we're going to start putting wells for the first nations people uh one of the letters i got from them yesterday said
5:29
that some people have to drive 10 to 15 miles just to get the water to to drive 10 or 15 miles
5:36
back and you know what gas is doing these days how much expensive just to get water to live off of i had no idea
5:43
and we asked them you know where was the most need and she they said throw a rock anywhere in this
5:50
on this reservation i mean these are miles and miles uh wide and across i'm just beginning to
5:56
learn about it but wherever you throw a rock basically is what they're saying there's a need for will
6:01
so i hope that's going to get you excited because we'll start bringing you uh videos from native american
6:09
reservations i'm assuming they're all on reservations if there's anything different we'll tell you but very very
6:14
excited about it um when lori when i told lori and mike about this just yesterday because we you
6:20
know i said this is what i want to do and i wonder if you guys can help us and they had just come back from uganda
6:26
where you just saw the video there and she had been asked to go visit one of her former students that had been in
6:32
that village so so lori went there and the girl who's like 12 or 13 years old
6:38
now said i had a dream a word for you and this is the word i saw you helping indians and immediately she didn't know
6:45
at the time what that referred to she comes back and and this text arrives for me saying i want you to come and help
6:51
the first nations people and so they knew it was a match so we're going to be showing you
6:56
lots of wells that we get dug over there and you know the native americans are across our land and most most cities
7:03
have native american names and uh or many cities have that and streets that are named uh off of the first
7:10
nations people so we're gonna bless them back they blessed us and we're gonna bless them back so um all right now

8:16
let's bring cat current here hello everybody hey cat
8:23
good to see you as always i love your your i guess it's red if the
8:28
camera's got the right it's kind of a red or burgundy i love it that's nice it's got all kinds of colors in it and
8:35
thank you rose for sending it it's got hot pink but the white doesn't do well with cameras so
8:41
i try to get a few other colors up but it's i could wrap up in it like a blanket thank you
8:47
give me rose but people sometimes to get a little bit smaller scarves but this is great i love
8:54
it it's beautiful yeah i get ties once in a while people will send me a tie and i've got a collection
9:00
back there you should see the racks of ties i have you have any funny ones
9:05
yeah i should have worn them because you know i i feel safe wearing a funny one with you and then hank is a cartoonist
9:11
so i'll wear one of my goofy oh you definitely gotta wear a funny one with hank for sure make him laugh yeah so and
9:18
then i i i learned something on there because i wore something that had legos
9:23
of someone said well that's connected with an um impure agenda out there legos and then i wore a different thing
9:29
apostles and they said that's it that's connected with it i'm not going to say the word another agenda and i thought you know
9:36
what that i'm done with the enemy stealing god's designs and god's inventions and god's colors
9:43
you know and you know i do want to make a comment because you name them legos were one of
9:48
the most brilliant inventions ever and they weren't made by that confused group of people
9:55
okay they always try to take over something or own a little piece of something so they say that represents
10:01
them no it doesn't it represents fun now we're not talking about an image that likes belongs to satan we're not talking
10:07
about satanism or witchcraft okay it's a lego legos are fun for kids all of mine
10:13
can't play with them and they build things like they could be like church things they could feel anything it's for the
10:19
creative side of a child which god loves so we're praying for those people yes they're involved with that to break
10:25
anything off of it if you're not sure just for this is just going to be the first thing out there if you buy
10:31
something and you're not sure or you hear a comment like that take it whatever it is and say i cleanse this
10:37
for the kingdom and uh but i would say that legos is a brilliant idea of created by somebody
10:44
who wanted to give kids a fun way to create yeah and so we're praying over all those confused people that's how god
10:51
calls them by the way and he does love them you know who we're talking about yes he does
10:57
they think there's something they're not but this is why it's important for them to know who they are they can't totally
11:03
fulfill their destiny if they don't know who they are as a man or as a real woman or a man god made one or the other he
11:11
made us male and female not something else and the enemy does it so he can
11:16
pull them off the track to he's so afraid of these people that get caught in that because they would become great
11:23
for god and then they would really bash hell and so you have to understand we always hear one side of something and
11:29
i'm not agreeing with what what they agree with in any way because i know they're confused they're being somebody
11:34
they're not really and i know a lot of them that have gotten born again and they know deep in their soul who they
11:40
were god wrote on your soul if you were male or female before he ever sent you
11:45
to this earth and i know all these scientists these medical people gonna come up with their own ideas of that but
11:51
i can tell you god knew who you would be he said i wrote every day of your life in a book that was before he sent you
11:57
okay so he knows if you're male or female and let me tell you uh if you get born again and change that idea that you
12:04
have of who you are when you get to having you be happier male or female
12:10
god make you that way because he needs both of us in the earth to produce children
12:16
yeah that's good that's good so wow well kat let me just let me then uh
12:21
i've got my first question ready for you but before i get into my first question uh anything that you want to comment on
12:28
anything else in the news or anything else and on your heart before we get into that i would just say please join
12:34
number 45 new social media there you go please join it become a part of that you
12:39
get all kinds of things sent to you from our number 45 president and i can call
12:46
him that because he actually is a president i mean he actually is and we know he really is right now so you can't
12:53
stop saying that i'm not saying anything that isn't true but please join his new social media is
12:59
changing lives everywhere people are getting excited and that you have contact with him again so other than
13:05
that and continuation of people jumping off the bandwagon for
13:10
the left and talking about what's really going on behind some of those closed doors is
13:18
becoming shocking and at this point i can't name names but it's becoming shocking who is turning their back on
13:25
the left and then going in and testifying before not the normal committees
13:32
not before the normal committees or the uh the the um i'm trying to think in my natural mind
13:39
right now that doesn't work very well or the court or the car yeah there you go
13:44
there you go yeah the court where are they testifying are they
13:49
somewhere else other than the court or they are in the court they're not in the normal court at all you all know there's
13:55
more than one court right talking about the court of heaven they already know the truth anyway yeah but i'm talking about yeah there are things
14:02
still going on uh collecting evidence people yeah that will be spread everywhere
14:09
eventually you will see it everywhere names places dates the real thing
14:14
um when the news have to admit what happened with the 2020 elections
14:21
and who really is our president so aside from the comedy being put on by
14:27
the white house every time they ask one of their important leaders uh who don't know what to say and never
14:33
do say the right thing i think finally the comedians are getting some content from the left
14:39
i think they kind of drop more a little bit bashing the right it's a lot more exciting and funny to get some of those
14:45
quotes from the left who've never said anything right and it's more convincing
14:50
just let them keep talking people because it convinces more democrats to switch sides than anything else going on uh we
14:58
have the right and the conservative or god you know we may not convince people to change
15:04
sides but their own leaders these people don't have a brain this
15:10
country is not going to go anywhere they're right about that one uh but it will be going somewhere really soon and
15:16
you'll be excited about it so just remember this every time you hear something broadcasted that's so insane
15:22
like a five-year-old could do it better right i know migraine can run the country better right now
15:29
but when they open their mouth and say these insane things like they can't even think of a simple thing a question to
15:35
answer so they say the crazy thing it makes morally sophisticated intelligent
15:41
democrats to switch sides so they don't they don't have to be you know put in the same box as those crazy people yeah
15:48
very very good well kat thank you for that i appreciate that yeah these are very interesting times coming up as uh
15:54
if even now if you watch the patriot channels and i do because i don't watch the mainstream news
15:59
what does one watch when they don't watch mainstream news i look at patriot channels that love love this country and
16:06
they have they have things to say and they have what we call citizen journalists instead of asking going on
16:12
mainstream media looking for actual people who call themselves journalists we actually have real journalists
16:18
citizen journalists who are there on these places on these sites with these cameras and they put these things on you
16:24
see things and hear things that you didn't know they're from citizen journalists people that were there you know that's right and so it's really
16:31
really exciting to do that but i mean i just turn it off i just turn it off and how much
16:36
there is no secular news channel i ever wrote i did get my information mainly
16:42
from heaven because they really do know what's going on and and they also know the end they know what's going to happen
16:49
yeah and so but beside that you hear things like through friends or maybe somebody will send you something as a
16:55
meme or something is hilarious that's the only reason why i know what some of the left is saying
17:00
it's not because i actually watch those channels yeah i hear yeah well okay let me my first question i want to ask you
17:06
kat today is not on my particular list because i've been wanting to ask you i know you're going to have it all the time for anyone that's new you've been
17:12
to heaven thousands of times many people have a number of people have probably hundreds and hundreds but you know i've
17:19
known you for years and i've tracked with you and and i know you go all the time almost on a daily basis or probably
17:24
on a daily basis so i want to ask you you know we haven't asked for a while is there anything you've been seeing that
17:29
god has shown you about heaven that you've never yet shared that you can think of that something new or anything
17:35
that he's revealed to you about something that's in heaven or anything else that he told you just i i didn't
17:40
prepare you for the question so it might be within so much i i don't even know how
17:46
to start on that but he's always taking me to new places he's always showing me new revelation
17:53
i'm always seeing people who have gone home to heaven and see what they're doing really
17:58
one of the reasons why there's always going to be new places in heaven is
18:04
because of who's coming home because the people coming from the earth everybody has a gift that god made them
18:11
a gift i'm not not talking about spiritual gifts it's okay fivefold it's okay i'm not throwing that out with
18:17
about the baby in the bathwater and people don't even know what that means if you're born 90 years ago i still hear my mom say that
18:24
if someone's heard a little clips gets you know sent out there with my words but
18:29
um when you were made by god you live before that when you lived in him you
18:35
were still you you were you you always lived in him you've already been to the beginning and the end and the end of the
18:40
beginning because you lived in him in the father and uh when he when he sent you he put a
18:47
gift in you a natural gift you know why it was natural because when
18:52
you get to heaven you don't use spiritual gifts there's no five-fold ministry in heaven people you're trying
18:58
to question the laws pray for the sick help people try to understand the word the word is there so what would you do
19:06
that's why people don't have a clue they think it's boring but you're very wrong because the gift he put in you whether
19:12
it was you know a bronco rider or an amusement park creator
19:18
disney made it by the way people you argue with me all you want to i know that his place is going through all kinds of things right now
19:24
but he didn't make it that way we're going back to the fun thing god created places for fun yeah fun places are in
19:30
heaven fun places are on the earth and god made those so that we could have a delightful life and to laugh
19:37
so god put that those gifts in us because you will use that gift you will
19:43
not actually miss your final uh call on your life because your final call and your final vision god has
19:51
for your life is to be that gift in heaven that's why there's so many places all over heaven to enjoy things like
19:57
these because people get to use their gift in heaven it's usually your mansion is built around that gift
20:04
so every every time he takes me there's somebody new who's arrived there's new places to go to to see to enjoy
20:10
and that's one of the things that always amazes me that god knows who to send at
20:15
what time he times your birth on the earth and there's a reason for that he wants
20:21
you to release something here in the earth create something on the earth that he needs on the earth or just the words he gives you to say
20:28
it's very important but i i have been to some new places in heaven one i think i mentioned it once
20:34
was the hall of the heroes and but he keeps taking me there and who you think
20:40
is a hero on in this world it probably would be someone like a fireman a policeman or somebody in the military
20:47
but there are what i would call everyday people in heaven's hall of heroes that you
20:54
don't know or never knew but you find that about them when you get to heaven people who maybe they passed out
21:00
sandwiches every every week in this one area of town you never knew that they fed people
21:06
maybe maybe it was ordering you know 500 crystals or i don't even know if they're still around or chick-fil-a's you know
21:13
and then you take them to this whole area and just pass them like anybody who's hungry you don't ask what they believe or who they are you're feeding
21:20
people that god highly honors in heaven they would be called a hero in heaven
21:28
that would be a hero in heaven and so a lot of the people we do recognize as heroes on the earth they are recognized
21:33
in the hall of heroes but then there's this wonderful place this wonderful part of the hall of heroes which is would be
21:40
for the everyday person who maybe never had a special position or reached a
21:46
certain level in their intelligence or maybe an education or was known or they became famous on the earth that doesn't
21:53
mean uh you will be known in heaven everybody watches you to see the kindness you give really you're praying
22:00
for a whole group of sunday school children maybe your school teacher and you're imparting into these little kids
22:06
truths about god and stuff like that that would be a hero in heaven that person
22:11
in heaven and so i think the holy heroes is you cannot escape being blessed and
22:16
honored by god in heaven and i know down here we give all the glory to christ but you can't there's no way you can escape
22:22
being recognized and honored wow by even the slightest simplest thing that you do on his behalf or for him
22:30
he's going to make sure you get recognized so be prepared when you go there to be quite surprised and delighted when you're taken to the hall
22:37
of heroes and see who god counts as a hero i want to ask you about that too because you know
22:43
we're taught yeah we're taught not to take the glory and we don't so in heaven there's rewards everywhere for everyone
22:50
to see on purpose by god so if you walk up to someone you see their reward you see their massive mansion and you
22:56
realize the good things that they did and you see the rewards so the couple questions do you do you
23:02
just say thank you for what you did do you do you praise them for the good works then do
23:08
they say thank you or do they say oh no all glory goes to god how does that work um he
23:14
won't let them say in heaven oh no all the glory goes to god because he's already met with him and said this is my
23:20
way to honor you don't say you're don't never say you're not important in heaven
23:25
it's okay to receive a blessing from god and i would i would say wow you've got
23:31
the most amazing blessing from god i'm so thrilled that he honored what you did on the earth
23:36
and even though i didn't know you on the earth you know i can see that you you really touched the heart of god
23:42
isn't he awesome okay recognition does go back to god but he
23:47
wants people to be honored even down here he says show i'll give honor to whom honor is due he says it in the word
23:52
while we're here on the earth so we're not going to miss being honored in heaven and so the people that are being
23:58
complimented so they're saying i mean i'm this is a silly question but they're just saying thank you thank you
24:03
and they're they're they're happy to be thanked for that yeah in other words
24:09
yeah i mean of course it's an obvious question but i mean we are so trained to give the glory to god and stay humble
24:15
that it's like it's it's really that's almost if it was on earth it'd be hard to train
24:21
people with that because they would be so sure that they were not supposed to receive praise for that but yeah okay oh so i
24:28
have another question you talked about five minutes ago and um in heaven and there's all these fun
24:33
things in the in the amusement park theme parks whatever we call it okay so this question came up before it's like
24:40
if somebody let's say after the cross and there were no cars there were no vehicles there are no phones there's no
24:47
technology as we know it today and someone right after the cross dies and uh is transported to heaven i
24:54
mean right after christ is ascended and all that they go right there and they see all the amusement parks and all the cars and all
25:02
the trans all of that right away they're not walking around the robes because we haven't got there yet
25:09
oh they uh they get to go to the welcome center in heaven and um which i laughed
25:15
the first time um jesus told me about the welcome center but i could totally see why it's needed especially people if they were
25:22
stuck in a certain denomination where they thought nobody should have music oh wow they didn't like dance even as a
25:30
form of worship because people are dancing all over the streets in heaven and there's music everywhere you know i
25:36
i think they probably need to go to the welcome center they'd like to know this is really heaven
25:42
this isn't the other side has always had music they've always had uh people dancing delightfully or or
25:50
fiercely in worship they do a lot of the jump type dances i don't even know what they call like where you just stand and
25:55
jump up and down in celebration it gets so exciting to be a part of that in heaven so yeah i think
26:02
that would be one way to explain people who thought there'd never be any fun in heaven
26:07
when you go to heaven you begin to think more like a child than you ever did in your life
26:14
you were uh let's just say you were a professor at one of the biggest universities you knew jesus christ you
26:19
knew he died for your sins and you received him but you thought heaven would be more of an intellectual place
26:25
we'd get really high intellect you know to maybe be more like god well you do
26:31
become more like him but he likes to have fun he we were little children on the inside
26:37
of him and it says you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom of heaven that's your faith that your
26:43
trespass also your joy and your desire to have fun and so the devil doesn't want anyone to
26:50
have fun right now he thinks that he's got everybody by crushing them and keeping them oppressed
26:55
fun really is does something in your soul that begins to connect you with god
27:00
himself with the father himself and you think more like a child so it's not like
27:06
maybe for the first little bit of time that you're there you're kind of quite surprised and and you're filled with
27:12
wonder uh but then you realize this is really what it's like i enjoy this you're
27:19
getting it with joy and then you begin to release joy because you've got so much of it in you
27:24
uh almost everything you experience in heaven it'll it'll wash over on other people near you in heaven they'll begin
27:30
to laugh or they'll begin to cheer is there a sense where even for a moment in time
27:36
uh someone who spent their whole life with restrictions is there a moment in time in heaven
27:41
where they where you suddenly go what was i thinking when you see it or is it not is it so fleeting what have you seen
27:48
any of that i'm quite sure there are people who absolutely say that
27:53
why did i not understand that he could be fun why did i not think yeah it could
27:59
be the most heaven she'd be the most exciting amazing place in existence and right now
28:06
it is yeah but we're gonna we will end up with more of that on the earth after this whole thing you know this platform
28:12
is cleaned off and god starts doing what he's got planned for right now uh but i know quite a bit that people
28:19
will stand there and just stay with their mouth open on the streets of gold like they're really gold i think they really
28:25
are they're really gold then they get down on they get down they want to touch it's about gold streets like this this is
28:32
really real the the bible was right it's really real i think it begins to tie them more and
28:38
more they see the word in a way they never thought as being real you know uh people a lot of a lot of
28:45
people like to say the word is symbolic of things but it really literally means what it says
28:51
especially when it talks about heaven and i know some some people i think are more amazed over the size of mansions
28:58
thinking you know you're happy with a little cabin somewhere in paradise yeah hey
29:04
if your cabin is going to be inside your mansion people because this is god's way to bless you
29:12
and to provide a place for you he provides this place for you in heaven it's not going to be small or cheap by
29:19
any means and yes he wants to delight your heart it even says in the bible he'll give you
29:25
the desires of your heart but even heaven is way beyond anything you could have thought of or imagined sure
29:31
we're not god never will be him but we are his sons and daughters and like any good father they're going
29:38
to provide something amazing for their own children as a father on the earth so if you imagine the one
29:45
who's made everything and time came from him he's not somewhere in time it comes
29:51
from him that's just a that's a bizarre concept okay mr peter i think that was the one thing
29:57
that i knew the minute i saw him that time came from him and he will use time
30:03
for a while then he won't need it anymore he won't need time yeah just like this is i can't imagine without the
30:09
passage of time but i want to ask you a question about on the other side of it so i'm on one question was what do you
30:15
think of when you go there and you go what was i thinking with all my restrictions so i want to know the other side what does god think like okay 25
30:23
years ago i went to these were lovely people so i'm not criticizing i i went to a wedding i was invited to the
30:29
wedding and they didn't tell me anything so i showed up in my a sport coat and a tie shirt and tie and dressed up my wife
30:36
and kids all we were all there well they didn't have any music there was no jewelry every all the
30:42
women's the buns on top the one there was a simple whitish
30:48
colored dress just very simple and the men all had white
30:53
shirts but no tie normal it almost looked like work pants because there
30:58
all this effort was put into not showing off not being on display so i for by default i thought
31:07
they're completely on display that's all i can think about here but that was their restrictions that's what they
31:13
believed in their heart that god wanted so god's looking at these people god loves those people what's he thinking
31:19
generation after generation when people what this have you seen that side of god where he would talk about it he's
31:25
thinking how much fun will i have when they get here
31:30
and they begin to realize that they live below what he wanted them to live okay
31:37
way below what he would would want us to live the word says number one that
31:42
christ became poor that we might be rich that's rich with wealth but that's also
31:47
rich in joy rich in creativity rich and you know he doesn't want to take
31:52
everything away from you uh being poor and looking poor is not
31:58
holy i think that might be the point they think if i wear too much or i look different people will think i'm not holy
32:04
holy on the inside of you holy is how you choose to live no sin
32:10
no darkness okay no deception in you no doom and gloom in
32:15
you holy is being like god it says be holy as he
32:20
is holy so it's not impossible to be there you just don't have any darkness in you you
32:25
receive christ the light of life is in you joy and hope is coming from you uh you
32:32
you don't partake of anything of the enemy it says to resist the devil and he'll flee from you so you can't tell me
32:37
that's not possible it says in the word it is and pretty soon the devil will stop looking for you because he doesn't
32:43
want to get beat up with your words or your worship to christ and so we tend to
32:49
think uh there's just going to be a point where there's too much i shouldn't have a lot there's nowhere in there look at
32:54
the splendor haven't he displayed with solomon ryan because he obeyed god
33:00
solomon obeyed he did what god asked him to do so did david uh you cannot
33:06
you can't escape being blessed if you let him bless you if there's nothing wrong in having money you can't have it
33:13
have control you i know my dad used to say you know god sends it he spends it that's why i say
33:18
that a lot which is true whatever god sends me or people send me i allow god to do it with any way he wants to but he
33:25
doesn't want me to live in a hovel he does not want me to live a poor or
33:30
lacking in any way whatsoever heaven is that's not heaven on earth as it is in
33:36
heaven means you have more than enough to bless other people to help build cities to help send the truth around the
33:42
world that's that's who god is that's what he wants and i'm going to take you back to the
33:47
word glory you mentioned in the beginning yeah we tend to say i'll give you all i give all the glory back to you
33:54
but he actually wants you to carry it really okay christ in you
34:00
the hope of glory that's not that's not christ saying i hope you i hope you have a lot of glory for me that's not what
34:07
that is christ in you he's hoping that you recognize that when you create that for
34:12
him you get to carry it and then release it it's something you will release okay glory is very powerful it's the
34:19
light of god the power of god is what the glory is people think it's all about just worship
34:25
well even worshiping god creates glory but when you create it by the way you live your life it begins to build on the
34:32
inside of you where's christ in you christ is a hope of glory i want to bring
34:38
another a point about the glory for all have sinned how have they sinned fell short of the
34:46
glory come short of the glory and yet christ in you is the hope of
34:52
glory if you put those together you meditate on that you might be able to get a little bit of
34:57
understanding he wants you to display the glory
35:04
that builds in you to that he created christ in you is the hope that you will create glory and then use the glory for
35:11
him is something you use for him it's okay i give you i used to do that all the time
35:17
at the end of my meetings i gave you all the glory he said you've already given it to me by allowing me to use you oh
35:23
wow you surrender to me and allow me to use you to to tell truth and revelation about me
35:30
the father the holy spirit about heaven about time he said that that is giving
35:36
it to me interesting now he he said uh-huh well he said in the word okay i
35:42
want to ask you this the before and after before old testament at least he says i will share my glory with no one
35:48
no man no one and then the new is it that in the new testament that's when he starts sharing his glory
35:55
okay it's all about jesus christ that's why christ in you what what is different
36:01
than the old testament christ is in you that's the difference the price he paid
36:08
he there's so many reasons why he died for us and people say well yeah our sins there's so much more than just sins
36:15
being forgiven people are you kidding the risen lord who made everything that ever existed he made it with his father
36:23
why did he do that why did he die why did he go through so much and then it
36:28
was finished for salvation at the cross but if he was done
36:34
at that moment he'd have gone home to heaven there was more he had to do
36:39
for the power and for the glory he he had to go into abraham's muslim he
36:46
had to preach the gospel to all those who god counted as righteous because they believed in him yeah he wanted them
36:53
to know who their savior was who the messiah was all those who were waiting all that time and faithful to that
36:59
belief he wanted them to know here he is here he is and yet even in some of those
37:06
had created glory but they didn't have the ability back in the old testament to carry it
37:13
because he didn't live in them so everything changed
37:18
everything changed when christ was born in the earth when he took the cross and
37:23
when he when he took all your sins evil wickedness hate everything that was evil
37:29
or wicked or murder or everything that was defiling that was put on the cross with
37:35
him that's why he died on the cross he didn't die on the cross just so his body can hang there it's what he carried what
37:40
he took in the garden in his own being that had to be crucified or he could not
37:46
forgive sins yeah but it's also why he's the only one who can forgive sins why so you can create
37:53
glory carry the glory and release the power in the light of god throughout the earth
37:59
the understanding the knowing and the understanding of the glory that's the use of it that's the release
38:06
of it will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea it is in the word people don't have revelation on that
38:11
yeah yeah um you know it talks about uh oh boy i'm gonna lose this train of
38:16
thought let me just see if i can grab it oh yeah okay so we're we are joint heirs with christ and
38:23
then there's scriptures that say everything and jesus said everything is mine i give to you and everything that the father has given to me and
38:29
everything i have i give to you we own we we're supposed to be if we're joint heirs that means whatever he
38:36
inherited we inherit what about that have we not grasped that we are supposed to get on this side of heaven are we are
38:44
we not grabbing hold of what we are i think the biggest thing that
38:50
most of the body i'm only talking about believers right now not those who don't know him they
38:56
need to know him and i think what we will have a mass of people running into the kingdom but those who already belong
39:04
to jesus christ i think they are not grasping the power part okay the
39:11
dominion part okay but christ talked about it he talked about the gospel of
39:16
the kingdom well it wasn't just the gospel the gospel message the gospel is about being
39:23
born again but the kingdom that he never stopped talking about was the ruling part the dominion and authority over
39:29
darkness wow even to the point of creating things not people or plants or stuff like that but
39:36
the creative ability we have people aren't grasping they're not grasping that you are kings a king a spiritual
39:42
king has more authority in the earth than one little tiny demon does anywhere and yet we aren't using it yeah
39:50
yeah i'm i'm seeing a picture while you're talking i'm getting this picture going through my head of all god's
39:55
people and we're dressed up as policemen we've got this authority and firemen and military people
40:01
we've got this kind of spiritual authority and we're going lord i don't know what to do i don't you know i know
40:06
i'm supposed to understand that i have authority in you but i've got nothing and he's seeing people in uniform i
40:12
don't know that's the picture that's in my head so i don't know you're right they don't really know who
40:18
they are which is the whole point of spirit force that he's having begin to mentor people the first thing i
40:25
talk about in spirit force is who are you as as someone who has received jesus
40:31
christ who are you yeah and then i start talking about who they really are
40:38
them to be who they are what is our purpose on the earth it's not just to be happy win a few
40:44
souls and then die and go home to heaven is so much greater than that so much
40:50
and i think the other thing they're not grasping for sure not grasping is what is the spirit realm what how why
40:56
do we have to talk about the spirit realm why do we need to know about the unseen realm it's where your power is
41:02
displayed and where it's released the whole christ in you the hope of glory
41:08
that glory you can't see it or touch it with your hands but it's there and christ is hoping you will understand and
41:15
learn that you need to do something with that i mean baptism and fire is is
41:21
is not happened yet people had measures of it when that happens no one will have to say did i get baptized in fire you
41:28
will know and you will feel you'll know this what happened that brings boldness to you but the glory
41:34
is a whole different thing the glory and the fire are two different things and i think not understanding what he gave us
41:42
when he died for us when he said we're joint heirs what he operated in we can operate in yeah we have a story
41:49
over here an authority over but christ himself was not poor yeah and i i mean i saw baptism
41:56
because we were all trained up in this i was a child of the 50s 60s but when i got baptized it was like fire insurance
42:02
i i now was going to go to heaven and then i was going to try and live a good life to make sure i didn't
42:08
you know burn my ticket but i was going to but i down you know i got baptized he was you know
42:13
but that's a t-shirt that's a t-shirt uh don't burn your ticket
42:20
that's a good one there's a marketing tip right there that one just popped in my head never used that before but i
42:26
mean but i mean you know that's the way we are we just it was fire insurance we didn't want to
42:32
right you know and if a certain preacher scared you scared the hell out of you then you would say okay i don't want to
42:38
burn so i'll return and then you accept it you baptized that's why people got saved you get
42:45
every week yeah the generations passed they got saved every week to make it for the ones well
42:50
every now and then they'll think about it no we got saved every week we're at the altar every single week repeating
42:56
what we've already done yeah we get that growing and going forward and conquering things yeah spirit oh pushing back
43:03
darkness crushing the plans of the enemy i'm talking about the spiritual enemy uh a pastor is supposed to train you to do
43:11
the work of the ministry which is operating in power and authority and dominion and everybody thinks we're all supposed
43:17
to be evangelists and every day the way you live your life you should live as a witness to want people that would want
43:23
them to know god but but we didn't go any further i'm you know i'm going on you know natural
43:29
natural years i'm in my 60s right now i don't even think that i i think timeless
43:35
and people should think well i'm here this time part of my life and when it gets to this age i can't do this anymore
43:40
no you should keep going conquering over darkness the whole time
43:46
you're on the earth until he takes you home so his purpose was to get us born again
43:52
and then begin to operate in the kingdom which is where the power
43:57
the glory and the dominion will be dispersed and used in the earth and i think that's probably the
44:03
the one number one thing is they don't know what they have yeah we don't know what he gave them and so
44:10
what they knew from 100 years ago 200 300 400 500 years ago they're kind of stuck in this rut
44:16
of yes and then you know i love what mario marilla does that's his call on his life that's what god called him to
44:23
to bring revival and to do that that's the thing i'm a prophet i have to say what god says and in these
44:30
days which is not the end it's only the beginning of the power of god being
44:36
displayed through us okay the first wave in heaven the second wave of power being shown was in hell
44:44
wiping up how the third wave is us on the earth displaying in power and authority operating as kings lords and
44:50
priests spiritual levels of dominion and authority is what we don't know how to
44:56
do good so good cat yeah i mean i could talk you and i could sit here and talk a
45:02
long time about how we were raised i remember when i did get baptized i was serious i mean i i really wanted to know
45:08
god i always had a desire to know god but my thinking about the god that i didn't know until late in my 20s i
45:16
didn't really get to know him is that i i remember i was 10 years old and then we had a potluck after church and mom
45:22
said one dessert well you know there was very busy and i got went got back a second dessert knowing i was disobeying
45:29
my mom and i felt like dirty slime because that was our understanding of god if you disobeyed him it's like
45:37
you know i'm so ashamed of you like you know like a parent might say he's not a very good parent and i grew up in that
45:43
but anyway there was so a million miles away from the authority uh i want to ask a
45:48
question about because i want to make sure people don't think i'm any way um dissing people that have restrictions
45:54
that they serve the lord the best they know how um and elmer had a it was taken
46:00
around the earth it's our first book called transported by the lion of judah yeah and he took her on the lion on the
46:06
line himself and he flew her all over the earth and they'd stop at various churches and there was this one
46:13
gathering i i pictured in outdoors it may have been indoors i don't know but it was very
46:19
dry what you would think it was an old-timey dry no power it didn't seem like there
46:25
was any power but they were trying to pray and they were praying the
46:30
best they knew how and what the lord showed her at each place was and what he showed her here
46:37
was these are some of my favorite people on the earth because they're no matter what
46:42
life is thrown at them i'm just paraphrasing from memory they're still seeking me so i mean that i mean if you
46:48
were there as a seer you would have seen the activities of heaven i suppose in that dry place
46:54
yeah the i mean the the angels were still there i'm sure the spirit of god
46:59
even if they didn't have holy spirit on the inside he would have been right there next to them leading guiding the
47:05
best he can and they did because their heart it's where their heart was it's always where your heart
47:11
is yeah yeah they were doing in that time in society
47:16
or in in the earth what was going on in the world they didn't abandon christ
47:21
they didn't abandon him they still honored him they still loved him and they still sought him and seeking him is
47:27
one of the most important things you can do i think sometimes people maybe get caught up in them it's okay to have fun
47:34
but you can't you can't forget the awe of god and the wonder of god and who he
47:40
is and i am undone every single time i'm with the father
47:46
and with the son or even completely undone really these who have made everything
47:53
uh sought me to speak with me and to give me a commission i'm totally undone you
47:59
know i'm always thinking i i have a 12th grade education you know i don't i don't have wisdom in the earth
48:06
and god said for you you don't need wisdom in the earth and he's and i said you know i don't have a lot and he said
48:12
but you're going to have unlimited one day you need to prepare your heart for that because you're generous you're kind
48:19
and he said and you love me you love me you love my son you love
48:26
holy spirit you love the word of god you honor your mom your mother and your father he said you are you're so kind
48:34
you're perfect for what we want you to do you love people and he said us that's the greatest thing you can offer and
48:40
you've offered it's in extravagance what i have given to you in the earth's eyes
48:45
it might not be much but to us it is tremendous that there is someone on the
48:51
earth who wants to be with us who wants to seek us who wants to know us
48:56
and it's wonderful to seek him but why are you seeking him just for him
49:02
to know him to be with him uh is is a delight to the father son and holy
49:08
spirit that people really want to know them and i think that means so much to god
49:13
that's what those people were doing in those simple meetings they wanted to know him yeah and what they knew what they had at that
49:20
time in in in any amount of revelation they were running after that yeah
49:26
that's why god would send waves of things to the earth you know when when the healing thing came it changed people
49:33
forever when the holy spirit came the reason that changed people forever and now we're we're going to have the glory
49:40
and then after that the fire and then then the power of god is about to hit
49:45
this earth through us we are his sons and his daughters he
49:51
wants us to display who we are in him because of him and with him that's what his purpose
49:58
is he doesn't he doesn't have to look at your education or your position or what
50:04
you have right now it's where is your heart is your heart to help to love uh are you are you
50:10
having conversations with him about that yeah and people would go well i need to pray that is prayers conversation yeah you
50:17
know the you you said that before cat you said that before and i don't want people to miss that because i've
50:24
gone over that i've been times when i'm praying and i'm thinking lord i don't know how to pray and then i then would
50:30
pop into my head cat said prayer is just conversation with god and oh okay i got
50:36
this hey lord how are you doing today you know have you seen you know and it and prayer
50:42
kicks in conversation kicks in right it's not we think of these people who are on
50:47
their face which is fine right it is what that's what they know to do and
50:54
their heart is to do the best at what they know that's that's what they have uh i would encourage
51:00
anyone and i know i i am still an intercessor i intercede but i have
51:06
conversation all day long and all night long and i talk about deep things with the father but i talk about just simple
51:12
things with him too as i am his daughter number one i'm his daughter number one you're his son and
51:18
daughter before you're anything else you know what we try to achieve in the earth what's important in the earth is
51:24
what are you doing with your life um and yes you want to be with them and talk to them but outside what are you
51:30
doing outside what are you displaying outside the love of god the life of god the hope of god uh the power of god or
51:37
you're sharing that kind of truth about him yes it's important to share the gospel always but but add some excitement into
51:43
that you know you need christ you need to know you don't want to miss your destiny what did he make me what do you love to
51:49
do are you a baker is that what you dream about and have passion about you know he put that in you that's that's
51:55
okay to run after that he gave me that then you touch people where they are right now and you get them excited about
52:01
who he made them to be that wasn't just by coincidence you decided you couldn't stop talking about
52:07
boats you want to run one you want to take people on one you want to design them and build them that's the creator that god put that in you
52:15
um we were talking something you said i don't know just click this in but um i'm seeing like people watching right now
52:22
and a lot of them there's not someone leading them to the lord and maybe they've received them
52:27
they don't know but their sense is like my father if he wasn't angry he'd
52:32
be disappointed which was almost worse and he'd say i am so disappointed in you so there's people going god is so
52:39
disappointed at the things i've done i just can't i can't attain what would you
52:44
say to those people with what you know about god's love i would say
52:49
if you had a little child let's say three or four and they make mistakes
52:54
probably all day long and do you do you punish them for that
53:00
you punish them because they're still in a learning place uh they they love you they want to hug
53:06
you on dudes but maybe they haven't learned really what they should do what they shouldn't do he's not going to
53:12
abandon you his hope is for you he desires great things it says in the bible that his hope is for you he's not
53:18
against you that's the main thing in the word and i know people probably told you well you just went too far now that was
53:24
the devil the devil always try to make you feel less than or unworthy
53:31
that is not god god is not wanting you to feel unworthy if you aren't worthy
53:36
his son would not have died for you okay that that was done while yet you were
53:42
sinners he died because of the love the father has for you
53:47
and and christ has that love because his father has that love for you go to him quickly and say i'm so sorry i
53:53
did that i'm so sorry i said that what what can i do that would blush you you know say things like that you would be
54:00
surprised what would come into your heart what kind of doors would open for you if you if you ask those kinds of things
54:07
of them you have not because you ask not and people always say well i i can't pay
54:12
my rent because i haven't asked for help you it's okay to ask for that help but you need to go beyond that what about
54:19
being creative what about the gift he put in you what about opportunities to use it ask him to open those doors
54:26
you're building a relationship just like any earthly father or mother who loved their child would build a relation for
54:32
you yeah you get correction but then he gives you love and he gives you instruction and direction god's not
54:39
leaving anyone and he said i will treat anyone who's born again like a child and
54:45
that this is how i will work with them i love them but i don't love them if i don't bring correction but when i bring
54:51
correction i always bring direction so love correction and direction is how god
54:56
works with us because you make a mistake he's not kicking you to the curb and saying you're not worth anything that's the
55:03
devil's thing yeah you're going to build a relationship uh
55:08
being a christian is all about relationships yeah you know you just said that church you belong to or don't
55:14
belong to it's your relationship with him christ made a way why did he die to take
55:21
us back to the father in relationship people that his greatest desire is to have that
55:28
relationship and for you to know him in that way that doesn't mean you can willfully sin all the time and think
55:35
you'll get away with it what that means is you're never gonna do anything for god spending all the time is what keeps
55:41
you from growing things from god yeah but knowing that he wants to know you and his greatest desire is to see you
55:48
become something that helps people that that creates things for people that brings love and kindness to people and
55:56
and he does love everybody yeah but everybody isn't going to go to heaven that's that's that's that is a myth okay
56:03
receiving jesus christ who is the only one who can wipe away your sins like you've never sinned and by the way let
56:10
me mention this please do not keep reminding of god of the sins
56:16
you were forgiven for he already forgot them right you're wasting your time yeah
56:21
maybe you had a simple past you know if he didn't put you on a platform to share that to get people to know god
56:28
does things with people who mess things up okay yeah that's all he has to work that's all he
56:33
has to work with right you know what you're doing really you're marketing hell yeah if you do nothing but talk about
56:40
your past sins you will live in the past and never go into your future
56:46
because that's all that's in you what's in you is coming out if all you can talk about is all the sins that you were
56:52
already forgiven for that's called wasteful words because to god the sins are gone like
56:57
they never happen how about talking about the glory or hope for people or god's not done with
57:04
people yet he's not done with you he has more for you no matter who's listening but but his heart is for you
57:11
he carried you before you were sent here he wants you to come back to him that's
57:17
why christ died to make a way back to the father you know we've said lately uh
57:22
you may have been on these one when we talked about whatever right now whatever the mainstream media
57:29
blasts uh as truth and johnny will pull and i will point this out you know that
57:34
the opposite of everything they're saying is the real truth yeah so i like when my dad was under the influence of
57:41
the devil he would say get out of my sight i don't want to look at your face so the absolute opposite is
57:48
true about god yeah god says you've sinned and you've messed up come here i
57:53
want to look you in the face and tell you it's going to be okay and help you restore you right it's the opposite
57:59
it is the opposite it's the absolute opposite and the devil's really good at lying he is a father of lies so most of
58:07
the time when you hear things that that aren't nice or aren't good or aren't happy that don't bring life or hope or a
58:13
chance for a future most of that stuff you hear is from the devil even if it's the fake news saying
58:20
it or people who are angry people get really angry they spew on everybody around them uh most people who
58:27
are have are filled with fear believe it or not fear causes you to lash out
58:32
it's unfounded fear and or anger makes you lash out of innocent people and the
58:38
devil will make sure the innocent get bashed because he doesn't want them to
58:44
grow up with any hope or worthiness and yet you look and see what christ offered
58:50
this world and everyone out there if you're sinning you're marketing hell helping hell when
58:57
the son of god came and died and didn't have to gave up everything to live on
59:03
this earth went into hell wasted hell on the third day took back the power and
59:08
authority that god gave adam who gave that away to the enemy don't
59:14
partner with hell or darkness you're hurting yourself and the future generations coming up from you why not
59:21
begin to act like god does he forgives he brings hope he inspires he empowers
59:28
that's who he is he is not the evil wicked god and he does not send people
59:34
to hell they choose to go there to excuse the beautiful awesome sacrifice
59:40
that christ did so you can go to heaven with no sin no quickness no evil because
59:46
if god let everybody come to heaven heaven would be like the earth and it's not
59:51
it's filled with glory splendor wonder fun excitement creativity
59:57
but on earth as it is in heaven is how god wants us to live like we
1:00:02
already have that we become that for him in this earth god's not bashing you he's
1:00:08
not hating you and he's not ignoring you you're yelling so loud for the enemy you
1:00:14
can't hear him speaking that's huge cat what you just said you're like you're
1:00:19
yelling so loud for the enemy just rehearsing their stuff rehearsing their fault rehearsing how
1:00:26
god's probably fed up with me you know i used to think that i must be a hard case for god as if that could
1:00:32
happen by anybody you know but i mean yeah cat you had said a few minutes ago
1:00:38
and this is surprised me you said when you go to heaven you're undone every time do you mean every time
1:00:44
i am and you are no i go like i'm a little i'm a little girl but in my heart
1:00:52
in my heart which is my soul every time it says heart in the bible is talking about your soul people
1:00:58
soul is the heart of your being he's not talking about your human heart guard your heart that's your soul for out of
1:01:06
all the way you live your life as it taketh in his soul so is he right so
1:01:11
your soul your mind your will and emotions my soul is undone because in my
1:01:16
spirit man i go in my spirit my soul is in me my soul is undone
1:01:21
by how how excited god is to to to see how i respond to him to see how much i love
1:01:29
him and i couldn't wait to obey maybe you should say god i want to get to the place where i can't wait to obey
1:01:35
what you say that's good you know what happens obey obedience becomes like
1:01:40
breathing like breathing is the most normal thing that you would choose there's this
1:01:45
there's no even consideration of darkness in you it's there's no darkness in you christ jesus said there's none of
1:01:51
him in me he was talking about satan that's why he had no power over him there was no darkness in christ
1:01:58
there was none of him in him he was filled with the father the love and the life of the father
1:02:04
and let me tell you a human can be that way really wow because i am
1:02:11
i am i am that way all the time ask anybody i'm happy i love people i don't
1:02:16
care what color your skin is guess what you you're you're still going to be you in heaven every tongue tribe and nation
1:02:23
whether people don't like you or not god loves you he made you the way he loves the color of your skin he gave you that
1:02:29
color of your skin that's so good yeah and you you and i mentioned this recently with you on the
1:02:35
program there i have seen that in you that um you don't you know
1:02:40
jesus talked about nathanael a man in whom is no guile you strike you come off
1:02:45
you are a person in whom there's no guile you don't have an agenda you don't have an attitude i'm not you know here
1:02:51
we're not trying to over worry about giving you glory i'm not trying i'm doing that
1:02:58
i'm i'm i'm a i was like middle of class graduating you know i was like middle of everything
1:03:04
i there was no place i ever excelled in my personal life as a person
1:03:10
but i always had a desire to know god and of course my father and my
1:03:16
grandmother who were lived holy uh were good examples to me but i knew people
1:03:21
who have wonderful children who who didn't have the best parents when they realized god really is their true father
1:03:30
and how much he loves us i understand more and more the sacrifice christ made
1:03:36
and why would i want to do anything the fear of the lord is not being afraid of him
1:03:42
yeah yeah being afraid you will be less
1:03:48
or love him less than you should the fear is you don't want to hurt the heart of the lord it's not like
1:03:55
you don't want to you know you're so afraid of him that he might hit you or smack you people use that scripture for
1:04:00
that that's not what that means but in saying the same thing i will tell you something new god's showing me the
1:04:07
father is the terror of god that is god himself the terror of god
1:04:14
usually comes against extremely wicked evil really really evil wicked people who
1:04:20
have sowed themselves to the enemy he has small toleration for them
1:04:25
who has wiped christ out of their life will never want him have no desire who
1:04:30
evil are wickedly hurting maiming killing people the the terror of god is about to
1:04:37
consume some of those people i remember prophet walking up to me one time i was just out in the glory on the floor he
1:04:42
goes a god will give you he will tell you what to say to men about the terror you would tell them
1:04:48
about the terror of god these wicked people and uh and i can tell you that's something that hasn't really been
1:04:54
quite released yet but there's a whole camp of wicked evil that is so deep and wicked they're about to experience ways
1:05:00
of the terror yeah coming up at the time before i get too far from this one thing you're making a point i want to make sure we we get it all in there as i'm
1:05:08
watching you even on camera right now you you talking about you're undone by god and when i can i
1:05:14
just make an observation you're undone by who he used you're undone
1:05:21
you you're undone that he that the education you didn't have
1:05:27
was no impediment that the talent you didn't have i mean that's what i'm getting from you have you always felt
1:05:32
that way um i'm i'm i it didn't stop me from running after him yeah
1:05:39
it says to seek for christ with all of your heart your mind and your soul seek
1:05:44
for him that's a continual what are you thinking today of knowing christ
1:05:50
that would have been even though i had to i had to live a normal life people i had children i have
1:05:55
a husband i had i've worked uh for a good part of my life in the business world and and yet i still with
1:06:03
the passion i had to know him i found time in the middle of the night to after
1:06:08
him and he shook up one day he showed up he's so real he's so real but i'm undone
1:06:15
by the love that i'm before the throne and because there's no nothing in me of
1:06:22
the enemy there's no darkness in me i've i've heard of some people who weren't living right caught up that they they
1:06:28
almost want to scream from the glory and the passion they were feeling they they felt like they knew they weren't living
1:06:35
right but he never has said anything to me i am so like a little child i can't
1:06:40
wait to be with him i am i'm undone by the waves of love that consume they go
1:06:45
through my entire being and i'm living in love that's what it's like to to be in heaven yeah i've heard of people he
1:06:52
sent back they cried because yeah they wanted to be with him
1:06:58
and and that's what we should always go after him for for that reason
1:07:04
and can't you know i i think we've known each other either eight or nine years somewhere in there and when you first
1:07:10
began to preach that you were doing it publicly we were on the cruises where i first met you in person it was your
1:07:15
cruise and we hadn't maybe officially met quite yet i don't know but you were talking
1:07:21
about that you could live without sinning and i thought that's not
1:07:28
possible really i didn't and i and it was a struggle through the years but more and more
1:07:34
i'm coming you know to the realization that most of these things are a choice we choose to sin we just choose to sin
1:07:41
and instead of saying uh i used to pray god help me
1:07:47
not do these things so much and it's not that i heard the lord speak but it would be as if he said well why
1:07:53
don't you just not do those things so much i mean there are things that really are
1:07:58
a choice and i'm learning that more and more but you had to keep saying that like nathaniel like you're saying you i
1:08:05
mean you're the first person that's said that but i watched your life you can get to the point where you're
1:08:10
not you're not ill-willed towards mankind i mean you're not very merciful towards
1:08:16
wickedness and that's that's good that's that's the no guile part too but anyway i you so you're saying you don't have to
1:08:24
live a life of sin you don't have to go through a day and say lord forgive me for what i sin today right
1:08:30
you don't pray that's right that's right he actually said to me one time it tell
1:08:36
he believers to stop crowding up the altars that's for sinners that's that's
1:08:41
for the lost okay if you're born again you shouldn't want to be running down there every sunday to
1:08:46
get faith again people run down there to step into the glory i don't care what they're having you know what's called saying i'm going down to
1:08:52
get the glory i'm going down to get the presence of god you can you can get the more of him i
1:08:59
think is probably what what is what pulls me that way is i've had a taste of him i've had an
1:09:05
experience with him and and it pulls me more towards him and you can have that
1:09:11
because instead of saying god help me not to sin today how about you getting up in the morning and say i refuse to
1:09:16
sin today that's good that's pretty powerful you you command your own day
1:09:23
you do it from the time your eyes open start recognizing father like this
1:09:29
morning i woke up and said father i love you jesus christ my king and my savior i love you holy spirit my best friend i
1:09:36
love you i love being with you i i love listening to your words that you speak
1:09:41
to me i love knowing you and then i start saying i'm not going to tolerate evil around me i won't tolerate
1:09:47
unkindness i will not tolerate injustice you have to not tolerate and i remember
1:09:53
one time specifically even after knowing him for years the father walked through my room and
1:09:59
touched me said i no longer want to see you participate with the enemy and i
1:10:05
don't want you to tolerate the enemy anymore that was a whole new thing to me a whole new thing
1:10:11
participating with the enemy is talking more about him and then talking about god you're advertising or marketing hell
1:10:19
if all you can talk about is that now i did talk about coming against evil and wickedness
1:10:26
over the power of the enemy but i was talking about things going on you know oh well you know this shouldn't be
1:10:31
happening to this person or that or that he told me to stop doing it stop doing that and he said and you don't tolerate
1:10:38
any attacks of the enemy you don't tolerate any actions of the enemy don't tolerate any of the words he tries to
1:10:43
give you that's a whole new level people number one you're not participating so
1:10:48
stop participating by complaining right stop complaining whether you stop
1:10:54
gossiping you're participating with how marketing how when you do those things i wasn't gossiping i was just fed up with
1:11:00
things going on against people who shouldn't be attacked instead of a ship then they're taking authority and
1:11:06
sending the host to do something about it so you look at your life do you complain all the time are you angry all the time
1:11:13
are you god sitting all the time or you're certainly not as a believer bringing glory to god to god by doing
1:11:19
that but you are actually participating so get up in the morning and say i know we'll no longer tolerate the worthy
1:11:25
enemy in my life i will not sin i'm going for sin free
1:11:31
i know i can have it i'm going after that in jesus name you would be so shocked at the help you get from holy
1:11:37
spirit yeah it sounds like you've almost made a when you talk about the joy made
1:11:42
up you made a declaration where you dare to declare decree it will be established it will be established as something you
1:11:49
build on but at least get up and say something don't get up and start chewing on people
1:11:54
maybe you should ask for grace for abundant life when you open your eyes i've been doing that yeah i left that part out so i say hello
1:12:01
father son of holy spirit and then they say father i ask for and receive grace for this day
1:12:06
that is abundant life grace that's not grace eternal i've already got that and i feel electricity
1:12:14
filling me filling me with grace for abundant life and i go out and i'm happy i'm nice to
1:12:22
people it's automatic you've got part of heaven in you and any believer author can say father i ask for and receive
1:12:28
grace for abundant life this day christ i come to bring a life and bring it
1:12:35
abundantly we we it's in the word so i'm just doing the word by saying that you know every
1:12:42
day every 24 hours when when when um if you remember when paul was struggling
1:12:47
with all the things in his life and christ said
1:12:52
that he gives us grace he can give you grace for the day for the evil thereof that's what the word says and you know
1:12:59
what paul learned to ask for that grace he learned through the whole word says
1:13:05
look my grace i've given to you my peace i've given to you he talked about that
1:13:10
grace well he can't give people grace for eternal life but grace for
1:13:16
abundant life is one of the reasons if you're not living abundantly you're not asking for it yeah that's really really
1:13:22
good um and one i wanted to ask this one question and then we'll wrap up with this but
1:13:28
i don't know if you use the word game or if i just thought in my head i can't remember but it's almost like you're
1:13:34
uh maybe before you you're at a point now where it's not much of a problem to send it's probably no problem at all but
1:13:40
i mean people that are striving for it it almost sounds like they make a game out of getting through a day without
1:13:47
sinning if they make an intentionality is that a good goal lord i want to get through the day and i don't want to be
1:13:53
sinning at all is that a goal i think it has to be something that you desire yourself instead of begging god
1:14:00
to help you not to do it you need to start saying i'm not going to do it okay
1:14:05
because you know what happens those words you just spoke will start to come against any sin you
1:14:11
have stored and the thing with this the more you sin the more it goes in your soul within your soul you will choose
1:14:16
you're going to do again and i've used this as an example that's why prisoners go back to prison
1:14:22
and why do they keep committing the crimes it's what's in them they commit the crime it's in their soul they get
1:14:28
out that pulls on them they go do it again it's a vicious cycle why not turn that around
1:14:34
and instead you plant good things in your soul i choose as an act to my will i bind to
1:14:41
my soul god's goodness his authority his will his way i choose life i choose joy
1:14:49
i choose obedience you are laying a platform in your soul for the first time that sin will have a
1:14:57
much harder time trying to get to you and if sin is presented to you when the when the thought comes to sin that's the
1:15:04
devil you say no i don't have that anymore i'm not living that way anymore
1:15:09
it has to come from your mouth you're making a declaration of how you want to
1:15:14
live instead of letting the devil influence you and suck you into the life you want you to have
1:15:20
good good well kat if you feel so loud you want to pray for the people to kind of wrap this
1:15:25
up whatever god gives you awesome so father i just declare over everybody
1:15:31
listening to this or watching this god that they will want your will your way
1:15:36
more than anything else father i just right now impart the life of god the
1:15:42
love of god his will his way his excitement his
1:15:47
expectation over you his plans over you his desire to know you
1:15:55
let it permeate every single person father and i release the anointing that
1:16:00
destroys the yoke of darkness of a lifestyle of sin let it be destroyed in jesus name and instead i impart the life
1:16:08
of god and the light to flood their soul to show them the right way to live i
1:16:13
thank you holy spirit for coming to to pull them into him yes lord let them
1:16:18
have a taste of his presence in jesus name you be free stay free and be
1:16:25
dangerous against hell every day of your life by being kind by doing what's right
1:16:31
because when you learn the joy of obedience you then step into extravagance of god
1:16:37
amen amen amen thank you so much i always like to have you tell people how to get a hold of your two websites
1:16:44
revealingheaven.com is on the screen what can people get there um they can have uh we have our store
1:16:52
there our products our event schedule is there and and then cur.com has a it's a
1:16:57
spiritual platform for god to say whatever he wants to say and there's all kinds of training videos
1:17:03
on there and learn how to ask for the grace for abundant life i just talked about and and by the way you should search out
1:17:10
a scripture in the word that says as a child god filled his son with his grace
1:17:18
where's that which where's that one i'm not telling you go find it [Laughter]
1:17:24
okay i'm not telling you there is a scripture that the father is saying i filled my son with my grace
1:17:30
while he was a child that is grace for abundant life that is why why can christ bring life more
1:17:36
abundantly his father filled him with that grace christ you need to get saved people okay
1:17:44
he didn't have to fill him with grace for eternal life he filled jesus christ
1:17:50
as a child with grace for abundant life and he walked in that abundant life grace his entire life
1:17:56
that's good now you also have catker.com tell people about that one catker
1:18:02
i forgot what i was saying yeah no uh well yeah so no you're doing it.com yeah.com is where you can watch all
1:18:09
kinds of tutorial videos and and hear testimonies and interviews and it is the
1:18:15
only place i'm playing the earth that you can give to me online there's no other way to do that
1:18:21
and it's called the go to category.com click on the treasury and you can give whenever you want to or you can become a
1:18:27
member of the guardian zone who are my friends those are my regular supporters and i bless them i pray for god to
1:18:34
increase them a thousand-fold return that's not just baiting you to become one that's just saying i have a
1:18:41
relationship with the people who support me and support heaven's plan to reveal heaven on the earth i'm very grateful
1:18:49
and by the way why not try a whole day just being grateful you will bless the heart of god
1:18:55
that's good very very good cat blessings to you and your team give our love to your team we see jen every
1:19:01
morning to start and i actually have some everybody say hi oh that's a big ground oh that's a good
1:19:09
well that yeah i hope i will support that because that costs a lot of um
1:19:15
money to support those groups just plain and simple so i don't know doesn't i tell i try to explain to people all the
1:19:21
time you know the church gets bashed more than any anything else about money okay
1:19:26
okay they know the one who makes money who money came from wealth comes from god christ died and we might be rich
1:19:32
okay wealth is in heaven if you want to be poor maybe you should rethink going there no
1:19:38
i'm joking but heaven is extravagant and all that they have or they give you
1:19:44
we can be extravagant if we have wealth it's i would look at wealth as a way to
1:19:50
help to grow people to rescue uh that's what wealth
1:19:55
is to me when i get money i get so excited because it means i can help somebody or i can give somewhere or do
1:20:00
something with it if you look at it that way he'll give you unlimited that's so good yeah these days i'm
1:20:06
looking at wealth uh you know as you know as people support i go i can deal i can drill three more
1:20:12
wells this month and i can go in there yeah i mean you know you're getting places when when
1:20:18
that's where it takes you instead of like going to buy a car or something like that that's that one you can have a
1:20:23
good car yeah it is right and i don't mean yeah but i'm just saying i've had fun getting to the place where
1:20:29
it's really jazzy fun to start isn't it when i get when i when jen says these
1:20:36
these chokes came and i go yeah yeah my soul gets excited because i can help and i can give
1:20:42
and that is that's that was the way my father was my grandmother was and so but i love i love
1:20:48
to give yeah and uh it is the greatest thing to to consider others more highly
1:20:54
than yourself and i god doesn't have a problem with me buying clothes i'm for the first time
1:20:59
going to own a home instead of living in our office and then and then our plan we
1:21:05
will have an office building so we are going towards expanding in many ways
1:21:10
and and guess what it does cost money and we know the one who has all of it but he does love to use people so they
1:21:17
will get blessed and be a part of something and while you're at it make sure you give something to elijah's
1:21:22
dreams because if it wasn't for steve i wouldn't be here right now i think this is week almost week 70 almost crazy it's
1:21:30
way up there he had bringing this non-stop for all of these weeks that was god's plan we just said yes
1:21:38
and so remember why you get blessed make sure you've given help oh thank you if you're part of a church and your pastor
1:21:44
is still blessing you and a part of your life make sure you're blessing him that's
1:21:50

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 71 - Heaven 101!

or https://youtu.be/u7F74OR5CKg

1:34
hey well happy wednesday april 6 already 2022 i'm steve schultz welcome to the
1:40
broadcast you are you are on elijah streams and we have elijah list.com on
1:45
the screen because that's where you sign up for the list so that we can keep you informed after the show today and every
1:51
day we have a show uh within an hour or two we will send you the broadcast by email with the links the description the
1:58
photos everything so be sure you're on elijah list.com but you are watching elijah's streams
2:04
we are in year 25 of bringing the voice of the prophets to you between the two lists and of course beyond that you have
2:11
we have all the other social media but uh and again anyway welcome to the broadcast now i have a very important
2:17
announcement to make uh and i'm gonna in a minute i'm going to call for the scripture but
2:23
we always have every single time we do a show or something on the elijah's we will
2:29
have some who believe this is the word of the lord and some who believe it's not the word of the lord and what i want to kind of
2:36
drill into us is that that's exactly the way it's supposed to be we're to decide
2:42
for ourselves if it's a word from the lord or not now yesterday we had an unprecedented number of
2:48
polarized views some people loved it they said i just want to know tell me the hard stuff so i can prepare and of
2:54
course a lot of these people have maybe have money and things like that so that they can prepare
3:01
and then there's people that wrote and said how am i supposed to get ready i don't have any money i'm 70 years old i live little and all of that
3:07
we had a lot of people more way way way more than normal that said
3:13
that they they saw the word they didn't think we should have had that word on they thought we
3:19
that that wasn't correct that they didn't identify with it so here's one i want to say uh let me pull up that go
3:24
ahead and pull up that scripture uh emily if you're the one whoever's doing that okay here's a scripture in first corinthians 14 29 and i've i've brought
3:32
this up many times when people write personally two or three prophets should speak and
3:38
the other should weigh carefully or judge depending on the version of the bible you have what is said
3:44
now yesterday you all did exactly what you were supposed to do
3:49
scripturally some of you judged it to be absolutely a word from the lord and you you weighed
3:55
it you felt good about it and you and you adhered to it whatever the word would be others of you
4:02
absolutely keep that go ahead and keep that up there for a little bit just another minute or two others of you
4:07
judged it as not from the lord it didn't bear witness with you you thought it shouldn't have
4:13
been on the air so um again i want you whichever place you found yourself on
4:21
you obeyed scripture because if we if we could put a little more natural language we would say and
4:27
the others should weigh carefully for themselves
4:33
uh what what is true or they should judge for themselves what
4:39
is said and so you all did that but each of you wanted us to not do the
4:46
other thing if you didn't like it you didn't want us to put it on if you loved it you wanted us to put it on so it's on
4:52
we can't pull that back but i want to hear i want to compliment you for obeying scripture and doing
4:59
doing what the word said you weighed carefully and you arrived at a conclusion now some of the words in
5:05
there that i that and i'm kind of in the middle frankly because there were headlines there one
5:11
of the a prophet got in touch with me and said uh his discernment was that some of the
5:17
headlines that chris reed read were actually accurately read but it was what
5:23
the um what we were supposed to pray against it was what the enemy planned
5:28
but not what god planned so i don't know i'm in the middle on that i don't know which way i i
5:35
mentioned yesterday on the program that we have uh food for two to two to three weeks we've got food here and probably
5:42
extras for our kids if anything happened and we've got uh i have a safe so i put a little bit of cash there in the safe
5:48
and our gas we try to keep our gasoline filled because of the supply supply change we've been talking about this for
5:54
months because of the supply chain and the shortage on that so between food
5:59
and gasoline that's how you prepare and when you go shopping get an extra can every time you go shopping you know
6:06
maybe two cans or something so you begin to stock up so for the nice lady that wrote she says i'm 70 years old what am
6:12
i supposed to do well each time you shop get an extra can or two the lord doesn't
6:17
warn you the night before he warns you in a season before so that you have time
6:23
to prepare so i hope that that is clear
6:28
johnny enlo pointed out to me he contacted me this morning he said by virtue of the fact you were saying don't
6:35
be afraid now now don't be afraid it's almost like we invited people to be afraid you know he
6:41
has a good point in that we didn't mean to do that but some people heard me say that and said oh man this must be
6:47
something to be really afraid of so um yeah so maybe next time i won't emphasize don't be afraid because i kind
6:54
of had the opposite but i really wanted you all to see that and know that and if
6:59
you decided that this word was not for you you don't discern us from the lord
7:05
just ignore it don't don't even worry about it just just ignore it just say that one wasn't
7:10
for me i think steve blew it by bringing that word on and the people that love the word then just keep loving it you
7:17
know and that's good you're all being scriptured all right it's 11 11 behind me that's a prophetic number all right
7:23
now i want to talk just for a minute before we bring kat on you all know that we've drilled the wells in uganda and we're drilling that
7:30
we're now researching drilling wells for the native american people here in the united states
7:35
what we need you to do and go ahead and bring that that email up mike sally has taken mike
7:41
and laurie sally have taken on the task to help us find locations where water wells are needed
7:47
and i was stunned to find out how much water how many water wells i needed among the first nations people
7:52
throughout the united states we had started with the navajo nations we still haven't necessarily found the solution so
8:00
what we need you to do and i'll just read this if you know of pastors and i mean native american pastors on on
8:07
a reservation who know about their need for water for the first nations people and i included the navajo because we
8:13
were trying to find something for the navajo down in new mexico and arizona just email mike sally just mike
8:20
sallywater gmail.com we're leaving it there for a minute so that you you can see it so we really really want
8:27
to help but we know that the issues among the first nations people are
8:32
different than in uganda you find a place they need a well here it's a village you don't you you don't
8:37
particularly get permits it is a drill and there it is there's there are tribal councils and
8:43
there are elders and there's chiefs and they they have a protocol that we have to follow that's
8:49
why we find a pastor in it it doesn't have to be a pastor it could be a native
8:55
american we we had we were up in south dakota um calling up there mike was and there was
9:00
a i i don't know if you called him an elder but he wasn't he's not a pastor but he was a great contact up in the
9:07
south dakota area that they're working on finding solutions for water so we're making
9:13
calls so go ahead and email mike sallywater gmail.com and maybe what
9:19
you do maybe the maybe the email that you write will be the one that ends up getting the native
9:24
peoples and on some of these reservations some great water so let god use you in that way so
9:30
all right well god bless you it's time to bring kat in here good morning cat good morning so we did
9:38
a little house cleaning today and uh what are your thoughts do you have any thoughts about what you heard as far as
9:44
i actually didn't hear any of it on purpose so you'll have to tell me what it is okay well we can judge by what man
9:51
is saying and i will tell you this not knowing what any of it is i don't interpret dreams i'm a prophet i
9:59
say what god says that's good and i tell you what he showed me when i woke up this morning
10:04
before we say anything the father said make sure you tell everyone to still in
10:09
this time it is still a time to celebrate good and only celebration is
10:16
coming people before one word is spoken to me this is a time of acceleration into the great things of god this is not
10:23
stepping backward waiting and hoping that the enemy does not attack you so now you may say what you want to say
10:28
yeah well that's good and well because it was a dream i don't have to tell you the dream because you don't interpret dreams well let me ask you this
10:35
um you in the in one of the dreams part of the interpretation was that the military may have to take over at some
10:41
point um and that there would be some time of jubilee i personally think those two
10:47
things are probably correct has the lord told you about the military coming or a
10:52
time of jubilee that's coming to us like debt cancellation and that kind of military did come it wouldn't be for war
10:59
right it wouldn't be to fire weapons right so i don't know what the other
11:05
45 is actually going to do i will just tell you what god has said there will be no world wars there'll be
11:11
no world war three this is a time of great celebration and the whole exposure
11:17
of the darkness is wise being shown the darkness is not crawling and creeping out of every crack so they can try to
11:23
take over and kill us all this is the time for them to be exposed so they can
11:28
be taken down okay not the just not the righteous this is not the day of his wrath this is day
11:35
of his power and i will also say this when something comes from a group who doesn't even know
11:41
what timing is on god's timeline then what will come out of their soul may be
11:46
something that ends up more towards the end of the bible than in than what's in the heart of god so i don't speak
11:53
according to what it's at the end of the bible people that's not what's happening at all if that's only been put in your
11:58
soul that's what you've been waiting on or living on then everything you speak that comes out of the soul profit or not
12:04
profit that's going to be geared towards that happening in other words they can see
12:10
the possibility or even dream about the possibility that the end is coming or or
12:16
taste or the pre um cursor to the end we're not getting the precursor to the
12:21
end of this country what we're going to get as a precursor to the millennial reign of christ is what is about to happen
12:29
to christ a taste of that happening so no matter what people dream by the way dreams can be messed with really really
12:36
well by the end of me let me interpret dreams i can only adamantly say what he showed me would
12:43
happen and when i woke up this was his word for everyone watching regardless of anything that was spoken to me this is
12:49
still a time and all that i hope by what god said to eat cake and
12:57
celebrate people a celebration does not sound to me like everything is going to go downhill we have to hide in holes
13:05
if you want to keep extra stuff in your pantry that's up to you the holy spirit just said that to me again not knowing
13:10
what was said i on purpose did not listen that's good i'm proud of you too you can't i will
13:15
paint three maybe you'll have guests drop by when the other thing never happens that people have said will happen i'm just saying right now from
13:23
god himself this is a time of celebration for i have said in these
13:28
days greatness will be seen upon the earth the darkness will be crushed and pushed back no man will take over this
13:35
earth no man will take over this country the villain sitting in that seat will be ejected and rejected and his words will
13:43
become dust and the words of those who speak against the time i have appointed to happen their words will be dust also
13:51
so very count closely the word you're believing and after that will live by it
13:56
may take you off the path i have put you on to go into greatness and acceleration
14:02
into great power might and wealth for that is what i have purpose and nothing
14:07
else have i purpose stop getting tired of waiting on what i'm going to do i
14:13
have the perfect time because time comes from me not man so when you hear the words of a man over
14:19
here the heart will heal the words that i have purpose from my own throne that these are days of greatness and glory
14:27
not demon gloom not stepping back not getting off the track but being prepared
14:32
quickly into the destiny i have for this country this world in each and every one
14:38
of your lives for if the words don't give you inspiration empowerment and they begin to put fear in you they are
14:45
not from me because perfect love casts out fear it doesn't create it it doesn't
14:50
advertise it it doesn't market it those words are not for me if they have brought fear to your soul says your god
14:57
that's good wildcat that was good i love it when the spirit comes on you like that that's good you know it may wear
15:04
you out but it encourages us to hear a great word like that so yeah i think you're right on time and by the way
15:10
thank you for being so um diligent is the word having so much
15:15
integrity not to listen what you knew you weren't supposed to listen to i didn't hear anything yeah so you had
15:20
your staff cut that off so you couldn't see it yeah and that's good you know i've watched you cat on flashpoint and
15:26
they're going around well what do you think lance and what do you think hank and what do you think and they'll come
15:33
to you and you'll go i don't do panels i just tell you what god says and then you launch into it so
15:39
i do add one little thing yeah i read the scripture that was put up there and people have always uh
15:46
not taken that for revelation on i'm telling you it says let two or three prophets speak
15:52
and then let the others the others are not humans or people they're prophets
15:58
let the other prophets judge okay not the people okay no what other people
16:03
are thinking trying to figure out why that two or two or three prophets you know they speak what god has said the
16:10
other prophets get the true prophets yeah the ones who've jumped off the thing and thrown their self under the
16:16
car uh i'm done by the true prophecy god judge what those words are so if you heard a prophet respond
16:24
in the way that i just god just spoke to you that prophet was correct oh that's good yeah and yeah people
16:31
we put on most of the people we put on our prophets but some are prophetic
16:37
people they don't call themselves prophets ironically johnny enla who's one of the most accurate prophets i've
16:42
ever met does not call himself a prophet he is he's a prophet but you know other people you know i i get i'm a member of
16:49
different lists and some some are just those that prophesy they're not they're they don't have the anointing level
16:56
uh like you johnny and all those that i don't know but when you sit in the office
17:02
the office means a seat with that name on it that god put on there
17:08
that is a true prophet you can be prophetic you can be a prophetic in the bible whatever but a prophet that sits
17:15
in the office of a prophet and accurately speaks what god is saying
17:21
there is an anointing on that not just annoying there's power on it it pierces
17:26
the darkness it pierces anything the enemies tried to plant people's souls and there's no way you can deny that
17:32
presence you can't fake the presence of god right so if a prophet has responded to what was said and they didn't agree
17:39
with doom and gloom or whatever that was that prophet was very accurate that's good very very good well i'm going to go
17:46
out and get some more chocolate cake that's my favorite kind i love it you know i had and
17:52
i had drinks and we're trying to do our diet and i said dream get me some chocolate cake
17:57
you know it was it was so good just these really big ones and i had her cut it in half and then then i kind of make
18:04
it last but even the halves are pretty big but there's nothing cupcakes make cupcakes
18:11
i don't know there was a time when chocolate was hardly in the united states i've seen some of the specials about that i don't know how this country
18:18
lived without chocolate you know hershey hershey came along boy talk about an anointed gift from god by the way if
18:25
he's in heaven what would someone like hershey do in heaven make candy
18:32
i knew you'd say that i'm going there he'd have candy he'd have a candy shop
18:37
that's what he had oh man yeah yeah so that's good by the way um prophets use you know even the
18:45
scripture says as for prophecy it will cease so if a prophet and that's has been his
18:50
or her whole life almost from childhood their seer their prophet so when they get to heaven what and we're going to
18:56
talk about heaven in just a minute here um but what would the what would a prophet
19:02
do if so that particular gift is not needed it would be their hobby okay
19:08
i will be a photographer in heaven i i i carry the title of revelator prophet
19:14
king in the spirit realm you know commander of the host i mean i have a lot of titles that when i get to heaven they
19:20
won't be needed i just won't be doing that but what i will be doing is my passion with the thing that i would love
19:27
to do most of the time if i could would be a photographer so i am a photographer
19:32
who happens at this time to be a prophet and people do ask you a lot in heaven about the pr the prophecies that were
19:38
doing how undone they were and awesome but you'll be doing that as you're taking pictures if you're a
19:44
photographer okay uh maybe i don't know uh rodeo king
19:50
whatever golfers for some reason a lot of people in the ministry are in law there's no lawyers need or no doctors
19:56
needed um so whatever their passion maybe it's fishing maybe it's golfing maybe it's creating maybe if it's art
20:03
that they have a side thing that they love to do it's what the gift is god made you everybody has a gift even if
20:10
you haven't identified it it could be a you know it could be someone singing an opera it could be and you always wanted
20:16
to do that play some instrument and that's your whole passion you think about it all the time you will be doing
20:22
that and your whole mansion will be designed around that gift so that's why the gifts the gifts that are irrevocable
20:28
aren't talking about spiritual gifts people they're talking about the gifts we need to operate and have things on
20:33
this earth you do all that for fun in heaven and there's no charge everything is given to you so you actually never
20:40
miss your destiny not even the babies because when he sent them he put a gift in them wrote it on them so whatever
20:47
they're supposed to be they will be that in heaven as eventually when they grow up wow well so before you came on and uh
20:55
the lord was saying that for the last 24 hours have cat start from the beginning because there's
21:01
been thousands literally hundreds of thousands because we have 1.2 million
21:06
different viewers in it every 90 day period so there's been hundreds of thousands who have never heard
21:12
the initial what you call what is it heaven 101 is that what you call it uh well there's many things god sometimes
21:19
calls it the big picture about and actually i will probably start before the earth was made we won't take
21:25
too long doing it because the only big picture is where did you come from okay
21:31
where did you come from where did i come from where did we all come from we all came from the same place so do you just
21:36
want me to start yeah go for it cat just go for it uh well there's a scripture in the bible that says in him
21:42
we live we move we have our very being that means existence of the prophets and
21:49
poets of all the ancient days have spoken of these things that's actually in the bible that's not talking about
21:56
jesus people jesus didn't carry all of us inside of him like a mother uh that
22:01
would be the father that's why he's called the father uh the father god we all were in him we were little our
22:08
little spirits were in him yes it was your spirit everybody has a spiritual body we all lived in him we moved in and
22:14
out on the on the rays of the rainbow that's in him we live we move you move out you can only go as far as that
22:19
rainbow goes back in him it's very uh the rainbow around the throne of god is not stagnant it's a lie it moves it
22:27
looks like the aurora borealis which i love the aurora borealis it represents
22:32
how the rainbow moves in and out of the father and we as little spirits inside of him would jump on it we would jump on
22:38
it ride it out as far as it would go we would ride back in like like a fun ride
22:44
we played in the river of life that comes from him every single one whoever was on this earth came from that place
22:52
there's no other one that creators have brought us to the earth he sent us with a purpose the purpose
22:59
was to be the gift he made you to be so that's why we have so many things we
23:05
have designers we have people who grow things who flourish i mean i the list is unending that that everyone has a gift
23:13
the best barbecue ever in this world whatever people who love to cook that's their passion and right now the major
23:20
shows i'm going to jump ahead the major shows anywhere online or on television
23:26
are people who have a gift whether it's remodeling things or cooking things
23:31
baking things creating things those shows that honor the people with
23:37
these gifts they they get you know they get judged and then they win things or whatever people want to know
23:43
what it is you do and if you're really good you don't usually have to advertise yourself
23:49
people will be drawn to you because of that gift well in heaven everybody gets to use
23:54
that gift god said go back to the beginning so the beginning before the earth was made there was the father's
24:00
house the father's house it talks about it's not a building it is a world
24:08
bigger than our entire galaxy wow the earth is round people it's not flat
24:14
i've been in heaven so many times i did lose count after the third first 1 000 times i do have a commission
24:20
and yes that jesus came in person to tell me the father and he were going to start taking me on tours of heaven they
24:26
wanted to reveal heaven to earth i never asked for this commission now i have to let you know it's not my gift
24:32
that's a temporary position but it is a commission and so they take me whenever they want to they take me back before
24:39
time began so i love it in genesis 1 1 people don't really understand what that means in the
24:45
beginning okay in the beginning the heavens that word the heavens and
24:51
the earth that is not the world called heaven the world called heaven has always always existed even before time
24:59
so in the beginning means at the beginning of time when god made the physical realm and wrapped it
25:04
around the whole spiritual realm that's the beginning we're talking about so before that bt before time we lived in
25:12
the father the angel tribes were being created by the father by the by the son
25:18
whose name was the word back then the word the holy spirit and the father they work together that's why they're the
25:24
three in one they have the ability to step inside of each other and i'll just
25:29
tell you the way the father showed me he took me to heaven one time and he said well we really want to do something
25:35
about people thinking we're a three-headed god are people not understanding who we are so this is how
25:40
we show you so i'm standing there before the throne of god which i'm always undone by his love i'm like i'm eight
25:46
years old people so anybody can understand this and there's a father sitting on the throne glorious there's
25:52
uh the word his son next to him sitting next to him the holy spirit's on the left side of the throne
26:00
where the reservoir or the oil of the spirit is kept by the way just an extra little thing
26:06
and so the father said we are the godhead and then all of a sudden he just he made
26:12
this little shout and and jesus gets up and steps literally inside the father
26:17
totally disappears and the holy spirit comes and steps inside the father
26:22
and then the father does this we are the three in one and i'm like i know could understand that
26:29
and then and then then the holy spirit steps out and comes to the left side of the throne jesus comes out and sits next
26:35
to the father he said we are the godhead bodily so this is what jesus did
26:42
this is what jesus meant when he said don't you know i'm in the father and he's in me that's it he's just gonna
26:48
talk about that scripture oh okay sorry god you and me and me and you uh may
26:53
they be one even as we are one when you go to heaven
26:58
people jesus will step inside the father holy spirit steps inside the father and you
27:04
standing before the throne will step inside the father wow i hope that does something to you yeah i
27:10
mean that's like huge because it always i always thought it was metaphoric or poetic or you know we're so unified that
27:17
he's in me and i knew oh no literally and when he says you invite christ to indwell you christ a
27:24
layer now this is the thing you have to understand the the divine the divinity the three
27:29
the godhead they have unlimited layers of their self that doesn't mean you'll
27:35
see 50 layers of them displayed in heaven although they could do that or a thousand or ten thousand are unlimited
27:41
but your soul is made in their image when god said let us make man in our
27:47
image the way they're designed the way they weren't creator mermaid they just always existed like that
27:53
but inside of their own soul there are layers of themselves so when you invite
27:59
christ into your life he takes a layer of his own soul and puts it inside of you and he is
28:06
indwelling you when you give yourself to jesus christ he reaches inside of you this is like
28:12
now takes a layer of your soul that looks just like you and he seats in heavenly places
28:18
so you literally are there a part of you there a part of your soul you gave it to him is seated in heavenly places i could
28:25
see myself i mean you can see yourself right now sitting on a little throne somewhere really really
28:32
yes as a cat is this what it means when you know when people say well you need to you need to
28:38
declare a decree from a third heaven perspective because you realize you're actually there in some
28:45
yes and let me tell you that layer of your soul it's still you it looks just like you talks acts like you of course
28:52
in heaven there's no you know there's no slip ups and no there's no profanity there's no there's no hate there's no
28:58
anger there's no wickedness no evil soul that lay of your soul never experiences that you know down here and there's
29:05
where bombarded i'm getting way ahead of everything so let's go back let's go back to those
29:10
okay so the father and and the word and holy spirit had this big meeting together and
29:17
at that point we were all still in the father now it was no surprise the word
29:23
jesus christ knew we lived in the father he he knew that holy spirit knew we
29:29
lived in the father because it's very evident you see us little spirits run flying out and you know on the little
29:35
rainbow one thing not little i'm sorry the the beams or the waves of the rainbow
29:41
that comes from god they knew we lived in him besides remember when they stepped inside
29:47
they saw us inside now you have to picture the father as having if you step
29:52
inside or could peek inside you see no end to his being it is not a human he's not a human and
30:00
we we mistakenly say oh he looks like a human no no no you're wrong go way back
30:06
we look like him because he has a head he has arms a leg he's got a torso we
30:11
were made in their image so they don't look like creatures father son holy spirit don't look like creatures they they look like
30:18
real beings the divine the divinity okay they have a face it's the wrong they
30:23
have they can they can move and go places new things of course things we can't do but the father always had a plan
30:31
to make a place now this is all spirit realm so your little spirit person
30:36
didn't need to have oxygen to breathe it didn't need to be fed or anything and
30:41
you actually didn't have to make many decisions when you lived in him except am i going to ride on the next ray that
30:47
leaves god am i swim in the river of life and in in the father and that we we
30:53
knew we were his offspring we knew it that made us different than the angels the angels were actually created in
31:00
tribes they were they were the first tribes not not the israelites the first tribes were the angelic tribes
31:08
we won't go into the whole history about the angelic tribes they they went through a lot of stuff too when lucifer
31:13
tried to take over later but so so this is what heaven was like it was beautiful
31:19
things beyond your imagination the ability to do things in heaven that you can't do on the earth even now you ride
31:26
on light in heaven you ride on you ride yourself on the rainbow you shout glory to god and a rainbow comes out of your
31:31
mouth in heaven and you walk across the crystal sea on it this is life in heaven this is what life is like before he made
31:38
the earth uh he knew there would be things that would happen he knew that we would be in we would have flesh on us
31:45
but instead of having us forever and ever just having little spiritual uh bodies he wanted us to have a physical
31:52
body that was our it was all our own you are his sons and daughters you were
31:58
his sons and daughters when you lived in him and you were sent to earth and yes you if you got married you you were
32:05
married because it takes two of us together to create children a man and a woman not two men or two men
32:13
we'll throw that in for free the father designed it that way for a purpose but he decided finally let's start doing
32:22
this and so they would go somewhere where there was nothing and and the father would speak a word
32:28
from his mouth like physical realm and then the word would make that
32:33
physical realm he actually took a scroll out and and rolled this whole physical
32:38
realm around a part of the spirit realm and on that canvas the physical realm uh
32:45
god began to speak about the planets and the stars and he didn't make the sun or the moon
32:50
yet at that time because the earth in the beginning was lit with his glory
32:56
okay the first earth which is still the one where was lit with the glory of god there was no sun or moon uh when it was
33:03
first made okay and so the word made the physical round they began to put the planets out there
33:09
the stars the nebulas began to create this very beautiful background
33:15
for for for time to begin for time to begin and then when the father was ready
33:21
uh of course during that little break in there uh lucifer was cast out of heaven
33:26
at one point because he tried to do the big takeover does that sound familiar
33:32
this is what heaven's doing that's what they laugh at the left at
33:37
the liberals of the evil wicked they're laughing because they're like little pieces of dust on this earth thinking
33:42
the god i mean he holds the air they breathe people
33:48
he does hold the air they breathe so but but he decided is let's go ahead and do this and so he
33:54
made the earth and he lifted with his glory the original earth was lit with the glory of
34:00
god we were still inside the father by the way he's been from the beginning to the end
34:06
and then to the beginning and before he made the earth you went with him really
34:11
whoever left the father we we didn't live somewhere else in heaven we always lived in him so when the father went to
34:17
the end we were with him when he went back you were with him you've actually
34:23
seen before time when god was back there you were with him
34:28
i know that may be difficult you're saying we didn't he and therefore we he didn't just see the end and notice like
34:35
he went there yes not as if it was the end he actually
34:40
went to the end right of time and when i say the beginning
34:46
when the bible says the beginning that's the beginning of time not the beginning of god or the word or all of heaven
34:53
itself the world called heaven his house has always existed the beginning the word which is in the beginning is when
34:59
time began when they started counting time when there was different hours of the day and all that started so the end
35:07
of time means they won't need time anymore that doesn't mean things will stop existing by the way you'll you'll
35:13
always exist and that's why it's important to know who you're going to exist with you get lakeside property where it's fire all
35:19
the time or you get the glorious world called heaven until he makes the new earth so this is our beginning literally
35:25
that's where we came from everyone that says he is our father we are his offspring we lived and played in him and
35:33
he began to write on the soul of each one of these little beings what they would be
35:40
when they came to the earth he even wrote on your soul i know the scientists say well it depends on father mother
35:46
whatever what you know what um gender they're going to be and everything like that but the father
35:52
already knew he wrote it on your soul remember he wrote that book about you uh he wrote on your soul like male female
35:58
whatever and so at the time when the earth was made and he was done with that
36:04
earth the first time of course it was being destroyed by satan so it says in
36:09
the bible god turned the lights out and that's when the waters were covering the earth
36:15
when god made the earth originally i'm going to try to keep it short when he made the earth originally
36:20
there was no rain there was no raining on the earth like raindrops on the earth so when he made it he lit it with his
36:27
glory he put a water vapor shield up way out in the sky around this whole
36:33
earth so it was like in this bubble and there was layers of moisture and
36:39
water so the sky of the earth was even different back then it was like a pinky peach because the light came from the
36:46
earth itself it would meet this this misty uh a thing was put around the earth and it was like
36:53
a peachy glow is this what it was referred to as the firmament is this what you mean is this the firmament
37:00
where it is the permanent the burma is part of what we would call the sky or the atmosphere around the earth but the
37:07
reason why he had to do that was he put dinosaurs not satan the saint clinton satan couldn't create a leaf people okay
37:14
god put dinosaurs on the earth when he made it the first time so the water vapor shield had to be there because
37:21
remember this is now a physical realm uh it had spirit realm in it but it was a physical realm these are physical
37:27
dinosaurs he put on the earth they have the evidence of their bones and by the way that footstep they find was not
37:33
cro-magnon man that was a watcher angle there's a whole tribe of angels that have flesh on them they were assigned to
37:40
the first earth to watch over all of the um the flowers could be a hundred foot
37:45
high trees could be three or four hundred feet high within on the earth at that time
37:50
and they were sent there to take care of those to care for the dinosaurs who were very friendly
37:55
and then of course we all know something happened when lucifer tried as big get take over thinking god didn't know what
38:00
was going on and guess what happened he knew exactly what was going on and when that when the right moment came
38:08
uh lucifer no longer had the ability to influence in heaven to lead worship in heaven
38:16
he was cast out of heaven to the earth and it says in jeremiah that satan began to make the earth a wilderness so god
38:22
turned the light out so yes it's in there people that means he removed his glory off the earth he broke the water
38:30
vapor shield that was twice as much water around the earth it hit the earth
38:35
it broke into the different continents overlapping in many places that's why they know that out in the desert they
38:42
knew at one time that was an ocean they can't explain i just explained it because i was shown how that happened
38:48
so when god decides so here's the earth covered in water and it says that in
38:55
verse two so verse one it was made verse two something has happened right it's in
39:01
darkness the spirit of god is hovering over the waters which are covering everything they're covering the sky
39:06
they're covering the land he begins to take it apart it says so in the bible he began to lift the water off and to
39:12
expose the firmament he took the furman up above the earth again and he began to re-make the earth so the next time he
39:20
makes it was when they put man on it they decided to create all the creatures they made all the creatures we
39:26
didn't come out of a slug out of a pond somewhere people we can't believe in god and so he began to send uh the little
39:34
spirits of life of course we all know in the garden of eden or east of eden is the correct way to say that the garden
39:41
was east of eden and it was a beautiful place and of course we know that he
39:46
created adam's body there was no life in that body but guess what the bible says the father now we
39:52
know the word made the body the word made that body and you should listen to how robin bullock describes that is
39:58
quite fascinating yeah it is fascinating but there was actually uh a mold made
40:03
he made a mold and then late in that moment and so anyway so so the word was jesus made adam's body but there was no
40:11
life in that body until the father leans over and breathes into
40:16
the nostrils of adam a spirit of life that was adam's little spirit that was
40:22
living in the father and when he breathed it in it said adam became a
40:27
living soul how about that it didn't say human being being a living soul your soul is very important and that's how
40:33
adam was made and then of course god realized as things went by that adam
40:38
needed a lot of help so we are the helpers us men us men do need
40:45
the actual helpers and the people people yeah
40:52
need some women to help us yeah that's what he said i need another
40:57
part okay so he takes adam's rib out and makes eve from that rib which means
41:03
we're supposed to be together people okay uh out i need to give you stop and give you a little tip when you die if
41:09
you're married it's okay you live right next to each other but when you left heaven and were sent to the earth you
41:15
were god's son or daughter whether you're a male or female son or daughter when you go home to heaven
41:21
it says when you're married till death do us part what does that mean that means you will no longer be married
41:26
because you have to go home as his son or his daughter because he's making a
41:32
mansion for every son and daughter is fine that all the families live in mansions uh next to each other or
41:38
connect sometimes don't don't be concerned about that be so excited that you're part of the glory and the light
41:44
and life forever with him and so that's how this whole thing started we came from him he timed our
41:51
birth on the earth and so after that man began to cover the earth uh uh and uh we
41:57
know the other times that what happened to your history talks about that but you need to know where you came from
42:03
everyone has a soul that soul is your mind what you think about your will is
42:08
so important is what you choose you don't choose once in a while you're choosing every minute of every day what
42:15
you will say what you will do what you will display and by those actions you put out there
42:22
you're showing people who and what you believe in so if you're manifesting for god out of
42:28
this mouth should be life should be the love of god it should bring hope it
42:33
should bring excitement it should bring empowerment uh that's what we should say as sons and daughters of god that's what
42:40
we're here for and so but the other side who wants to live in the darkness promote the
42:45
darkness and then be evil the more evil you get you don't just want to hear about or talk about you actually want to
42:51
do the evil because you're filling your soul with that with that evil you're feeling it full of darkness
42:57
and when i walk by people i already know if they know christ there's no light in them they're not one ray of light in
43:02
them and the stronger believer you are you have it comes out of you
43:08
because when you choose christ as a believer when you choose him to be your
43:13
lord your savior at that at that very moment in time when you choose that and you say yes to him
43:20
you repent of your sins your name there is an actual book in heaven that the father opens this massive book and he
43:27
writes your name in that book and so that's how that happens that's not all that happens
43:33
when you are born again christ takes a deposit of the anointing that he carries and he puts it in your soul and
43:42
it lives there first john 2 27 there is a scripture for you
43:47
when you receive jesus christ as your savior you get a deposit of the anointing and it abides in you that is
43:53
in the word of god what is the anointing it is a weapon it's a weapon against darkness it breaks
43:59
the yoke of darkness you release it everywhere peter released so much it didn't it wasn't his shadow that healed
44:06
people it was the cloud of the anointing the more you release the anointing the more that cloud of that anointing that
44:12
you carry comes from you i'm not talking about someone who's anointed to sing
44:17
someone who has a really wonderful anointing on their life to create things that's a whole different anointing but
44:24
the anointing you get when you're born again that is the deposit of the anointing christ walked in because we
44:30
are joint heirs with him and he said the things i did you will do also so he actually gave us a deposit of his
44:37
anointing when you are born again the father takes a stone of fire from
44:42
himself puts it in your spirit and it gives your spirit light because remember
44:48
before that there's no light in you so someone who just got born again you have a light of god coming from you you're
44:54
carrying the anointing and people hand you a little bible and say good luck
45:00
and yet that's not all there is that's just the beginning of your journey with christ and know him more to pursue to
45:06
know him more but when you're born again you really are born again angels record it they
45:12
take it up to heaven it's given to the father no the father doesn't need anyone to record it but he likes to do certain
45:19
things he likes to do things together with people he liked to do things with christ and or with the word and so you
45:27
literally lived in him moved in and out and right now going up to heaven i still
45:32
see and i'm gonna give you uh give you a little tip jesse to plant us all right
45:37
up to the throne he saw the little spirits of life he saw them going in and out of the father
45:43
he saw it himself a little girl was caught up to heaven and she came back and told her parents i saw fireflies
45:50
because your spirit man is made out of light i saw fireflies coming out of god in and out of him so there's other
45:57
witnesses to that so we all came from there whether you believe in him or
46:02
trust him or want to know him that is where you came from no one came from
46:07
some other world there's no other place that god started then abandoned there's heaven
46:13
there's earth there's all the physical realm and just let's jump to the whole end
46:19
when time is no more he's going to roll it up why
46:25
it even says you'll roll it up it does he knows where the ends of the physical realm are he's going to roll him up
46:32
he'll make a new worth why because the heaven is the father's house he's making a new earth and the father
46:40
is going to move from heaven to the new earth it will be our home together so
46:45
even when time is no more we will never stop existing we'll never stop again
46:51
and jesus knows the thoughts and intents of every person's heart on this planet
46:56
no one's hiding no one's getting away with anything and that's why i can boldly say what's coming next is not the
47:05
rapture it's not the perilous times it is not the tribulation it's called
47:11
justice justice against the evil and the darkness has been trying to take this country and take this world if you're
47:17
out there you're from some other country even believe in god keep celebrating people because it's going to happen
47:24
heaven is the most glorious place ever from the moment let's go jump uh jump
47:29
back a little bit when you pass away now in this at this time if you passed away i've been
47:35
president when many people leave their physical body your spiritual body at the time you stop breathing and
47:41
that little line in the hospital goes beep it's the beginning of the rest of your life it isn't the end of your life your
47:48
body this body sleeps there is no soul sleeping people that be
47:54
like taking you and sticking you in the ground and burying you right now that doesn't happen your spirit and your soul
47:59
is always awake it never has to sleep your body has to take a nap every now
48:05
and then on the earth i i sleep for a couple hours so but but this physical body that will die when the dead in
48:12
christ shall rise that's your body because your spirit man with your soul
48:18
intact has been living in heaven he goes jesus said my father goes to
48:23
prepare a place for you that was jesus saying those words okay so that you can be with them when you
48:30
die you can be with them to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord there's the evidence i know there's
48:36
whole denominations that believe when you're dead you know nothing you're just sleeping
48:42
yeah i mean that's the way i was raised i absolutely believed it you know but yeah yeah you're so alive
48:49
you are more alive in heaven uh in heaven you exist to live
48:54
okay that's the way you can say it on earth you have to make a living in order to exist but in heaven you exist to live
49:02
the greatest life you ever had and there's so many things to do in heaven because we all have gifts all those
49:09
amazing gifts are created in heaven uh places for them to happen and when you
49:14
get home to heaven when this spiritual body who who that still you when it
49:21
steps out of the physical body you will be young there'll be no handicaps if you're blind you won't be blind you're
49:27
sick you won't be sick if you're missing limbs you won't have any limbs missing you'll be able to touch yourself you're
49:32
you'll be get you're probably glowing most most christians have a light you see the light that's in them your spiritual body still looks like you but
49:39
like about in the 20s maybe 25 years old like that you look young
49:44
if your 100 year old grandma died don't call her back she's not for sure can't when you go
49:51
and when you pass away and you're now you've got this you're you're free from all this junk and your
49:57
bodies did do you do you suddenly remember your time with the father i've never asked you this question before do
50:04
you remember you were there before have you ever seen anything about that i think i actually i actually remember
50:10
that on the earth i can remember myself sitting in the hand of god
50:15
just a little little little spirit uh and uh him telling me about things that
50:21
i would get to do on the earth for him oh wow and then then that memories kind of taken from you you have to make your
50:28
own decision if you choose him or not use him but i can tell you with jesus christ pursuing all of us holy spirit
50:36
coming alongside of us we all have guardian angels every person usually has
50:41
two and when god knits us together this is how it happens i don't even talk about that when he's ready to send you
50:49
from heaven to earth he'll take your little spiritual being and hold it in his hand
50:55
and the last thing he says is i love you wow i want you to know me then the holy
51:00
spirit will take that little spirit spiritual being and he goes in the womb
51:05
of the mother at that time of conception and he knits and attaches that little
51:12
spirit of life which is you that you're spearman he attaches it to that dot of flesh it says i knit you together in
51:19
your mother's womb that doesn't mean you put your arms and legs on that means you somehow you i knit you
51:26
together he knit you to that dot of flow and your spirit man will adapt to that
51:32
flesh so as your body grows your spirit man gets a face it gets a permanent
51:39
image and the angels are sent at the time the father sends you from himself
51:45
your guardian angels go with you and they're outside the mother waiting for you to be born
51:52
and that's how the birthing happens so let's go forward when you pass when it's time when it's time to go into
51:58
heaven or just something happens and your spirit man male or female when it
52:04
steps out of that body you're flooded with the life of god the joy of the lord you will see your
52:09
guardian angels for the first time waiting to take you there is no fear
52:15
i know they say there's fear and death maybe on the way to diane but the second you die and step out of this body you
52:22
belong to god there is no fear anywhere excitement flood your soul joy flood
52:27
your soul you love the people if they're present in the room they'll even wave goodbye to them you probably never get to see that
52:33
some people get to see it and then there's a transport sent for you it could be any kind of a transport some
52:40
look like starships some are chariots if jesus comes he's got his own chariot of
52:45
fire and he'll take you on up to heaven you go through the whole cosmos by the way they do not use the word universe in
52:52
heaven oh really all the stars and all the skies that god made the word cosmos
52:57
means by divine design the word universe means the big bang is
53:02
here and there's no and there's no one way that he takes you like he said a transport jesus could show up
53:10
angels could you know it's always i've seen even um you know people think well
53:15
they'd be afraid especially young boys they come in and pick them up in a spiritual biplane like
53:22
an old biplane that's funny and they get a helmet put on them by their angels and
53:28
they shoot off up to heaven i've seen things that come down that look like this glorious elevator it comes straight
53:34
down it's made out of light and when it opens sometimes he lets some of your family members come with him and and
53:42
they are saying come on and they they they jump and their spiritual body they'll jump in the elevator and the
53:48
doors close and off they go to heaven so i think it's whatever would delight each individual person and then once you get
53:55
into heaven you get out there's a there's a deep disembark disembark a place where you disembark you see the river of life
54:02
right there you see the welcome center off in the distance for the people who are in kind of shock like why is there
54:08
music why are people dancing why am i seeing my pet why are these things flying there's the
54:15
dinosaur just flew by what is this people riding on light uh they're laughing uncontrollably in heaven
54:21
thinking it would be boring and so they get escorted by the heritage family to
54:26
the welcome center but usually jesus many times doesn't
54:32
wait for you to come into the throne when he meets you he'll get you in the river of life you step in the river of
54:37
life it floods you he begins to throw the water on you then you have a water fight this is reality really and you're
54:44
laughing and laughing laughing so hard all your family are running through the gates because you can see the gates a
54:50
little bit away so this is just so you can experience part of heaven uh before you ever get to the gate and so uh
54:57
usually the pets outrun the family members they'll usually be there first and they'll step out of the river and
55:02
everybody's just hugging and hugging and and uh you know kissing each other they're so excited and they said we're
55:09
so happy that you're here and then they all go into they begin to walk into the throne room that's an experience when
55:14
the doors are thrown open wide you've never seen crown molding the crown molding all
55:22
along this big mess of hallway you see a light coming from the throne which is high and lifted up in the center of the
55:29
throne room it's not on the back wall everyone goes all the way around the throne and they're singing they're
55:35
dancing they're celebrating because someone new has come home to heaven and jesus walks you up the steps that's such
55:41
a simple statement because the throne is high and lifted up and in the river of life's flowing down
55:47
these steps and there's gifts all up and down these steps and people are just worshiping and celebrating all over the
55:54
living creatures are standing on the four sides of the throne at the at the bottom of those steps of the
55:59
living creatures and and they're massive eyes all in their body they walk upright
56:04
they have golden hooves for feet their wings are embellished with so many eyes they don't have eyelashes they look like
56:11
the colors of a peacock and and their heads they're huge they have eyes everywhere and so there's four sets of
56:18
steps going up the throne in the middle of the throne room you're trying to take all this in here's the the glory cloud
56:25
over you can't even see the ceiling the place is so massive the seraphim dipped down out of the glory cloud their hair
56:31
is on fire it's like blue fire uh just declaring things over god and over his
56:36
son on the throne this is what everyone experiences you feel like you're gonna melt
56:43
in your mouth when you see jesus for the first time you look in his eyes and you're like he always loved me he died
56:51
just for me and the reality of it really just hit you for the first time in your life i'm so
56:58
glad people didn't give up on me that people kept praying for me to know christ don't ever stop praying for your
57:03
family members to know christ don't ever stop doing that and then you're you're experiencing this so there's like steps
57:10
and then there's columns and then there's more steps than columns it's actually a structure it's a massive structure
57:17
that is in the shape of guess what but what a pyramid or a
57:24
yeah but it's actually that's where that's where they got that idea from by the way oh okay then stole satan stole
57:32
images of god okay copycat them the first original thing that was built like
57:38
this was the structure of the throne of god it is so high underneath there are
57:43
rooms where people would go to intercede it talks about that they say the souls are under the altar
57:50
and people are like how can you get under no no the altar is way up in front of the throne of god all of
57:57
this on the inside of the throne structure people can go in there and pray and declare
58:02
and so this your experience you're having this is your first experience with heaven millions of angels are all over in the
58:09
sky outside the rainbow shoots out of the throne room and goes all over heaven
58:14
to look for somebody and grab them and bring them back because god wants to visit with them all of this the flowers
58:20
are singing they're alive they have life in them the river of life actually can
58:25
come up and it has a face on it it begins to worship god this is in the throne room
58:31
the river has a face the river has a face it has a light yes did you say did
58:37
you say a face though and make sure did you say it i said a face and where the river of life the river of life flows
58:44
out of the throne of god down the streets of gold the river that's in the streets of gold is the river of life
58:50
that came from the father and then it goes all over heaven it creates uh streams it creates the the
58:58
crystal sea um there's iowans on the crystal sea you can have a mansion on if god gave you
59:04
one there uh the the crystal sea has a life and there's times where it
59:09
will come up part of it in the crystal sea if you're standing on the banks and it will begin to worship god and
59:15
everybody along the banks of the crystal sea is so massive everyone begins to worship god and then
59:22
they break into celebration so it's between worship celebration in heaven is a form of worship because you're
59:29
celebrating what he gave you that's the way you're grateful for doing that so you're you're not even up to the father
59:35
yet right you feel like you're gonna know anything next to jesus christ the living god you know the son of the
59:41
living god you can see the the holes which are here by the way they're not here and he wouldn't be able to stay on
59:47
the cross or there's huge holes right here if you can put your finger through them uh but his eyes are sometimes
59:53
flames of fire uh sometimes they're like just i say liquid pools of love and all
59:59
you know is this i came from here and that's when the reality hit you steve the reality hits
1:00:06
you when you're going up into the steps into the throne you knew that you knew that you knew
1:00:11
you lived with him and when you finally he brings you up to the father and he says look father i have brought back to
1:00:18
you your son or your daughter whichever you are and then he says your name and and then you see uh the outline of the
1:00:26
father's face with all of this sound and frequencies and life and love
1:00:33
flowing out of him he reaches out and takes you in his arms and holds you to himself and you think
1:00:40
i'm never leaving him i'm never ever ever going to live
1:00:47
without being in his presence i belong to him i remember living in him
1:00:54
you knew that was your home he was your home in him you live you move you have a
1:00:59
very existence you know at that moment steve you came from him and him alone
1:01:04
that he is your actual father no matter who your father was on the earth or how you were treated you know
1:01:10
on the earth of course satan is still present evil is present if that's not ever been shown to you uh you've been
1:01:16
hiding somewhere but i will tell you this no power in the earth on the earth around the
1:01:23
earth is greater than the power of the living god his son jesus christ and the
1:01:29
holy spirit they have plans made for this time on the earth for greatness
1:01:36
we get to be great we get to manifest and demonstrate for the living of god what are we
1:01:41
demonstrating his power his words his plans we demonstrate them
1:01:47
we do as his sons and daughters that's why it's called manifested sons and daughters the earth is in travail not
1:01:54
because the end is here people is crying out for the sons and daughters to stand up and start being who they're supposed
1:02:01
to be so what is god doing clearing the deck and the platform crushing and
1:02:06
pushing back evil will not begin to arise for generations in the way it is
1:02:11
now what is happening now exposure people that no one on this earth can stop they are so full of their self and
1:02:19
the devil they think they're getting away with it they're given their own testimony of their evil that god clearly
1:02:26
sees and knows about and he is sending justice
1:02:31
so this experience when you finally get up to the father and jesus is standing there the whole time grinning from ear
1:02:39
to ear it says in the bible that jesus came that he might make a way back
1:02:44
to the father that's what i'm telling you what that's it this is that okay wow means this this
1:02:51
is what you experienced everybody your family people who are in your family line from 500 000 2000 years ago 3 000
1:03:00
years ago you'll meet people that were in your generational line somewhere and they're all celebrating that you have
1:03:06
come home to heaven and the father will turn you around when he's done hugging you and say look
1:03:13
my son and give his name or he'll say my daughter and give your name they have come home
1:03:19
oh wow and this is it sounds like so your generation's on your mother's side
1:03:24
and your dad's side so is this like a pre-planned family reunion all of your family
1:03:30
on both sides they already whenever whenever god already knows who was in what generation he already knows and by the
1:03:37
way they in heaven know they're part of your generational line before you ever get there so they know you're coming
1:03:42
home they know that somewhere down the line you were part of what they were doing on the earth for god uh you'll be
1:03:49
surprised and be amazed to find who you're actually related to on the earth but everyone be everybody
1:03:55
because jesus christ the bridegroom they call them their lord their king they
1:04:02
want to be with him and yes you may have loved each other on the earth but everyone and those who were husband and
1:04:09
wives will love jesus more than anything else in heaven really not good you're not going to miss the way you lived your
1:04:14
life on the earth this is a such a higher uh life experience in heaven your
1:04:21
your soul the some of the emotions finally come alive or you get to begin to express them but at the throne the
1:04:28
father will start giving you gifts then really rewards he'll give rewards at the throne and then you'll get more actually
1:04:35
for some time if there was time in heaven but he starts giving him and i love to tell use a whitney houston as an
1:04:42
as an example because i was sitting on a pla sitting on a a road waiting to speak
1:04:48
and the holy spirit said whitney houston has gone home to heaven and so when i got up i actually shared
1:04:54
everything i saw and i i saw her before the throne she she was joy joy and
1:05:00
speakable was coming over her if you don't know what happened to whitney the night before she passed
1:05:07
uh she was in great depression at that time she was going through a lot of things and people she went somewhere um
1:05:13
i think it was to some lounge or something and everybody was demanding that she sing they wanted to hear her
1:05:18
sing and she kept saying i don't want to i don't feel like it and finally she said i will sing one thing
1:05:24
and she get this is actual truth everybody knows well people who know know it that she got up and started singing um
1:05:32
i'm trying to remember what she's saying jesus said jesus loves me is it messed with me she's being the same
1:05:38
everything in her soul because she was at a point of brokenness and just really
1:05:43
open to god she began to sing people said it was the most anointed thing they ever heard but something else was
1:05:49
happening she was getting born again she's saying with all everything within
1:05:55
her she was inviting jesus she was saying how much you know yes she just loves me
1:06:00
saying that whole song by the end of the song she was born again and he went home and passed
1:06:06
and and that's why the holy spirit said whitney houston has passed to heaven no
1:06:11
she's passed away she's gone to heaven and at that moment sitting on the front row i was caught up to heaven at that
1:06:16
moment saw her before the throne and the father said i'm so glad you've come home
1:06:22
my daughter and he said here's a gift i have saved just for you and it takes out this little chest the most beautiful if
1:06:28
the chest was alive the embellishments were alive on the chest he opens it and out of it comes a song
1:06:36
and the father said only i have sung this song whitney i saved it for you and the song was like a red it was like a a
1:06:43
garnet color it look it came out like it was alive it was a garment and it wove itself around her like this
1:06:50
beautiful robe and when she stood there she'd move her hand you'd hear the father singing off of her
1:06:57
oh man
1:07:09
you can hear me sing but you will now sing the song for me all over heaven she was so undone she was so beautiful so
1:07:18
filled with life and everybody was just just so excited in in the throne room they were celebrating they were
1:07:24
congratulating her they were so they were blessing the father for giving her that for that gift and he said this is
1:07:30
because you are willing to be the gift i sent you and no matter what you went
1:07:35
through you never stopped using that gift so i have given you my own song
1:07:41
just singing and is that this is that um there is a
1:07:46
thing that says that he sings a song that nobody else knows or he gives you a name that
1:07:51
you know i'm trying to remember the scripture but there's kind of a scripture that relates to that i yeah he
1:07:57
he used to sing over by the way when this is god this is the father he's so amazing
1:08:02
he can be as big and high as high up as he wants so to soak in christ christ can be as tall as he wants to something holy
1:08:09
spirit i mean if if the father if the father when when he spoke and the word
1:08:14
began to make the earth and then he hands it to the father now when the earth is done he hands it to
1:08:20
the father and he reaches inside of himself and takes one handful of water
1:08:26
from himself he's standing out nothing pours it on the earth it becomes the ocean on the earth
1:08:32
and remember the water maple shield then he takes another handful and pours it over the earth so it's like a bubble
1:08:39
and then he takes a second one and pours it over that's why i know there's twice as much water in the water vapor shield that flooded the earth so anyway
1:08:46
revelation is the greatest thing ever he calls me a revelator this you know you reveal something for god so this is
1:08:54
whitney's homegoing experience and and once you when you've been in the throne room people will want to greet you when
1:09:00
the father finally lets you go and he'll tell you all these things he he has for you and how much he loves you and
1:09:06
appreciated and so glad that you received his son and then he'll hand him eventually back to jesus who's been
1:09:12
standing there all this time and he walks you back down to the steps and everyone starts celebrating in the
1:09:18
throne room you have a throne room party and finally your family will say let's
1:09:23
go see your mansion you got to see your mansion they've been watching it being built they'll take you to your mansion
1:09:29
and then there's more gifts where those gifts come from when your family members go home every year that passes at your
1:09:36
part they get a gift and put it in your throne in your in your mansion so you have a gift for every year you were
1:09:42
apart from your family members waiting for your vision to be open and are these gifts
1:09:48
clothes garments they could be anything they could be anything because there's so many things
1:09:54
in heaven remember people who make these things are there this is made out of wood gemstones uh beautiful things to
1:10:02
wear beautiful things to now your mansion is built not by man's hands they're built by god but a lot of people
1:10:08
will buy things you like and put them in your mansion you know to embellish your mansion but these are gifts things that
1:10:14
you love maybe something made out of crystal or just really beautiful pottery because people who are potters died what
1:10:20
they have and they make beautiful things so they go all over heaven is it that they know well you know well
1:10:26
steve when he was on the earth he used to like whatever and and they remember that so
1:10:31
they get that kind of a gift okay and if you love flowers you will have five foot
1:10:37
arrangements that will sing to you when you come home with your mansion wow
1:10:42
i have a question you know you said heaven itself is bigger than our galaxy
1:10:47
which is of course billions or trillions of light years and all that but um the
1:10:52
earth is very finite if if god makes a new heavens and new earth and he comes down to live on earth does the earth
1:11:00
become then this massive yes it's not the same size
1:11:05
i don't know why people they they don't like to hear that the earth will be just taken away but it actually
1:11:12
says it will i like it frankly i'd like it to melt with fervent heat as it says because i
1:11:18
don't want any part of you know the darkness none it's gonna be okay it's gonna be okay you will so love
1:11:25
the new earth the new earth will be millions of times bigger millions wow
1:11:31
than this one we're on now you think about the city the city of god that's in heaven
1:11:38
if you sat that city on the earth now the earth would go whoop they couldn't hold it it's so huge you
1:11:45
can read in the bible and see how big it says it is uh with all the beautiful layers of gemstones that will come down
1:11:53
on the earth and the father will get on that he's going to put all of us on the new earth when it's done so we get to
1:11:59
see it first then he will come down to live with us forever i want to ask you a question because
1:12:05
this meant a lot to me when i heard you say it one time i said did you really say what i thought you said because i
1:12:11
think if it blesses me it must it will bless other people did you say in your mansion god will have preserved
1:12:18
some of your favorite family photos and it would be is that is that what you said is that how you
1:12:23
said it he doesn't have to preserve them he makes he makes his own
1:12:29
he makes his own like he can take a picture of everything if it doesn't take a picture he recreates the same photos
1:12:36
and they're framed in your mansion i've been in people's mansions and i saw family members who had not been born yet
1:12:43
i saw there really yes yes that's amazing so he's already got the
1:12:50
family portraits or the he's already got them there yes and you do live right next to each other although some
1:12:56
people's property is so massive i love to tell the story about when the
1:13:01
father showed me when he met when he said big when he what he says is wealthy is not
1:13:08
what our wealthy is you don't understand wealth because you haven't seen heaven heaven's not poor
1:13:16
why would it be poor when the bible says jesus became poor that we might be rich
1:13:22
he was poor compared to heaven sanders when he left heaven and came to the earth that was it
1:13:27
that's why he had to bring wealth to him he yeah you know the caravan that didn't bring one little flask of something one
1:13:34
little thing of gold it was a caravan they had camels carrying great wealth
1:13:40
they would probably take care of jesus the entire time he was on the earth he had the best scholars in egypt they fled
1:13:46
to egypt he was in egypt for some not for a long time for for years i'm sure several years at least and and that's
1:13:53
where they live for a while so that herod couldn't find him so that he couldn't be killed that's how he preserved him but jesus actually was
1:14:01
wealthy by earth standards he had garments that had no seams in them they
1:14:07
actually wanted the garments he was wearing when he went to the cross he had wealthy friends why because wealthy is
1:14:14
drawn to wealth wealth is drawn to wealthy where wealth is people are going to follow after that
1:14:19
and then they got to know him then i'm sure they that he became their savior at one point but he was invited to all the
1:14:25
weddings not just one wedding that was quite a big wedding he was at where he turned the water into heaven's wine
1:14:31
uh by the way he did that at home all the time that's why miriam knew he could do it that's it he was doing the miracle
1:14:37
because it wasn't at home okay you know we had always always raised to believe that jesus was the poor among the poor
1:14:43
of the galileans but you know he started off his life with gold frankincense and
1:14:48
myrrh his father his father was a master carpenter right so there was a very wealthy person in the city wow and he
1:14:55
knew that he knew the leaders of the city joseph knew the leaders of the city
1:15:00
because you get there's a key given to you if you're one of the wealthy people you have you get a key sword like they
1:15:06
say gates to the city thing uh the only reason well not because god planned it
1:15:11
that way the reason why they didn't stone joseph was because they weren't willing to lose their master carpenter people
1:15:19
i'm serious about that this is what the father said is that when i gave someone to raise my son
1:15:24
in the same gift jesus has a gift he still makes things
1:15:30
in heaven he's a master carpenter he makes things in heaven because he likes to joseph he had to have someone that
1:15:36
could raise jesus up to be a master at what he sent him with that natural gift joseph was a
1:15:42
master carpenter and he was wealthy and so he was they weren't willing so the
1:15:48
city fathers actually got together and said what are we going to do about all this and so they told joseph put her away until after she has the child
1:15:55
everything like that and uh and then of course they were married and then they had other kids and people say yes mary
1:16:02
did mary had other jesus had siblings you had to suffer in every way like us
1:16:07
yeah before he had you have siblings what is the what is the thing about
1:16:13
because we've seen photos of him that akiana did where he's handsome yet there's a scripture about he did not
1:16:19
have the form that we would desire him i can't remember the exact so was he a handsome
1:16:25
man or was he he was sort of like a rugged type so he wasn't like what you would call there's guys i call like you
1:16:32
know a pretty boy i could name after his names but i don't want to do that they're still who are so
1:16:37
strikingly handsome right so they were trying what he was trying to portray was he wasn't
1:16:43
he didn't want people to be drawn to jesus because he was so handsome right but he was definitely a man's man
1:16:51
he was rugged he was strong he lifted trees to make the the stuff that he
1:16:57
worked with so his hands were very probably callous they were rugged uh i i
1:17:02
saw him he he's very rugged even today but it's the love that comes from him
1:17:08
that captivates your heart so he's not he isn't not he's not ugly obviously at
1:17:15
all but i would say definitely is a real handsome um god put him together pretty well yeah
1:17:21
and did then can he ask you about his sense of humor on the earth now i know because i've heard testimonies of people
1:17:26
with psalm in heaven he's hilariously funny was he funny on the earth did the
1:17:32
yes oh let me tell you what you shouldn't i know i'm not telling
1:17:38
anybody to go out and bash the evil and the wicked but i will remind you that jesus christ had a lot of his own
1:17:45
personal one-liners to give to the religious hierarchy
1:17:50
you were waiting sepulchers that means you were a gravestone filled with dead man's bones that was his own opinion of
1:17:57
what he thought about the people who were taking people's money using it wrongly demanding their sacrifice wasn't
1:18:04
worth anything and making them go pay more money that they probably got a part of that too and so jesus wasn't happy
1:18:10
with the religious harkey what do you think he tore up the whole what he tore up in the courtyard was the
1:18:15
money changers selling the goods that those hierarchy would get part of
1:18:21
and they were cheating the people like to sell to buy a dove for for their sacrifice so their sins could be
1:18:28
forgiven once a year they had to pay money for that jesus had had it
1:18:33
so jesus definitely was a a character with a capital c he also knew how to make people laugh he
1:18:40
made people laugh a lot but anyone who was around when he said those words they always wanted to say those words i'm
1:18:46
quite sure everybody you've heard him say your white deceptice full of dead men's bones you're going to say that about them but they'd be strung out
1:18:52
somewhere well you know that that series the chosen which i think is very very anointed now it's just an earthly
1:18:59
um creation of a production but it's very anointed where they portray
1:19:04
christ but i loved what they did is when he would work some miracles like the fish when he missed peter one of those
1:19:11
first he was laughing and he was smiling at what he had done i mean i'm wondering if
1:19:17
he was like that did he love what he did he laughed he laughed a lot i tell you you couldn't get um you couldn't get
1:19:23
that many men to follow you no matter what if you weren't funny if you didn't have revelation beyond their
1:19:29
understanding but the reason why he was funny was if all you got was the awe
1:19:35
he'd be so immobilized you couldn't even move or think because of the power of the presence and the glory he carried
1:19:43
humor will will not temper that but it balances the holy spirit the word is balanced yeah i had to live a balanced
1:19:50
life he was hilariously funny but i tell you what and he was fierce against evil he didn't power any demon but he also
1:19:57
had such sound wisdom and revelation he would get people like
1:20:02
what child is going to keep uh you know captive when he was left behind
1:20:08
at the temple and he missing for someone right yeah several days he was in the
1:20:13
presence of those priests giving them revelation they had no way how does he even know
1:20:19
this he he was captain that wasn't that was what he wasn't being funny then he was manifesting revelation that comes
1:20:26
from the father that gets you completely undone for the first time you understand something when you get revelation so
1:20:32
that's what he was giving them was revelation he didn't even stop to eat he was with them and here's mary
1:20:38
thinking oh my gosh what is he eating how's he sleeping and they show up and there he is
1:20:44
i have to be about the father's business i mean yeah
1:20:50
he was he had friends he sat with sinners because these were business
1:20:55
contacts this was a master carpenter they wanted their home built by the best carpenter
1:21:02
but they also got the other stuff from him also i mean he shared all he could every time he had a chance so these
1:21:09
meetings he would have a business people they would invite their friends to come and hear what he had to say and i know
1:21:14
what that's like everywhere you go it's a meeting if you've got revelation and you know god wherever you go in the
1:21:20
store in the marketplace at a business thing you're going to have an audience we i have audiences form at the checkout
1:21:27
counter at the grocery store because they want to hear about revelation jesus i understand when they said he had no
1:21:34
time to eat or sleep because people were pulling they want this something never heard
1:21:39
before that gives you life that gives you hope that shows you the power in the living god and jesus shared it
1:21:45
everywhere uh but one thing he never tolerated he never tolerated evil he didn't
1:21:50
participate with it he didn't tolerate it at all and i and i you know in contrast not in
1:21:57
contrast to that but along those lines the woman at the wells one of my favorite stories because she was full of
1:22:04
sin he knew it yeah but he didn't condemn her he didn't allow it either
1:22:09
but you know he must have had a gas of a time just saying you know if you kind of if
1:22:15
you knew who i'm talking to who you were talking to you'd say give me a drink of water i mean it was probably a little
1:22:20
more fun than we portray it you know he's always got i'm sure but i can tell you like i said he was a character
1:22:27
almost everything he delivered it he his lines were they're probably forever put in eternity
1:22:34
and you can go to a place in heaven and actually revisit i mean you're watching it but you can
1:22:40
actually see him when he talks i would love that i would love that i'm talking to the woman at the well and you
1:22:46
experience all the same thing the woman did the words he gave her nobody could have known that stuff who knew that
1:22:53
she didn't know him how could he know that she was so captivated and she ran and said he told me everything i ever
1:23:00
did and so but i'm sure he did it with quite uh it was quite joyful to him he did
1:23:07
enjoy doing this and i love that i love that one and we better get going here but i love that part because the
1:23:13
scripture records that well it's not you i know you're not your hus you know but you've had five husbands the one you're
1:23:19
with and not your husband but when she goes into the city and says he told me everything i
1:23:26
ever did there must have been quite some conversations going on it was quite conversation and i am quite sure that he
1:23:33
gave names well wouldn't that be cool yeah what about that time with george
1:23:38
you know wrote in the same remember that now look this is a thing the man was
1:23:44
never accused of anything but that woman was accused and they all wanted to stone her so
1:23:50
jesus this is what you're talking about the humor part when he squat down and began to write in the same he was making a list
1:23:58
he wrote the name of a person with a stone and the sin they did the name of another one and the sin they
1:24:04
did and he kept gone going and before all this group with their stones gonna stone this wicked person
1:24:11
here was all the sins they did with their name jesus was making a less
1:24:16
people oh good yeah it's so good enjoying it he probably was grinning oh
1:24:22
yeah he's doing it i bet it you know it was so fun you know wow well kat this is so so good thank
1:24:28
you so much this is a real shot in the arm of really happy stuff because god is so good i mean there's just it's just
1:24:36
it's just like the whole time you've told the story you've just basically said the goodness of god the goodness of
1:24:42

1:29:39
for so accurately representing the lord the father son of the holy spirit that's so good you know i've heard some of
1:29:46
these things before not every one of them but i can't hear it enough times because they just kind of re-energizes
1:29:52
me i know it's doing that to the people too so energized go get some chocolate cake what what'd you say i want to say
1:29:58
one more thing i want to assure you that none of your family members died alone
1:30:04
if there was nobody there if something happened they're never alone those are angels are with them from the time that they were
1:30:10
conceived the the minute they leave this body they will be with them they will be
1:30:15
escorted in some glorious way all the way up into into heaven which is
1:30:21
such a beautiful amazing place there's life and love everywhere everything is alive in heaven there's so many things
1:30:28
that they can enjoy and do and their mansion will just rock them when they see it i i didn't get to finish holy spirit
1:30:34
said i saw the mansion of an intercessor that was bigger than new york city oh my
1:30:41
goodness that's how that's what kind of premium god puts on it praying
1:30:47
intercessors wow that was an intercessor so but you loving people every time you did an act
1:30:53
of kindness he remembers every single act of kindness and when you get your robe of righteousness he puts a gemstone
1:31:00
representing every time you were kind for somebody that you love somebody
1:31:05
you're just going to be undone he's he's got such many many things to give you
1:31:11
and show you but of course being there and living that for all of
1:31:16
eternity even when there's no time eternity will still keep going and there'll be places
1:31:22
created that we can go and visit from the new earth uh and you'll never sin you can never your body will be
1:31:29

1:35
well hello and happy wednesday april 13 2022 welcome to the broadcast it's
1:41
catcur day so we're going to have a a really good time with kat here in just a moment i don't have a lot of
1:46
announcements i just have one well i've got two announcements first of all i'm going to run
1:52
let me just let's just get ready to run the word by amanda amanda at the reawakening
1:57
uh amer uh reawakening of america uh am i saying that right
2:03
reawakening america uh conference we had a couple weeks ago now amanda grace gave
2:09
a great word for the state of oregon since i'm in oregon uh i'm going to play that and we will we
2:15
may even play it again tomorrow when when amanda is on but it's an amazing word and it shows how god will deal with the
2:22
governor you know like new the lieutenant governor just got arrested in new york yesterday so god is dealing with
2:28
governors so um here's without further ado let's let's play this word by amanda that she
2:35
gave publicly in in oregon just like two weeks ago so here we go
2:41
speaking of the heinous people that want to feed perversions and sexual immorality to our children
2:48
the lord says it's better to have a millstone hung around your neck and be cast into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to sin
2:56
the lord thy god is wrapping some millstones around their necks this year you better repent
3:04
you need to repent before the lord
3:10
for the people of oregon there is a very oppressive territorial spirit that has attempted to control and
3:17
dominate large influential areas of your state through certain groups yes there is more
3:24
than one at work the lord thy god as you pray and seek boldly as deliverance is going to cut
3:29
the main vein of operations that leads to the higher offices and the state that feeds it
3:37
praise the lord and since the governor has been paid off to let them pillage plunder and harass
3:43
thus says the lord god your platform and podium shall be kicked out from under you and you shall slip out of office in
3:50
shame for what you have done to these people [Applause]
3:56
god has not forgotten you people of oregon he has not forgotten you
4:05
god is your deliverer not the governor and the governor is going to answer
4:11
before god not the other way around so good that was just so good i did i
4:19
wasn't in the room at the time so i had missed that word but my staff said that you know that the crowd went wild it was
4:26
really uh an amazing reaction so uh we may play that again uh tell your friends
4:31
uh we'll play it again tomorrow when amanda's on the show so she is uh the
4:36
more the longer i watch amanda and listen to her prophetic words the more respect and regard i have for her
4:43
because she is so accurate so when she says he's going to slip out of our office in shame
4:51
that means it's really going to happen like that so yes god all right one other announcement before
4:56
we bring kat on as you know we produce uh american warriors it's a it's a it's a program
5:03
about the greatest sacrifice of all those that lay down their life for for their countrymen
5:09
our first responders are military men basically and it's produced by myself and my
5:15
brother warren anyway we want you to be aware of that program so is at the very end of this
5:21
program we're going to go ahead and run an episode uh right here on this channel you don't
5:27
even have to go there you just watch it right here so as we sign up with gat i'll say uh uh you know i'll say now it's time to
5:33
run american words and they'll run that so i just want you hopefully you'll many of you will stay and watch that and
5:39
enjoy it um and then you the the channel that it's on you go to elijah streams
5:44
and one of the channels on the channel tab is aw for american warriors and so i
5:49
hope you'll avail yourself to that um program more and more so
5:55
all right let's bring in cat kerr here good morning
6:01
i guess it's morning this morning for me it is morning for you it's afternoon in jacksonville
6:08
florida but it's actually your your morning right so yeah i get up at noon
6:13
so anytime between noon and like three that's my morning when i first wake up and so for anyone that wonders why she
6:20
sleeps till noon what time do you tend to go to bed around seven or eight in the morning [Laughter]
6:26
so it's not like you're having a long night of sleep so no no i sleep about
6:31
four hours and i'm up for 20. i don't think i could do that unless the lord gave me the grace to do it but wow
6:38
he made me that way he sent me like i was that way even as a little child wow yes
6:44
well so uh we're going to get into the questions which i'll introduce in in a few moments but is there anything you
6:51
want to talk about current events at all before we get into the questions for today um i never do but will because
6:58
i've guys already almost said the same exact words uh through me and not just me and not just amanda but that is going
7:05
to happen and it's going to increase about those slipping out in shame
7:11
i remember when the father told me that several great leaders i won't mention their names right now
7:17
they would slip away in the night because they'd be so ashamed realizing that the failure they have done
7:22
and how many people would hate them and come after them if they didn't escape i think slip away in shame is one way of
7:28
saying it the father said to me they will escape so they don't die the same words he's also said to me
7:36
several times and i've talked about it in several places about the millstone because of the children
7:41
he is adamant about the ones that he sends to this earth he times your birth on the earth you're not not here by
7:47
mistake no matter where how you were born who your parents were your natural parents your heavenly parent is the
7:54
father he times everything so he wants you here for a specific reason when
7:59
people take the lives away of those that he is sent here for a reason he is not happy at all and there will be some that
8:06
don't survive this that they they will outright die and i don't know how they'll die because they've been
8:11
involved in so much of the slaughter of the unborn uh but not just the unborn even the the little ones who've been in
8:18
the human trafficking thing there's such severe justice coming and there's no way people can even pray
8:25
to prevent that justice from coming the father even said do not pray against the justices
8:30
really really yeah he said my time frame that i've given them to repent and stop
8:36
what they're doing and come forward and tell the truth is just about gone and so they will the justice will be
8:42
severe the way they live was severe the lives they took the way they took it was severe therefore the justice they get
8:48
will be severe and i'm not surprised about lieutenant governor in new york being arrested either you're going to see a lot of
8:54
arrests coming forth there's going to be a lot of arrest like amanda said the podium he says she
9:00
said the podium will be taken away god said their voice will become like dust which means they will have no place to
9:05
speak i mean there'll be a time when nobody will want to hear from any of the wicked evil who've been controlling us
9:13
and the thing about cutting the vein for those who feed or supply all the wicked
9:18
god has actually had me saying that also that he's about to stop and cut the chain that's feeding or making provision
9:25
for all the others to do the wicked acts to build the wicked places and he's about to that's what he's going to do
9:31
literally he's going to go in many different places at different times they begin to sever off their supply they
9:38
want to stop our supply but he's about to stop their supply that means from the highest in the land the villain sitting
9:45
in the white house all the way down to the smallest person who's committing fraud and crime like never before like
9:52
he said on november the 4th the landslide of fraud exposure is going to
9:57
continue and increase to great to great heights uh who will be exposed what they
10:03
did and then what justice they will get so if you think nothing's happening you don't really know who god is or how he
10:10
operates and i know what we live in the natural world but the one who holds the air we breathe
10:15
is really over everything although we've been given this earth to rule from ourselves as kings and lords and priests
10:22
he is about to intervene and it's going to be something nobody can stop no matter who they are what the position is
10:29
how much money they have by the way they're going to lose all that money he's going to leave a penniless with no
10:35
place to go nothing to stand for no voice to give so in other words they won't be wanted they
10:42
may by being hunted by people because of how wicked they've been well now you
10:47
know people might look at the one in new york and said well they got the lieutenant governor but the one atop the
10:53
governor is is safe that's not the way these things work the way it works
11:00
the first act of the governor who took the place of cuomo her very first act was to appoint this lieutenant governor
11:07
that's right you know and to use an expression again he knows where the bodies are buried they usually they'll
11:12
take the lower level and they'll and they'll squeeze them for for truth about the higher level so i'm
11:19
guessing the governor of new york is pre is sweating it out pretty much so you know and by the way i'll let me just say
11:26
this i know that you talk about some may not survive and i know you very well you're not advocating violence in any
11:32
way no i'm not but god will have his way yes he will you know and so if someone
11:40
just suddenly doesn't survive they're here one minute and all of a sudden they drop that's not that's not
11:46
mankind doing that's not man doing that so it's god justice and if you're crying
11:52
out for justice just how do you think he's gonna do it he is the guy who knows everything
11:57
everywhere all at the same time no one has escaped his viewing of what they're
12:02
doing he knows who's doing what he knows names address he knows the air they breathe he knows everything about them
12:09
and because it is seed time and harvest not for the great harvest people trust
12:14
me you're not ready it wouldn't be the great harvest what would you do with a billion people getting saved you wouldn't know what to do so this is seed
12:21
time and harvest for all this being seeded against us for all these months
12:26
we've been going through and also those who've been doing the blessings helping bringing hope speaking god's true word
12:33
they can't escape the blessings because it's harvest time but those who are wicked and evil there's no way you can
12:38
talk god out of not bringing that kind of justice because it is in his hand
12:44
justice is written on his throne and no one's going to take that away from him it's okay
12:50
well ken about uh almost two years ago a year and a half two years ago before this whole election thing was was a
12:57
thing uh that people were talking about you and you came to our home
13:02
here just outside of salem and we worked for we sat there at the dining room table for hours but during that time
13:10
we wrote down or i wrote down with your help the most common questions that
13:15
people ask about heaven and now we've added uh right then at that time we had
13:22
thousands of followers right now the number of people that watch us in a 90-day period are 1.2 million different
13:30
people so we're going to go back over those questions about heaven um
13:36
because a lot of people miss it so you've heard all we keep asking these other
13:41
for lack of a better word offbeat questions about this or that and some people say well tell me more of the guts
13:47
about heaven well we weren't doing that because we had covered it but it's time to cover it again so if you've missed it
13:54
this is the show tell your friends we're going to talk about heaven as if you've never heard cat ever talk on the subject
14:00
and this is the guts of it so if you're ready i'm ready to throw some questions at you
14:07
yeah i think i like um the father calls it uh the operations of
14:13
heaven heaven's operations um i guess the guts could be another way
14:21
inside scoop people everything happens which is what we need to know to give us hope and even join
14:28
excitement about what that place is so good awesome okay yeah no guts no
14:34
glory all right well let's have some fun by
14:40
the way you told me to wear a fun tie last time so i have my rubber montage look at that
14:45
i got my rubber ducky tie i was going to put on i had a donald duck one i thought it was as sure
14:51
as i put this thing on people are going to say you're criticizing uh you're you're promoting disney and
14:56
disney's in a bad place right now so but hey about that real quick before we get into this first question
15:04
you have seen walt disney in heaven right i absolutely have seen walt disney in
15:10
heaven nobody can take that away from him what god gave him and god did give him that idea for disney world
15:17
and even the way it happened it had to absolutely be god the way he got the land the property how all that was
15:23
designed uh walt loved families he loved families he loved his own he was very much
15:29
involved in their lives and he wanted a place where people could come that it would be safe it would be clean that
15:35
there would be no evil there and the children would be safe that was his whole plan let me tell you in heaven
15:41
right now he's not real happy let's just say his comment he's not happy with what's going on he wants it exposed but
15:47
he wants everyone to know that place was designed for families to enjoy their self and his own declaration is that it
15:55
will return the way it was designed to be and and and people could still be happy
16:00
there again it's a place this would be full of i guess even represent part of heaven and people would always
16:06
say i know what people's heads think well there's witchcraft going on there well you know in all his movies his
16:12
original movies disney by the way uh actually had left a statement behind
16:17
saying they couldn't change any of his original movies which they actually did just find that file
16:22
uh i know the plans of the liberals trying to operate disney were literally going to make changes as they took the
16:30
cartoon form of these movies he made and make them into people but they were going to put more um defilement in them
16:36
that really was their plan and not going to be able to get away with that now since that mysterious file has been
16:42
found that was in in disney's handwriting himself say he would not never allow or tolerate anyone taking
16:48
his original movies the way he designed them those movies always always showed
16:53
good against evil they never showed good witchcraft bad witchcraft they always showed that
16:59
witchcraft was evil and that it was overcome in the movie all evil was always overcome by good in all of his
17:05
movies uh there were plurals and heroines that stood for what was right
17:10
and they wanted even in those movies justice liberty and then freedom and that's the way he designed them so they
17:16
actually aren't going to go forward if you all are concerned about that they're not going to get to go forward with their plan which uh i think there was
17:24
something that was leaked out saying what the plan was going to be uh because you know our our governor here
17:30
yay desantis has held back some of the stuff that they've been getting away with and he's not going to tolerate a
17:36
lot of stuff that they wanted to do so they figured their way to pay back to get what they wanted this is truth they
17:42
were going to make all the remakes of those original movies more evil and promote people and defilement instead of
17:48
what walt always wanted to be so i can tell you walt probably was in on that somehow from heaven i don't know if he
17:55
sent angels to reveal where that file was uh but isn't found so now they've been stopped from doing that part of
18:01
their their plan for wickedness and uh and in case you ever know or find out there is undercover operations going on
18:08
there which i cannot speak about right now uh uh for exposure so
18:15
just know this if you ever find out i've gone somewhere that's not good it's because i'm doing
18:20
covert activity i'll just keep that heads up yeah you know and there's then uh to
18:26
expose things going on uh in these different places not just that but a lot of places are going to be exposed that
18:32
you never knew had stuff in it so just hang on it's a rocky uh
18:37
rocky road a rock could say why would roller coaster ride is the way the father puts it through this whole
18:44
plan of exposing bringing justice liberty but in the end it's going to be great freedom beautiful freedom and
18:50
liberty to move around actually have your family take them places have a future have not just hope but have a
18:56
great future for the next several hundred years there you go there you go that's good and that's another whole
19:03
subject all right first question on the list i'm just going to go right down now normally i'll just flow with it and
19:09
whatever question comes to me after you answered but we're going to go down this list to make sure we don't miss anything
19:15
so the first question is how many times cat have you gone to heaven and what's the difference between you going to
19:21
heaven and you've often said god just walked through the wall you've told me that
19:26
before what's the difference between those two kinds of um experiences or encounters
19:33
well i will first of all say it's never my choice when to go it's never my choice how to go i never
19:40
even asked to do this it is a commission in other words he came to me and gave me a commission telling me jesus christ did
19:47
in person what they were about to do to reveal heaven to this earth and he said we will come and take you whenever we
19:53
want to any way we want to uh we'll take you by your spirit and then when we're done we'll drop you back inside your
20:00
body and so i never know where it's going to happen or how it's going to happen uh the difference is the spirit
20:06
of god will just catch me up at any given moment no matter where i am he'll take my spirit person out of my body and
20:12
i'm there instantly in heaven other times if the father was really
20:17
adamant about different subjects of things going on he will walk through the wall of my home
20:23
and just start talking to me like i expected it to happen and i've been over a thousand times i
20:30
stopped counting after one thousand that was so many years ago i i ca i can't even explain this around
20:36
like 1989 or 88 when he first came to me and he gave me that whole commission and
20:43
he's never stopped taking me does just say that never stop taking me sometimes every day sometimes more than once a day
20:50
because he wants you to have all the revelation you need to know who you are who he is how heaven operates what's
20:56
going to go happen in the earth what happened in the past what's going to look like in the future any of those things he desires to choose is where he
21:03
takes me what he shows me or what he says to me so good so good all right
21:08
next question um how do you explain exodus 33 20 that says no man can see me
21:15
the father and live because people want to know why it's not possible for you to have seen the father because of that
21:21
scripture so how do you answer unless it's his desire if it's his desire and
21:26
you all do know that he caught john up in the book of revelation himself john himself who was the beloved who was the
21:33
closest disciple to jesus christ who was not ever murdered his life was not taken
21:38
he lived until he decided he wanted to go home to heaven there would be john the disciple
21:44
and he himself in the book of john said that very thing no man can see the face
21:50
of god and live and yet here we are books later he the one who said that was
21:55
caught up invited up by god himself the father sitting on the throne took him up
22:01
and showed him heaven john didn't have anything to do with it except he just went he saw a door open
22:08
in the heavens he was walking in the spirit and in the day that this happened in the lord's day and he heard a voice
22:13
saying come up he looked up and saw a door open and he went and so that was that was not without
22:18
dying that was that was without dying i'm sorry he didn't die to go and there's actually been many people even
22:25
in the bible we all know that paul saw heaven and couldn't talk about it it was so amazing
22:30
to him he didn't even know what to say so he wasn't allowed to talk about it but i literally have a face-to-face
22:36
commission to share everything i see everything i hear and then what god's plans are so here's john
22:43
i don't know what he said when he got back how did he explain that when he told people he can't see the face of god living yet he did yeah
22:49
father he saw it on the throne in revelations he talks about the rainbow coming in and out of him that's not
22:55
jesus okay that's the father that's life coming in and out of him and then he showed him things to come and then he
23:02
brought him back pretty much that's what he does to me he takes me up he shows me what he wants me to see in great detail
23:08
explains things and then he just brings me back and so i can only say what god decides is god's
23:16
will yeah and even though it may say something in his word normally you just in other words you can't just go up
23:22
there yourself and decide i'm gonna go up and see his face okay it has to be the choice of the father to
23:28
allow you to do that but if he decides to do it who's going to stand there and say no you can't do it now
23:33
here's a follow-up question if you are a detailed portrait artist
23:39
that really knows how to draw a portrait if you or that if you had that gift could you draw
23:45
the face of god is it that clear to you well i actually kind of did sketch it in
23:52
our in our one calendar um the last one that we just made there is
23:57
a picture of god the father sitting on the throne um you can just see an outline of it you
24:03
can see fire in his eyes but i could and i think some people know
24:08
this and some don't but one of the times i was with the father the father said because you're willing to do this for me
24:14
and just give up your whole life to love people to share the truth to not change anything i will gift you
24:21
with the ability to paint details about heaven itself exactly what it looks like
24:26
and i will add the glory to it so that is coming i can't say how many years down the road that will happen but i
24:32
will assure you since he told me that was a gift for me it will so one day i will and yes i could do that that's good
24:39
now i i also one i was going to mention this a minute ago when you said
24:44
he takes me out of my body i don't choose when i go and visit so i i've repeated this before but you tell
24:52
at one time when you're shopping you lit reach up to get an item on the on the grocery
24:57
shelf and between the time you pick that up and put it in your cart you've gone to
25:03
heaven had a visitation and come back is that about right and how long was the visit did the
25:08
visitation seem at a time like that well since there's no clocks or time in
25:14
heaven you don't you don't necessarily think even think that like how long have i been here
25:19
only if the one time i do know i glanced at my clock when the father said he was
25:24
going to show me his heart and i happened to glance over at my clock i was in my bedroom
25:29
and i knew what time it was and i was in heaven for four hours earth time that time that's when he was showing me how
25:35
he made the soul the operations of the soul how to do a soul checkup so he gave
25:40
me so much revelation i i understand why it probably took longer than normal but
25:46
it depends on how many places i think the way i can kind of figure it out is does he show me more than one thing uh
25:52
does he take me back in time and bring me back does he talk about it then show me two other places in heaven that would
25:58
probably be a while but my family this is uh literally a lot of this happened before i actually started my offices in
26:05
my home and so it didn't matter you know it didn't matter but was out busy with
26:10
their own lives who live here my mom my sister my husband myself they knew he always took me after after
26:17
i woke up so he never takes me in a dream i never dream i don't sleep long enough to dream it was always when i
26:22
first woke up when he would take me places usually or if i even love to go somewhere he'd take me like we talked
26:28
about in the grocery store pulling up in the driveway he would just take me wow um and so nobody actually was it wasn't
26:35
like they were running around with a stopwatch if my husband came in any time and said something to me and i was
26:40
staring um not saying anything at all i didn't answer him my husband would just say to
26:46
me i'll come back later and then he would leave and i hey are you aware when he comes in
26:51
even though you're in heaven are you aware of both places i'm not aware of anything at all going on the earth i am
26:58
in heaven my soul is in my spirit man and that's where you see you hear you
27:03
understand uh i don't i know some other people may have but i'm totally unaware of what's
27:08
going on around me at all i'm there i'm focused on that if if they're talking to you in heaven father senator holy spirit
27:15
you're not going to sit up there thinking well how long has it been what's going on down there you won't care that's good that's good that's good
27:22
all right um and this is a question you might have just
27:28
addressed but it says did you have to intentionally seek the lord for months or years basically saying please let me
27:35
go to heaven to be able to be get to get there uh did you did you do that no i
27:40
never did that i did seek him for many years uh many years we're talking
27:46
about the lord now i'm talking about the lord i wanted to know him uh you know i
27:51
always loved uh john in the relationship he had i didn't want the same relationship john had i wanted my own
27:57
intimate relationship with the son of god and i didn't want to know him for anything to get anything back from him i
28:03
literally wanted to know him and so i would seek him all the time and
28:08
um it's like i would hear him every now and then and i would see him off and on
28:14
but that's still not really knowing something that's not in relationship intimate means you know you know their
28:19
heart their mind you know who they are what they're all about what what their favorite things are they love to do what
28:26
their plans are that's creating a relationship which is what jesus wants with every person
28:32
that wasn't just me but i chose to pursue him on purpose and no i didn't spend hours on my face
28:38
seeking him i already was an intercessor i mean special time just to build a relationship with him i get in a room
28:44
and shut the door and say i'm here to talk to you sometimes it was late at night because i always stayed up late not just now and i
28:51
went on purpose just wait and there was nobody around shut the door say i'm here to talk to you and i talked to him just
28:57
like he was there because i did believe he was there that he was hearing me and then several years later he just
29:04
walked through the wall like the father does and he came and i was undone and he has never stopped visiting me so he
29:11
visited me before he started taking me up to heaven so being around him or being with him and
29:18
understanding him that happened before the commission came i i was quite
29:23
surprised with the commission he gave me because i was not somebody who wanted to speak publicly i didn't necessarily have
29:29
to be around a lot of people if you think i do this so i get all the attention you don't know me
29:35
i'm still a private person and i love my time with the father with the son with
29:40
holy spirit holy spirit's my best friend i got filled with him at age 18. again being a seer i saw him come inside
29:47
of me when i was born again at age four and then again at age five just to set the record straight
29:53
i i saw jesus christ step inside of me so i knew he was in there you get a
29:58
layer of him that's how he does it he's a mini-layered being your soul has many layers in it and he can take a layer of
30:05
your soul and take it to another country and let it preach the gospel when you believe on jesus christ he takes a layer
30:10
of your soul that's you and sets it in heavenly places so there really is a part of you seated in heavenly places
30:16
that is you that represent you there and and why did you just now introduce the holy spirit as your best
30:23
friend and you didn't say jesus is or the father is is there because the bible does talk about fellowship of the holy
30:28
spirit where he doesn't say that about the father and son but why did you just describe the holy spirit as your best
30:34
friend because he's there all the time he talks to me all the time he makes me laugh he
30:39
says funny things he he loves to tell jokes and he knows of course what you're
30:45
thinking his whole part of being in you is to help lead you and guide you into truth show you things to come i mean
30:52
that's why he's there and i allow him to do it all i actually say i give you permission to show me anything you want
30:58
me to know and even if i'm not paying attention i give you permission to get my attention the more of you you allow
31:04
them to use and say it to them the more excited they get knowing well they really care they do want to know uh not
31:11
that they don't know they can trust us they do know but uh saying something like that them shows them you want a
31:17
relationship with them and so holy spirit is like my best friend uh jesus is my beloved he's my bridegroom he's my
31:24
king that's who he is and he rules and he's ruling fiercely right now against evil on our behalf and he had told me a
31:31
long time ago i was sitting on the front row of our church which i always kept a sketch pad with me i saw him come in
31:37
with chariots of fire into the sanctuary wow this is a place that holds like four
31:42
to five thousand people and he came in and blazed a fire and he stepped off
31:47
that chariot and i fell on the floor and he picked up my head and he said you tell my people when i come back the next
31:53
time it won't be to rapture them out it will be to rule with them as king on this world wow
31:59
that's amazing um okay this is a funny question but this is one that you and i had worked
32:05
out a couple years ago and the question is is heaven a literal place and i don't even know
32:11
the basis of that is it a literal place versus what a spiritual i don't i'm not quite sure what what they mean proper
32:18
term is it is a literal place even though it is a spiritual world everything in there is spiritually made
32:26
um that's why angels who are spiritual beings can pass through these physical walls these physical walls don't keep
32:33
them from from transporting or bringing things or coming and going the spiritual
32:38
realm is the first realm ever made it's it's always been made as far as i know
32:43
and so the world called heaven the father's house is a world it's not a building
32:49
and everyone thinks of it not everyone many people think of it as just a building it's it's a house like this
32:55
house no it's an entire world people he made everything ever existed the father
33:00
would speak the word would step out of him and go make it they did a lot of the things together um but it's a spiritual world so you
33:07
have a literal existence in your spiritual body inside this body
33:13
is a spiritual body that looks just like me but much younger my spiritual body looks like i'm in my
33:19
20s and i feel with life and excitement all the time uh the things of this world
33:25
aren't attached to my spirit man my soul cannot be separated from your spirit man
33:30
although some people that's why soul sleep is impossible your soul is never sleeping it doesn't
33:36
need to it's a spiritual part of you your spirit man never sleeps okay it doesn't have to sleep uh the physical
33:43
body needs rest in order to be able to to make it through the day but the day that you are glorified he will glorify
33:51
and put your spirit man inside your body will be there forever never be separated again by death you can't die when you're
33:58
glorified you can't sin when you're glorified christ is in his glorified body now on the day the dead in christ
34:03
will rise your bodies which died will be joined to your spirit man that's been in heaven he'll put them together put the
34:10
glory in it and you never get sick die sin ever again so even you go on a journey in
34:18
your life but right now inside this physical body is a spiritual body that thinks that has
34:24
emotions that love certain foods you still have your favorite kind of food you like and colors and stuff in heaven
34:30
so there's a literal place your mansion you will live in that mansion your spiritual body you'll sit on your
34:36
furniture invite friends over you'll have dinners you'll you go on events all over heaven together uh you'll transport
34:43
together uh sometimes on color on waves of light there's different ways to transport in heaven but it is a literal
34:50
world it says to be absent from this body people so scratch the soul sleeping
34:56
to be absent what is absent from your body why would they say that right
35:02
why does it say to be absent who's absent from it your spirit man with your soul
35:07
that will leave because it doesn't want to be buried well it's still
35:12
you wouldn't like that throw it in a casket shut it off and see if you like that you don't like it right because
35:18
your spirit man is still alive your soul is alive that goes with jesus christ to
35:23
live in heaven no soul sleeps scratching off your list and guess what and so speaking speaking
35:29
of literal literal you said you just said your favorite foods and all that so if i love pizza yeah i'm going to get
35:36
pizza in heaven right if i it'll be the best pizza you ever had and the people who will be making it were the ones who
35:43
had the gift who are gifted by god your gift that will never be taken away he is
35:48
not talking about spiritual gifts people okay they don't need a fivefold in heaven don't get upset or get offended
35:54
whatever your hobby is or the greatest passion he gave you that you love you'll be doing that like fishing playing golf
36:01
just visiting people maybe having events um but they don't need people to get saved or healed or encouraged or
36:08
inspired they don't even need to be taught the word of god you go to word university and the ones who wrote that book in the bible teach you that book so
36:16
you need to you need to get your mind set heaven is a spectacular place that no one has ever understood or unders you
36:22
know understands or knows about except the spirit of god shows you so yes it
36:27
does say in the word it is possible to know and understand those things if the spirit of god shows you so scratch the
36:34
whole thing that you can't go to heaven unless you die scratch it out because the spirit of god takes you to show you
36:41
something you will literally see there's real life there yes you know people that you knew on earth you'll probably live
36:47
near your family members is the most fantastic amazing place ever but it's a literal place he doesn't make a mansion
36:54
that you're just going to walk by and look at and say well that's my mansion you're going to live in it that's going to be the address you have in heaven and
37:00
one mansion could be the size of new york city so get out of your box of thinking you're going to have a cabin if
37:06
you have a cabin it's probably inside your mansion so and and two questions together so
37:12
when you say world you mean like a globe world or it's round
37:17
is a globe a smear okay so we've got the answer to that and then if there are
37:23
buildings on it like your mansion's a building um does that mean if you're outside you
37:29
could point over there and say well in that building over there is where the throne of god is would it be like that
37:37
i think everybody knows where the throne room is but yes you literally could and
37:43
people will want to visit your mansion you'll have guests all the time the disciples the prophets people you knew
37:48
in the past people in your family line from a thousand years ago who already know that you're a family member they'll
37:54
want to come and visit you and your mansions most of the mansions are very very big and they come with a lot of
38:01
property i don't even know no one knows the dimensions but it says in the bible the
38:08
earth is a shadow of heaven it's a shadow
38:13
well heaven is a world people and it's round that means the earth is round so get off
38:19
the boat that says the earth is flat that is not even possible in the natural
38:25
to be living in a flat earth people and yet there's the center of the earth there's other side of the earth i mean
38:31
people there's a horizon you travel by plane you can see the curve that's right my boat you don't fall off the edge
38:38
hello uh and i do know that just so this is for free the holy spirit always makes me
38:43
talk about this he doesn't like it when people call it the flat earth because heaven's not flat and if earth is a
38:49
shadow of heaven you're saying heaven is flat and they don't have it flat they don't want it flat it is a whole world
38:57
filled with the glory that stream off of it you see the colors of the rainbow shooting off of this whole world bigger
39:02
than our entire galaxy and so there's plenty of room for people to come and live there but yes your
39:08
mansion you can actually say uh this is my mansion this is where i live this is what god has made for me
39:14
and your family members have already been to your mansion putting gifts in it so when you come home to heaven one day
39:19
you have a throne room party celebration then you go to your mansion and have another one with all your family members
39:25
and the gifts they have gotten for you the ones who live there have gotten you gifts of things that you love and like to do and they'll be
39:32
waiting for you in your mansion awesome awesome awesome okay um now here's one
39:37
that could be a whole program in itself but it's one that you and i worked out
39:43
together what happens the moment i die assuming we're going to be with the lord
39:49
and not the other place what happens to the moment well i know answers to both but today
39:55
we'll talk about heaven yeah talk about him um number one you have to understand if
40:01
you belong to jesus christ and maybe it happened maybe you died someone died out in the wilderness or
40:06
they maybe they i don't know maybe there's an explosion or a big fire or something and your heart is still grieving because
40:12
you think they died alone number one nobody dies alone if you're going to
40:18
heaven your guardian angels are with you from the time actually before you're born they're sent to be outside the mother
40:25
you're guarding angels when you step out of this body i've been present when a lot of people have passed it was it's
40:31
quite wonderful for me as a seer i could see all the angels rush in the room if i was in the hospital room but somebody
40:37
the angels would literally rush in the room and gather around the person who's about to pass and and then they literally sometimes
40:44
they'll hold their hand out and it's at that moment they will step out of their body you know when they said jesus gave up
40:50
the goats that means he let go of the spirit man so we could leave his physical body on the cross well that's
40:56
the same thing that happens when somebody dies your physical body your physical body lets go it stops breathing
41:02
your spirit man steps out on its own uh is you got your arms and your legs just
41:07
like you do now excitement floods your being wow
41:12
no fear no pain no sickness no disease nothing missing
41:19
you are perfect in every way your spirit man if you're a believer you're young looking
41:25
jesus may come himself to get you sometimes he'll bring a family member with him to meet you oh really and his
41:32
own chariot so all i know is that joy floods you
41:37
right then the second you give up this physical body no matter what state it's in uh you are filled with the life of
41:44
god the excitement expectancy knowing you're going home to heaven you don't even still know how that's going to
41:50
happen you don't even care you're so excited here's your guardian angels with you you know sometimes jesus or
41:55
sometimes a family member actually may be allowed to come from heaven to go up
42:00
with you and it depends on if you go i see these glorified like elevators one appears it opens and your angels escort
42:07
you into that thing and zipped you right up there sometimes you go by chariot
42:12
there's different ways that you can be taken to heaven but you're already filled with life and excitement life
42:18
your body just died you didn't you're still very much alive but the life of god begins to flood you with joy
42:25
and excitement and expectation uh you can't wait to get there so number one
42:30
you never die alone number two the second this body stops functioning you
42:36
really begin to live at that moment when your spirit man pops out and your soul
42:41
is still with you so that's what you think about that your will what you choose and your emotions that you
42:46
display all that is in you only there's nothing negative there's like i said before no
42:52
fear no pain no handicaps can you imagine some people seeing for the first time that were
42:58
blind can now run they can jump um it's a it's
43:03
a time it's a time of celebration you're going home to celebrate in heaven you're not going home to weep and cry
43:10
and have regrets and and be upset about things if that's all left behind you're
43:16
just filled with god from the moment you step out of this body so seriously very much alive the
43:22
people that may be afraid of death because the people are afraid of death it's a big
43:28
fear they may be breathing their last and in severe pain
43:33
but they need to know that seconds from now they may be in the greatest joy they've ever been that's
43:40
right it really is that drastic of a change and i do want to encourage people
43:46
that when jesus came in person and told me the father and he were giving me a commission to reveal heaven to earth
43:53
although i never asked for i never sought them for it it's a commission that's something they decide to do
44:00
they already knew my life they knew my heart they knew that i would obey no matter what i mean in my own life i do obey
44:08
when you know them personally it's not because they're watching it's your heart to make them glad and when
44:15
you the more you obey it becomes like breathing what does that mean that means you don't even sin is not an option
44:21
there's no sin i don't sin why would i sin i have relationship with those who hold
44:27
life itself i want to bless them so i've learned the joy of obedience there's
44:33
nothing like it you're so free of evil and darkness there's no darkness in me i'm filled with the light in the life of
44:38
god and that's how you feel when you step out of this body this life is left
44:44
behind you don't forget your loved ones you start making places for them to visit preparing them for for them to come to
44:50
heaven you you sing happy birthday to them every even though they don't keep track of time they know when your birthday is
44:56
on the earth they'll go to a portal in heaven and literally sing to you happy birthday and then they will go get a
45:01
gift in heaven and take it to your mansion so every year you are apart from however many people you go out there
45:08
that's why so many people have so many gifts they won't forget you and when you step out of this body you're so filled
45:15
knowing you're about to see the face of your lord the face of his father and and
45:20
all that heaven has has been prepared for you you're excited so good now you
45:25
uh this just occurs to me we you know there are especially among women you think of them as having girlfriends
45:32
where they do everything together two three three three women or three girls and they've always done everything
45:39
together assuming they all go to to be with the lord do do we see them through
45:44
eternity doing just so many things together because they did and now
45:50
yes that's very good your best friends if they're not saved you get them saved for heaven's sakes
45:57
for heaven's sake really make sure that they know jesus christ or at least introduce him to them so they know that
46:02
he really does exist i know some people think well they may not want to hear that but really i think your number one
46:09
commission is to share with those who are closest to you that he is very real that he did die for us he wants to know
46:16
them and they want eternity there with jesus christ and yes families do i see
46:22
families doing things all over heaven together best friends doing things together and this is our eternity it but
46:29
it only gets better people go it's better than heaven the new earth
46:34
i won't bring that up unless it's brought up but i can tell you this this place you go to now the
46:40
father's house and they all call it the father's house a world the whole world prepare prepare with the most amazing
46:47
things filled with awe and splendor and a wonder to be caught up in a wonder you don't even know what that means for me
46:54
to say those words but we're not god's not i can't i'll feel them all over me right now we aren't
47:01
not going to escape seeing the glory on the earth it's going to happen and that is why god is going to deal with the
47:08
wickedness and evil they they they're like a dust they're like dusty they cannot stop him from doing what he's got
47:14
planned and right now satan would like to stop those planes i know i'm getting off the boat and going no go for it go
47:20
for it and you need to understand you have a future so great on the earth
47:25
right now that's really good no one else before us has lived experienced walked
47:31
in uh operated in had dominion in and satan is so terrified of us as the body
47:39
he's so terrified he thought i'm gonna make a play for this right now i'm taking it now i won't wait for the
47:44
perils times i won't wait for the tribulation i'll just take it now and have it a lot longer i destroy lives now
47:50
i'll still kill and destroy and keep them from achieving their destiny nobody will ever know about the glory filling
47:55
the earth nobody ever will receive the fire of god invading them
48:00
and i laugh and let me tell you on the thrones they're laughing at hell they're laughing at satan they're not laughing
48:07
at the things you're going through but they know what your end is that's it
48:12
they know and i'm not saying this to be flippant but if they die and go to heaven they're in a better place than you are right now
48:19
they're so filled with life joy excitement they know what god's going to do with you who are still alive on the earth so as long as you're here live for
48:26
the glory carry it release it wreak havoc in hell be dangerous against
48:31
hell every day of your life and let me tell you when this mess is over you will be so fierce against the darkness and
48:37
the evil that you will not be afraid of anything because the enemy would like you to stay
48:42
afraid so you do nothing open your mouth and say something that's good can't do anything else you rule with your words
48:51
your words make a difference in the spirit realm you if you can see the demons run and scream every time you get
48:56
up and declare the things that god is going to do they don't want to hear them they want to see you crush down push
49:02
back have no hope hope is here it's always been here jesus walked on
49:08
this earth died on this earth wreaked havoc in hell took away the gemstones
49:14
from satan took the keys of hell death and the grave which now he doesn't control anymore he owns them
49:21
christ owns those keys and let me tell you don't ever give up on your family members
49:27
stand in the gap for them because your words make a difference even on their eternity and their eternal decision so i
49:34
have to say this because god wants the power of god to be released and understanding
49:39
you carry that as a believer and follower of jesus christ you're not weak he didn't leave you weak he didn't leave
49:45
you helpless he filled you full of him his son holy spirit and let me tell you this darkness knows it and they're
49:52
terrified these wicked evil people will think they're getting away i'm telling you it's like god turning a page
49:58
and when he's done with it all he'll turn a page and they will be like dust and we'll be into the next part of our
50:04
life which is acceleration so all of heaven is watching us right now in the earth let them hear you shout
50:10
glory to god let them hear you praise his name let them hear you say i'm willing to do what you want god i'm
50:16
excited to be alive right now that's what they want to hear you say awesome awesome now
50:23
let me a quick follow-up on that question because we talked about if they if you were three best friends
50:28
on earth yes if they're all saved that they would be like that in heaven so i'm hearing in my mind's eye my mind's ear
50:36
whatever someone's saying i've never had a best friend in my life i've never been one people i don't
50:43
relate to people as well they seem to be off put i've never been among two or three of us that
50:49
just did things together i don't even know what to think about that what about that person in heaven will god
50:56
give them a best friend if you even know how to i don't know if you know how to answer that but i'm quite sure you will
51:02
have so many best friends you won't know what to do with them because no one is alone in heaven
51:08
there's no one left alone sitting on a rock somewhere saying well i'm lonely i'm here but i still don't have anybody
51:14
i won't laugh okay but i can tell you everybody
51:19
makes friends if they never had a friend in heaven that's huge you will love having that
51:27
friend in your life you don't go through heaven or eternity alone
51:32
and the people go well i have the father the father is amazing just to be with and hear the stories he has to tell you
51:39
you know he really is the storyteller and uh and he does still like to tell stories powerful amazing stories and you
51:47
want you will want to be with him and jesus christ everybody wants to be with jesus in heaven he is a character with a capital c
51:54
wherever he goes in heaven people run after him just to be with him just to hear him sometimes he'll send for you
51:59
just to be with him now if you had a really great friend in heaven that could
52:05
be jesus christ but holy spirit will bombard you all the time in heaven he's not going to leave you out either but
52:11
you will have real friends that lived on the earth that you will do amazing things and you'll be surprised that some
52:18
people like the same thing you do you get to go do all those wild fun things or go into the glory walk into the glory
52:25
visit the father in his chambers uh visit the the valley of the falls you know or or the mountainous spices or
52:32
christmas town or the the the they have a i call a jungle but it's actually like a
52:38
like a rain forest in heaven where people actually the mansions are in these massive trees and can you imagine
52:44
ringing or doing they don't know what ziplining is to go to heaven filled with excitement joy your gifts
52:51
are used the art there is amazing it all comes to life i mean how could you not
52:57
so i know sitting in this physical body not really understanding how can i live
53:02
in a spiritual world you're in your spiritual body it's just like you touch the road you run on the road the streets
53:08
of gold you open the doors you don't pass through them but there's portals you can jump through and be under the
53:14
crystal sea and swim with the sharks and the fish and everything or i mean how could you not
53:20
have an amazing life uh all of heaven celebrates just when
53:25
one believer comes home that's awesome so you think it's going to be boring
53:30
it's never boring in heaven that was good and that was good about the extra i never asked that question before and i'm
53:37
going to ask one other uh now versus then so on this earth we're all aware there's the pretty
53:43
people we sometimes call them the beautiful people and they were gifted by god they're beautiful or they're
53:49
handsome and then there are people that are that no one would disagree they're not you
53:54
know they're just not beautiful they're not handsome they're not uh talk about what it's like
54:00
once those uh people that always said i just wasn't beautiful like all these other people and then they go to heaven
54:07
talk about that i've never asked that question you have to understand uh the goodness you carried and that you
54:14
did for people it it enhances your own appearance in heaven
54:20
the thing that people notice the most in heaven is how much light you having have coming from you really maybe nobody knew
54:26
you but maybe all you did was help maybe help i don't know go to a food bank and
54:32
deliver food or maybe dished up soup maybe you just said hi to the elderly
54:37
people that never had anybody talk to them you are actually uh you're you're building
54:43
glory in yourself but in heaven your whole features are enhanced a no one in
54:49
heaven is not beautiful you're so filled with the beauty of god and his glory his
54:56
love and the life of god coming from you even if you you thought you were never known by anybody but people in heaven
55:02
know who you are and people will want to know you in heaven it's just the way heaven is everybody wants to know you uh
55:09
they want to do things with you even if you've never met them before but you will like
55:14
what you look like in heaven you will like in other words your nose isn't going to be wrong on one side
55:20
right on the other end you don't have no because your physical body which is dead
55:26
that's what gets risen up your spiritual body is made perfect your spiritual body is made perfect in every way your spirit
55:32
mean is perfect there's nothing discolored there's nothing uneven there's nothing the parts aren't missing
55:38
uh you all have glorious hair uh even if you never had hair you're gonna have lots of hair in heaven just
55:44
this might make somebody hap somebody's gonna be happy about that but but women you don't have to put
55:49
makeup on you don't have to try to make yourself look better you love who you are you love who god made you to be
55:57
and you're gonna like your spirit your spirit person you're gonna like that you're gonna like it a lot that's really really really good all right yo i just
56:04
want to add one more thing the holy spirit said please add this people will walk up to you and they will say man do
56:09
you look good oh that's awesome yeah yeah i mean and you know what it strikes
56:16
me is there's people on the earth who they know they always look good they go
56:22
yeah you're right about that you said that they'd say i know that's why i do modeling and stuff but
56:29
but that's that's comes as really good news to people who who never had that identity they would go yeah
56:36
it's something that is you get you have to get used to it almost people who've never been complimented before they will
56:43
and it's not about giving you pride it's really just saying how amazing god has blessed you uh within your appearance in
56:50
heaven so uh maybe someone you never knew or thought would want to know you they'll come running up and say hi i
56:57
couldn't wait to meet you uh you have the glory of god all over you you know
57:02
you just you just i i can just feel his presence around you and so there's other attributes you have
57:08
that you don't think of in this physical body are being seen in the physical body that are seen in your spirit man
57:15
so well good all right here's one that happens is asked a lot
57:20
will i be married in heaven what is the relationship like between people who who were married on earth in heaven so
57:27
that's what people want to know they can't and this we get asked this all the time i know how could i possibly
57:34
be so happily married in heaven and then not be with my husband or wife for all
57:40
for all eternity you know my dad used to saying he was so wrong okay
57:46
i honor him he's with the lord now but he he used to say in public he'd say if
57:52
if there's no marriage in heaven you have to give the devil credit for a better plan and that was wrong
57:58
you know he just could not conceive of being without a wife in heaven so talk
58:04
about that a little bit i will say there is marriage in heaven and it's talked about in the bible people
58:11
you will all be married to jesus christ and i know in the mind of men especially
58:17
with us just bizarre no no the the coming together of a husband
58:22
and wife on the earth is symbolic of the relationship the oneness will
58:27
have jesus it's a spiritual oneness uh you'll actually be able to go inside of
58:32
each other and i know that sounds wild maybe you don't even understand that but you know if you ask me the truth i have to tell you the truth
58:39
there is no marriage in heaven except to jesus christ okay it says that very
58:45
plainly uh you're married till death do you part because when you go to heaven
58:51
you only have one person he'll be married to you the marriage supper of the lamb it is a
58:58
bridal celebration and you will and let me tell you as much as you love that person as your spouse
59:05
whether you or the husband or wife you will love jesus a million times more
59:11
not in that physical way but in the love even beyond physical things
59:17
and i know you don't understand that either but you will you will the first time you meet him
59:23
everyone in heaven loves to be with jesus and yes you will remember you were
59:28
married and because this is probably going to be a question if you're married three times and your spouse died the
59:34
other two times in heaven you will be three best friends that's what you will be best friends
59:41
because no one is married and the father actually took time to explain that to me is that i couldn't allow
59:48
marriage from the earth to be carried over to heaven because then they would be committing something that's wrong
59:53
yeah yeah can you commit a bigamy in heaven people you can't have more than
59:59
one you're married to jesus christ he is the one that the wedding supper is being prepared for we are the bride of christ
1:00:07
all of us who are believers we will they'll have a massive ceremony in heaven where you will get to see with
1:00:13
jesus christ you will be married to him everyone for all time you'll be best friends with your husband and wife that
1:00:19
you had on the earth you'll live right near each other your whole family will do things together and you'll add family
1:00:25
who are there like i said a thousand years before you ever arrived if they were in your family line
1:00:30
you have so many other relationships and activities in heaven but your number one
1:00:36
for all eternity is going to be jesus christ wow now i want to ask a related question
1:00:43
about relationships i've asked this um online before but not in this flow but
1:00:48
uh and i've said my my younger sister i love her dearly but and she was
1:00:53
she was absolutely abused by my father both sisters were and she said to me
1:00:59
this is probably 10 15 years ago she said if if dad is in heaven i don't want to go i want i don't even want to go
1:01:06
talk about that because my because her dad our father is with the lord now he's re he repented
1:01:13
before he went he repented and even asked for forgiveness multiple times so how in the world is she going to
1:01:21
love the man that abused her on earth what talk about that if you can because
1:01:26
number one your physical body with your physical brain is not going to be in heaven
1:01:33
your spirit man in your soul it depends on the relationship you have with jesus christ if you're born again
1:01:39
if you receive christ as your savior uh your name is written in the lamb's book of life you can't escape going to heaven
1:01:46
and let me tell your alternative you don't want and let me tell you forgiveness will
1:01:51
flood your soul and when you see your father or whoever it was that did the
1:01:56
abusing ye will love them and i know that sounds crazy but that's heaven and no it's not unfair
1:02:03
it's not especially if like steve said i'm talking now about his family
1:02:08
he asked for forgiveness people it's wrong for you to say i don't accept the forgiveness i mean you need to forgive
1:02:15
you need to forgive and you can say i forgive and choose to forget is even better because i promise you you will go
1:02:22
to heaven one day but you won't have the same emotions your physical man has when
1:02:28
the body dies your body and all that stuff that was hanging on to it is left in the grave
1:02:35
and when you come back later on when the dead and christ will rise that won't be there that same feelings you had your
1:02:41
soul and your spirit man when it's brought back together on that day when that happens it'll be like it's still
1:02:48
you you'll still know you're you but you will think differently love differently and live differently and so i always say
1:02:55
let god handle it just go home to heaven say i'm going to heaven and don't talk about the other if you
1:03:00
can't talk about it just don't talk about it but i can assure you that
1:03:05
i don't even know how to explain the power of love real
1:03:10
absolute unabandoned love with with nothing attached to it but
1:03:17
pure love begins to invade your person when your body is dead and that spirit
1:03:24
man steps out you will be invaded with that love before you ever get to heaven
1:03:30
you'll be invaded with his presence his person his love his life you'll be invaded then
1:03:36
and you will be so undone stand there a few a few seconds before that you were feeling and thinking
1:03:41
differently you now it's like dust it falls off of you and you will step into a whole new way of living before you
1:03:48
ever get to heaven and only because of love that's why it says love is the greatest thing that
1:03:54
ever existed is love perfect love cast out all fear not just fear i cast out regret a cast out anger
1:04:01
cast out unforgives it it just casts it out and when i say unforgiveness i'm not talking about
1:04:08
there's an unforgiveness that's not like a sin there is one that is that it says
1:04:14
if you do not forgive you will not be forgiven that is the type such is almost evils attached to that type of
1:04:20
unforgiveness and uh and you want them to die and you want them to never exist and you despise
1:04:26
hate in so much almost like the devil hates okay it has to be to that degree
1:04:31
most people are angry or upset or hurt and they say i can't but when they get to heaven they can't wait to see them
1:04:38
and say you know what forgive you wow and that person will be saying i don't
1:04:43
even think about it i'm just so happy you're here i just love you so much i uh maybe i should have treated you better
1:04:50
but right now i'll just love you through all eternity that's this is the encounters people have in heaven
1:04:55
they already have that love put in them before they ever get to heaven there's no question that there's no question
1:05:02
that they'll be able to say uh you know i do i do forgive you no you ask and i didn't want it but i just want you know
1:05:07
i love you i'm filled with the love of god so i think it's the hardest thing for people to understand in your physical
1:05:14
body you think this is all there is your human brain you know in your human
1:05:19
emotions the flesh emotions you think you'll be that way all your life but you
1:05:25
won't you know i i heard a story once it seems like it was a relative but i can't remember for sure
1:05:32
she was she was being murdered she was being stabbed and she
1:05:37
survived but in the process of her being stabbed she began to come out of her
1:05:44
body she began to die and her testimony is that as she began
1:05:49
to come and she thought she was dying all of a sudden she felt all of this love for this person that was in the
1:05:56
middle of stabbing her does that make sense it does make sense because it's god's
1:06:01
love it's his love if you the same way we can say it this way steve
1:06:07
as christ was dying on the cross and they were stabbing him
1:06:12
and they were being brutal to him while he's dying who forgave the people because he loved
1:06:19
them as they're murdering him and that was a murder on the cross even though it was god's way of having he had to have that
1:06:26
perfect person uh carry all sin and evil and wickedness and disease that had to be nailed to the
1:06:33
cross or christ couldn't have forgiven you he drank that in the garden so it was necessary he's not going to escape
1:06:40
the cross but even he said what did he say father forgive them they don't know
1:06:45
what they're doing in other words is he's dying for their salvation they were they were wicked and evil they were
1:06:51
murdering him that was painful and he said forgive them they don't know what they're doing in other words they don't
1:06:57
know they're murdering the very salvation that they need and yet christ i know we're not jesus christ but he
1:07:04
himself had to and was able to forgive these people as they were killing him i
1:07:09
always thought that that was you know until this moment i'm processing this with that other example
1:07:16
i always thought of him doing the noble thing and the right thing and
1:07:21
as you know forgive them you know as if he was doing it from his brain
1:07:26
but you're saying he literally felt felt what i described a minute ago loved
1:07:32
towards the people he literally loved them and he said don't lay this to
1:07:37
their church and and the question on there is when he said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing
1:07:43
i think stephen also said that when but did the lord actually forgive them at
1:07:49
that point because jesus his son said please forgive them were they forgiven
1:07:54
oh i'm sure that i'm sure as far as those acts that happened yeah
1:07:59
he he the father would have to forgive him for those acts that they committed as he was dying on the cross if he asked
1:08:06
them as the son of god dying for our sins and he asked the father forgive
1:08:11
them because they don't know what they're doing they didn't understand what they were doing they were reacting in the flesh in the natural if if people
1:08:19
were going to somebody's going to do that to any person they of course would be in in well in this country
1:08:26
they would have been imprisoned they would have been shot they would have been something there there would have been justice old western justice would
1:08:33
have been done to them because it says an eye for an eye you know it says for that in the bible and in the old testament talks about that uh back then
1:08:40
especially they did but because when christ came it changed a lot of things because christ asked from his own heart
1:08:47
forgive them father they didn't know what they were doing christ knew he had to go to the cross he said no man took
1:08:54
my life i laid it down and so people if you understood the
1:09:00
sovereignty the holiness that jesus walked in as a physical man he still was the son of god
1:09:07
but he had to walk as a man on the earth was tempted in every way we are right now and said no to all of it
1:09:13
don't think you can't say no to it you can even if you ask god help me to forgive
1:09:19
them i choose with my will is a good thing to say i choose my will to forgive that person for all they did to me and
1:09:25
guess what you choose to forgive them then that goes on your record you forgave them that's not going to ever be
1:09:31
against you god i actually asked god to don't even write it down if somebody
1:09:37
there's a lot of people that come against me and say hate and evil and wicked things and i my heart feels for
1:09:42
them because they don't know what they're doing either they don't know who they're saying that to they don't know what they're doing and i the highest
1:09:49
thing i can do for god is they forgive them don't even write it down so it's not even written in heaven
1:09:56
cat where you are where you've become in this part of your life everything you've been are you feeling that are you
1:10:03
feeling in your heart don't let them write down don't write it down because i feel this love towards them when they're
1:10:10
being wicked and evil toward you do you feel it now i really do feel it now i feel just god the love of god coming out
1:10:17
of me towards towards people who especially who are ignorant or people who don't know any other kind of life maybe they
1:10:24
were abused so they abused that's really what happens if your soul is trained as you're being raised up and what that
1:10:31
soul sees as a child what it hears as a child they will repeat it that isn't even necessarily a generational curse
1:10:37
that's what you put in the soul you're raising souls people they're not just children you're raising and shaping
1:10:42
the soul of somebody who got needs on the earth and so i have to let people hear me say
1:10:48
i forget them and a lot of people would get angry they would try to stand up for me or stick up for me and say don't even don't don't
1:10:54
bother doing that okay they're in god's hands but as far as i'm concerned i'm forgiving them and i'm asking him don't
1:11:00
even write it down you know what that does that torments the devil number one it does set the people free from what
1:11:06
they're doing because he's not writing he's not going to write it down now what they do later in their life and in other places and ways that's between them and
1:11:13
god but as far as something coming against me i'm trying to abuse against me i'm going to make sure that i let the
1:11:18
father know don't write that down because i forgive them and and in your understanding when you ask god don't
1:11:25
even write it down he complies if i can put that word he will comply because that's my desire
1:11:32
that's my will that it not be written down i don't want them held accountable so they lose their destiny or maybe he
1:11:38
brings severe justice against them because they're speaking against god's anointed and it totally talks about the
1:11:44
bible do not speak against my anointing he says that and uh whether i like it or not or anyone else i said i'm anointed
1:11:51
to do this and you're speaking against this is why i say i won't hold it
1:11:56
against them don't write it down but they're actually speaking against god himself
1:12:01
and his plans and his choice and that's why he says don't touch my anointed so
1:12:07
then he can decide from his side but as far as i'm concerned he won't write down
1:12:12
what they have said or try to do against me that's good that's really really good i think that's a good stopping point so
1:12:19
people will just really ponder that we're gonna play uh this uh american warriors that we told people about so
