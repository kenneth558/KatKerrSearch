the way uh i'm i'm going to say this
01:52
before i forget to make the announcement
01:53

01:55
might forget if i don't say it
01:57
you know we have cats we have questions
01:59
for cat already for today so we don't
02:01
need those uh our staff decided it would
02:03
be great to have you ask any and all
02:05
kinds of questions about christmas
02:08
as it relates to heaven or whatever cat
02:10
knows is seeing understands so ask your
02:13
questions about christmas for next
02:15
week's broadcast most of the
02:18
people put those questions underneath
02:21
the youtube not in the chat to the right
02:22
but underneath uh where you put your
02:24
comments where they stay there not the
02:26
ones that just disappear and roll off
02:28
the screen
02:29
um and there are other ways we get them
02:31
too some people have hit reply and do
02:33
different things that our preferred
02:35
method is below youtube um and we'll try
02:38
and look at other places as well but
02:39
that's we're going to tell you that
02:40
specific one so i want to thank
02:42
everybody for your amazing donations
02:45
yesterday we pretty much had an
02:47
unprecedented number of donations and we
02:49
really appreciate that this ministry is
02:51
really growing by leaps and bounds uh
02:54
after the first we've got several more
02:55
people we'll be bringing on board in
02:57
fact we'll make those announcements at
02:59
the right time just a few of those
03:01
we will announce like this
03:04
i think that some of you have seen
03:05
illumination who now works for us we we
03:08
got her by making the announcement on
03:10
the
03:11
air so we will be making some
03:12
announcements
03:13
uh either next week or after the first
03:15
i'll see what the staff wants to do and
03:17
then people can then begin to send those
03:19
in so we'll figure out how to do that
03:21
and give you an address
03:23
or email whatever the staff wants and
03:25
we'll tell you which positions we're
03:26
looking for so
03:28
but anyway thank you very much for your
03:29
generosity i know it's the as you we
03:32
approach the year end many of you are
03:34
trying to to determine what you want to
03:36
do with your what things you want to do
03:38
with your um final giving for the year
03:40
we certainly appreciate you thinking
03:42
about us you know i've said that we've
03:44
built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda
03:46
and and then we've doubled the size we
03:48
paid for the construction of doubling
03:51
the size of the health clinic
03:53
on in that ugandan village i haven't
03:54
even shown you that picture yet uh we
03:57
have to work we're committed to do 24 to
03:59
dig 24 new wells in and around that
04:02
community and region and some of you who
04:05
saw that video we'll show it several
04:06
more times you saw that the people were
04:09
drinking
04:10
some of them when the water is running
04:12
off of the piglet tree into the water
04:14
that they they put in their drinking
04:15
water and they bring it home it's just a
04:17
horrific thing so we're digging
04:19
freshwater wells thank you so much for
04:21
your i i would say your help you know
04:24
it's not just you helped us you did it
04:26

05:46
next week you probably heard that and we
05:49

05:51
you talked about christmas town all that
05:52
so i'll have you just kind of elaborate
05:54
on that next week so well
05:57
yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll
06:00
just jump in um before we have any
06:02
questions cat what kind of anything
06:04
current events you'd like to share
06:07
uh
06:08
well i do there are there are things out
06:10
there everybody knows about and things
06:12
people can't know about right now but i
06:14
i can continue to tell you that that
06:17
foundation of the left is crumbling
06:20
um there's other people leaving their
06:22
positions because they're being exposed
06:25
in that is privately
06:27
that i can't announce who that is but
06:30
that big support this is the thing when
06:33
you lose your support like you were
06:35
saying you can't do anything that is
06:36
absolutely true but guess what it's also
06:38
true for the left
06:40
all the people who are jumping on that
06:42
bandwagon are jumping off many of them
06:45
are jumping off some of those are really
06:47
big supporters and i can tell you bottom
06:50
line why i can tell you why they want to
06:52
have money left over
06:54
because they keep being asked for more
06:56
and more and more you can't give
06:57
yourself to something that is totally
07:00
darkness and think they're going to let
07:03
you go how about if i give you that as a
07:05
tip
07:05
you can't do it you can run in
07:07
and agree and participate with things
07:10
that are evil
07:11
and think that will let you go
07:14
i can also tell a story about that there
07:17
are people who were part of an extreme
07:19
dark uh uh thing that was going on this
07:22
is probably maybe 15 years ago
07:24
and they actually had seen demons talk
07:27
to demons and not trying to scare
07:28
anybody they gave permission
07:31
they gave permission and they thought
07:33
what they got to do was exciting and
07:35
amazing but guess what they wouldn't let
07:37
them go they tormented them for the next
07:40
10 years of their life
07:42
and and they just couldn't get rid of
07:44
they didn't get rid of them because you
07:46
can't give yourself to something it's
07:49
like what god says what you enter into
07:52
will enter into you and that's how
07:54
simply something that's one liners of
07:56
some of the most powerful things he ever
07:58
says to me but what you choose to enter
08:00
into will enter into your soul that's
08:02
just what happens and either you think
08:04
about it you want to run after it or
08:06
else you give them a tie to you and
08:08
these people actually gave a tie
08:11
to to this these beings that were um
08:14
beginning to torment them when they were
08:16
done with the fun thing they thought
08:17
they were going to be a part of which
08:18
was dark was really bad i'm not going to
08:20
tell you what that was but they couldn't
08:22
get rid of them finally they had to
08:24
repent
08:25
and and cleanse their soul and every
08:28
every place they lived they had a place
08:30
that the demons would always come in at
08:31
night and torment him they couldn't do
08:33
anything about it
08:34
so they had somebody get hold of me
08:37
i didn't meet with them i told them what
08:39
they would have to do and they could
08:40
never ever go to that place again
08:43
and they would have to just you know
08:45
make sure that they
08:46
got that out of their soul number one
08:48
but they actually had to renounce
08:50
anything or any hold or tie that
08:53
darkness have with them that they gave
08:55
permission to that's the difference and
08:58
people who are just maybe attacked every
09:00
now and then that's it that's illegal
09:02
that's taken to the course of heaven
09:04
sometimes and sometimes god just comes
09:06
in supernaturally and ends that that's
09:09
like an attack this is not what these
09:11
people were doing they willingly
09:13
participated in these evil acts that
09:15
were happening somewhere and that's why
09:18
it took longer to get rid of it they
09:21
finally broke it they have had no no
09:24
nothing else come they stopped coming
09:26
they severed that tie they severed that
09:29
portal that was open by their own
09:31
repentance and then um having to take
09:33
communion over the whole thing and you
09:35
know what they attempted to come back
09:37
but they said they couldn't they served
09:38
only the living god they would not serve
09:41
the enemy again so that's why it's so
09:44
important to make sure you never get
09:46
into one of those places or participate
09:48
like that it's really hard to get rid of
09:50
and that's what people are finding out
09:52
now
09:52
who already have been a part of this
09:54
thing this year and a half long thing
09:56
that's been going on in our country
09:58
more and more people think i can make
10:00
money if i let them use me for this or
10:02
if i lie about this or if i cheat in
10:05
this way i'll make money well they're
10:07
finding out they're losing their money
10:08
that's what's happening they're losing
10:10
their money and once they make a tie or
10:13
a contract with this darkness that's
10:15
going on they won't let you go that's
10:18
why you don't want to participate in the
10:19
beginning you stand strong against
10:21
everything that's going on you keep
10:23
running after god right now in your life
10:26
and don't forget to celebrate he's still
10:28
saying that to me god has already seen
10:30
the beginning to the end he knows
10:32
exactly what will happen and i know
10:34
there's a lot of theories and
10:36
assumptions and people think they know
10:37
what's going to happen i can tell you
10:39
god is going to decide when that does
10:41
happen when it does it will be so great
10:43
you won't have to wonder if you'll hear
10:45
about it so this is just a tip to people
10:47
or those who are still in the darkness
10:49
you better get out while you can if you
10:52
don't you probably will lose everything
10:54
because this is an evil thing happening
10:56
in our country you cannot steal a
10:57
country you cannot give yourself to
10:59
satan or his evil ex and think he will
11:03
let go of you if you're already stepping
11:05
outside of that maybe you never got born
11:07
again you better get bored again really
11:09
quick
11:10
i will say that you better get born
11:11
again because that's probably the one
11:13
thing that can save you from all the
11:15
stuff you've been involved in but
11:17
there's already people they've already
11:18
got some people who are being witnesses
11:20
um to a lot of these accounts that
11:22
excuse me that are happening so i would
11:24
just encourage you and i'm gonna keep
11:26
doing it get out of that darkness while
11:28
you can
11:29
repent make sure you make sure you tell
11:32
somebody who is accountable
11:34
who is an authority in the area that's
11:37
just looking to see what's going on so i
11:40
just want to encourage people those
11:41
things are happening right now people
11:44
are uh they're distancing themselves
11:46
from some people they're actually
11:48
getting out of these things themselves
11:50
but people who have money are finding
11:53
that if something doesn't happen to stop
11:55
this whole thing they themselves will
11:58
have no money or property so let me tell
12:01
you evil will never bless you evil can't
12:04
create life or hope or something that's
12:06
going to help there is no help in evil
12:09
and darkness that comes from god that
12:11
comes from belonging to jesus christ so
12:14
all you who've been out there have been
12:15
strong and stayed strong and given hope
12:18
to people that that god does know what's
12:20
going on don't give up okay you got to
12:22
stay strong it says making your stand
12:24
and standing there for us i just want to
12:26
applaud you
12:28
yeah yeah
12:29
making a great stand for jesus christ
12:33
he made everything we know and see
12:36
nothing is hidden from him so if you
12:38
think because god's not saying anything
12:41
right now to everybody that does not
12:44
mean he doesn't he does have a plan he
12:46
he does he does have a plan for all of
12:48
this that's good ken i think you said
12:50
something a minute ago and i thought you
12:51
know i'm going to ask her to expound on
12:53
that you said people had sold out to
12:55
darkness and you got them into
12:57
repentance and to receiving the lord if
12:59
they hadn't but then you said
13:01
they took communion over that thing or
13:04
something to the that effect and you're
13:06
you're speaking about communion as if
13:08
it's a weapon
13:10
and let me just
13:11
ask you to expand uh expound on the
13:14
weapon of communion what does that
13:16
actually do
13:17
when people take communion
13:19
it is so powerful and
13:22
unfortunately most churches has just
13:24
become a tradition yeah
13:26
i will give you a good example of that i
13:29
remember
13:30
where i was attending at one time it had
13:32
become like a tradition
13:34
that doesn't make god very happy because
13:37
there is power in the blood of jesus
13:39
christ and his surrender totally to the
13:42
father's will and even his own
13:44
willingness to do he didn't have to do
13:47
anything at the cross and no matter what
13:49
people think don't take the crosses off
13:51
your wall now that you think he's not on
13:52
it anymore his own personal mark he
13:55
makes as a carpenter is a cross that's
13:58
what he does even in heaven when he
13:59
makes things that is significant
14:02
it means everything to all those who are
14:04
a believer who have received the the
14:07
sacrifice that christ did and died for
14:09
us he shed his own blood for us that is
14:11
a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks
14:14
things sometimes that nothing else can
14:18
and especially people if they've had
14:20
things going on in their house at night
14:22
maybe they may be familiar spirits or
14:24
other kind of spirits if there's nothing
14:26
else you can do you've prayed maybe
14:28
you've fasted you need to take communion
14:31
yourself over your property and then you
14:33
go outside and you pour some on the land
14:36
and say with the blood of jesus christ i
14:38
redeem this land a shockwave
14:41
of jesus christ will it tell you it will
14:44
embed itself in the property you're
14:46
living on and then you invite holy
14:49
spirit to invade it just invite the
14:51
spirit of god to invade it and let me
14:53
tell you what it'll be hard for anything
14:55
spiritually bad or evil to come on that
14:58
property it would be too painful for
15:00
them
15:00
taking communion is something some
15:03
people actually do every day
15:04
and i do it about once a month myself at
15:07
least sometimes more than that
15:10
and recently we just cleansed our land
15:12
again and let me tell you what the peace
15:15
of god with the presence of god will
15:17
infuse that the presence of god is in
15:19
communion
15:21
it represents many things it represents
15:23
the sec
15:25
reminds us of the sacrifice christ did
15:28
but it's something that brings us
15:30
together if you do that with your family
15:33
it will be so powerful in the spirit it
15:35
brings a bond with you and your family
15:38
together when you take that together
15:40
recognizing together as a family what
15:42
christ did for you
15:44
sometimes it opens things you never
15:46
could get open sometimes it breaks the
15:48
power of the enemy that nothing else
15:50
will break i even tell people who've
15:52
been sick for a long time you should be
15:54
taking communion over your body it says
15:57
very clearly in the bible what you know
16:00
what he did by his stripes what does it
16:03
say
16:04
you are healed okay the blood it helps
16:07
your mind and your mental faculties it
16:10
just does
16:11
physically mentally and emotionally it
16:14
can heal things and break things off of
16:16
you that never could be broken off
16:18
before
16:19
wow
16:20
that's my you know my spiritual father
16:22
wade taylor last five years of his life
16:24
he was my spiritual father he would take
16:27
communion every single day and i believe
16:29
he sometimes several times today his and
16:32
his he believed that the lord had shown
16:34
him that the closest thing we have you
16:36
know the tree of life isn't on the earth
16:38
right now he he strong
16:40
strongly believed that the taking
16:42
communion was the closest thing we had
16:44
to a tree of life on the earth as far as
16:47
the natural
16:48
you know elements that type of thing is
16:50
interesting you know and he was a very
16:51
healthy man until you know finally it
16:53
was his time and suddenly he was gone
16:55
but uh yeah that was i i've never looked
16:57
at communion the same since he since he
16:59
said that because i thought you know
17:01
that what if he's true
17:03
what if it's true that there's so much
17:05
more healing available to us
17:08
there is you know and i remember at
17:10
least i was in at the time that they had
17:12
just did it they were doing it again
17:13
just as a rope thing as a just a normal
17:16
thing they did once a month and god
17:19
yelled from heaven to me it is holy it
17:22
is holy it is holy
17:25
and i'm telling you the presence of god
17:27
fell so strong on me he said you will
17:29
say something about this and
17:32
so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh
17:35
one of the prophets visiting visiting
17:38
and uh
17:39
they read it to the congregation like a
17:41
week later they read it and the power of
17:43
god fell on the entire church and people
17:46
actually got on their knees and repented
17:49
for not taking it for the full uh the
17:51
power of god that was in it the fullness
17:54
of his sacrifices in there well what
17:56
what did he represent he represented
17:58
life hope joy
18:00
healing
18:01
empowerment that's what's in that's
18:04
what's in taking communion that's what
18:06
that means
18:07
that's profound i mean it's just so
18:09
profound yeah when i was raised up but
18:12
i'll get into these questions here when
18:13
i was raised
18:14
in a fundamental church it was like
18:16
every 13 weeks we had a communion they
18:19
even did the foot washing with it and
18:20
all that but it was like if we could
18:22
figure out a way to get out of that
18:24
particular
18:25
uh church service and stay home and once
18:28
in a while we'd figure out something
18:29
like let's go to the beach today it was
18:32
it was just a ritual there was no power
18:35
in it and we just looked for ways to get
18:37
out boy i would never do that
18:39
you know with my
18:40
understanding
18:42
it's very powerful here's
18:44
here's the first question um
18:46
this is a two-part i'll just read them
18:48
both but my mother was in her last days
18:50
in the hospital in hospice she kept
18:52
telling me about these beautiful atriums
18:55
she kept seeing i personally believe god
18:57
was showing her glimpses of heaven
18:59
before she passed so question when are
19:01
there
19:01
atriums in heaven and two does god
19:04
reveal heaven to people in their last
19:07
hours or moments to comfort them or to
19:09
prepare them before they die
19:11
um well that the last part is absolutely
19:14
true some people it's their first
19:17
glimpse of not just having
19:20
many people in their last maybe maybe
19:22
the last week especially they'll begin
19:24
to see family members who are in heaven
19:26
they'll just
19:27
see their faces or something sometimes
19:29
they might hear them say something
19:31
that's not like they're going to abide
19:32
there with them but he is letting them
19:35
have glimpses of having something else
19:37
they'll see many times are their own
19:39
angels
19:40
or or they'll just see angels in the
19:42
room that's really a clue that they're
19:44
probably not going to stay very long
19:46
and but if everything jesus christ
19:49
unless they walk up and he walks up to
19:50
him and say you know you will live and
19:53
not die or it's not your time but
19:55
sometimes he'll catch them up there and
19:57
tell them there and then send them back
19:59
but if if they begin to tell you that
20:01
i've seen jesus then that either means
20:04
they're going to be fully healed or
20:05
they're going to be fully healed by
20:06
going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of
20:09
that happens sometimes you'll give them
20:10
glimpses of mansions in heaven or the
20:12
streets of gold or even the throne
20:15
sometimes so that is absolutely that
20:17
part's absolutely true i think because
20:20
their spiritual body is getting more
20:22
aware
20:23
and um
20:24
even when it gets close to them stepping
20:26
out and they literally step out of their
20:28
body that's what they do if they're
20:30
sitting up naturally they'll just step
20:32
right out of their the physical body
20:34
it'll fall back but there they are right
20:36
there looking at their own body that's
20:38
happened to a lot of people and then
20:39
jesus would say it's not your time so
20:41
they have to go back in
20:42
wow there are many different things that
20:44
could happen some people were here
20:46
heavenly choir saying that part is very
20:48
true
20:49
and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about
20:51
something else in a minute about the
20:53
choirs but that is true and yes uh even
20:57
sometimes when people are really sick
20:59
maybe they're not terminal they will see
21:01
glimpses of places in heaven and i
21:03
believe the atrium thing that they're
21:04
seeing is probably some beautiful part
21:06
of the gardens of heaven uh there's a
21:09
friendly forest in heaven they have
21:11
beautiful gardens surrounding that
21:13
there's a butterfly there's like this
21:15
beautiful meadow where butterflies are
21:18
uh they actually will sing you hear them
21:20
singing so they could hear a heaven part
21:23
of heaven singing they could see angels
21:24
i could see family members there
21:26
and that does bring peace to them and
21:28
sometimes not just peace some people get
21:30
really excited when they when they have
21:32
glimpses of heaven like that that's
21:34
amazing well that's it's encouraging
21:36
because as i said the number of times my
21:38
mom's real close i'm kind of curious by
21:40
the way regarding that now my mom's
21:43
memory is going we just got back from
21:44
ohio she's got now she doesn't remember
21:47
from conversation to conversation
21:50
a few minutes late does god
21:53
let me ask it this way does god have a
21:54
harder time getting a hold of someone
21:56
like that who needs a little bit more of
21:58
him or does he have an easier time
22:00
because she's
22:02
tuned out of life what would that be
22:04
like
22:05
for her to maybe
22:07
i think it wouldn't matter what state
22:09
they're in mentally emotionally or
22:11
physically
22:13
when he wants to make himself known or
22:15
let them begin many times if we're
22:17
saying they feel no matter where they
22:19
are on their path if they belong to him
22:21
it he already has that connection with
22:24
them in their spirit
22:26
when he's ready to show them something
22:27
he's going to do it but normally that
22:29
will begin to change that person and
22:31
even if they can't remember what they
22:32
ate the day before who visit them the
22:34
day before they normally will not forget
22:36
if they begin to have encounters and
22:39
sometimes it's not like a face-to-face
22:41
encounter sometimes it's his presence uh
22:44
sometimes they they may say oh i feel
22:46
really good right now i i feel amazing i
22:49
feel such peace on me that's usually
22:51
because christ could be in that room
22:54
with them right there in that moment i
22:56
just know that sometimes it might be a
22:57
little bit easier in my thinking if your
23:00
natural mind begins to shut down or your
23:02
memory system the reason for that is
23:05
they can't remember the things that they
23:06
were angry about they can't remember
23:08
things
23:09
you know they can't remember their cares
23:11
they can't remember their concerns they
23:12
don't remember any things that were said
23:14
to them or maybe things that they did
23:16
that they shouldn't have you know maybe
23:18
unkind words that's gone from them so
23:21
that does totally open it up for the
23:24
lord to begin to either speak to them or
23:25
begin to show them things so this that
23:27
might be a good thing well you know it's
23:29
interesting you would say that i wasn't
23:30
going to share this but you know my
23:32
life's an open book right now but you
23:34
know
23:36
what what's that
23:39
you love it it's so open because every
23:40
millions are white i know well we went
23:43
out in march and i i was thinking i was
23:45
being a good dutiful
23:47
obedient loving son to offer her to come
23:51
and live with us from ohio and boy oh
23:53
heck broke liz and i understand this is
23:56
this is really what happens to a lot of
23:58
seniors at this age they if you think
24:03
if they're thinking you're taking their
24:04
blasted i mean she didn't say any bad
24:06
words but she was furious he was
24:09
okay so now fast forward we just can't
24:11
went out there in ohio and we were
24:14
itching her along
24:15
and then she called me after we we got
24:18
back and and
24:20
she's now she's inviting herself to live
24:22
with me instead of the other
24:24
i said i said well mom
24:27
you
24:27
you know after you treated me so
24:30
horribly and she goes what are you
24:31
talking about and she made me repeat it
24:33
five times and she didn't even remember
24:35
after five seconds after i told her she
24:37
said now tell me again what i did then
24:39
we found out later she doesn't even
24:41
remember any of us flying out there
24:43
during march
24:44
yeah that does that actually doesn't
24:48
happen as part of the process of just
24:50
being prepared many times just to just
24:53
to leave
24:54
um but that's normal and you're right
24:56
that's very normal
24:58
and
24:59
even most people when they of course if
25:01
they're still around here around a
25:02
heaven uh a hundred years old you you
25:05
should see some of them some of them are
25:06
sharp as attack but in the natural most
25:09
people's bodies and their systems and
25:11
the way they operate their thinking it
25:14
kind of begins to shut down some uh they
25:16
may be alert in every other way but
25:19
their memory from like the day before
25:21
whatever like she was saying to you that
25:23
might be god's blessing sometimes
25:25
because like you said she didn't
25:26
remember even saying that yeah it feels
25:28
like well i had i had actually been
25:31
again here's that open book thing i was
25:33
really wounded i was hurt and i kind of
25:36
cared that i kept forgetting her in my
25:37
heart all this time after i found out
25:40
yesterday that she has no recollection
25:43
i'm thinking what
25:45
what how what purpose would it be to
25:47
even have any hurt left what have i
25:49
heard about something that she has no
25:51
recollection of ever doing so it's like
25:53
it just fell off it just fell off
26:00
it's almost like
26:01
maybe a child does something not to hurt
26:03
you on purpose but it just happens you
26:05
know
26:06
and uh especially in the different
26:08
growing years they might say something
26:09
hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and
26:12
it it it's part of their growing the
26:15
young on the young side but when they're
26:18
older it's just part of what's natural
26:21
and i think that is i know people who've
26:23
forgotten that went through traumas and
26:25
stuff not not my family of other people
26:27
had horrible traumas when they got
26:29
closer to that age they didn't even
26:30
remember it it's like it just naturally
26:33
left them and they're happy i've also
26:36
known people who like almost couldn't
26:37
stand being around somebody and now they
26:40
love them it's the same
26:42
same people but but they really love
26:44
them because the person who was holding
26:46
that was gone because the memory part
26:48
was gone
26:49
so yes steve you can't you can't hold it
26:51
against somebody who to them like well
26:52
that never happened i would never say
26:54
that
26:55
they mean to you i never said that
26:58
yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't
27:00
you know i was
27:03
you were hurting that hurt
27:07
so anyway that's good all right here we
27:09
go
27:10
he goes i'm i'm finding out that my
27:12
seven-year-old son
27:13
is a seer what is your number one piece
27:15
of advice for a young seer for their
27:17
parents his sister has an autoimmune
27:20
issue and he said that once while we
27:21
were praying for her healing he looked
27:24
up and saw a small angel about four
27:26
inches tall
27:27
with wings wearing a red dress with her
27:29
hand on my daughter's foot praying for
27:32
her would that have been her guardian
27:34
angel that my son saw or a different one
27:37
sent for specific purpose so it's kind
27:39
of a multi-part there that probably
27:41
would be a different one sent for a
27:43
specific purpose but since you brought
27:44
that whole thing up
27:46
i i have known families who had a child
27:49
who was handicapped in some way
27:52
they get extra angels assigned to them
27:54
just because of that what we would call
27:57
a disability uh they get extra ones
27:59
assigned to them
28:00
and this young man now is so almost
28:03
absolutely normal he has some physical
28:05
things not causing him pain but growing
28:07
up they said he wouldn't live they said
28:09
he would never have a normal mind he
28:11
would never be able to talk never feed
28:13
himself and this was being fed to this
28:15
young child's parents like their whole
28:17
life they refused to accept that they
28:19
made sure he had everybody the care that
28:21
he had but they talked to him normal
28:24
they didn't treat him like there's
28:25
something wrong with him and he has two
28:28
angels that are with him all the time
28:29
besides his guardian angel and they're
28:31
there because of this this handicap
28:34
thing he has like i said this is like 30
28:36
years later and you know to see him he's
28:39
so filled with the light of god he's a
28:40
believer
28:42
and he's such a testimony to people
28:44
because of how he has grown in every way
28:46
that the doctor said he wouldn't be
28:47
alive but there were two angels assigned
28:50
to him and i knew somebody else who had
28:53
someone who was grown and they also had
28:56
two other angels and finally i just
28:57
asked holy spirit why are those other
28:59
angels with him
29:01
they looked different than from their
29:02
guardian angels and they said oh they're
29:04
sent to they they like protect the
29:07
anointing that they carry they're there
29:09
just to be uh yeah to bring things down
29:11
from heaven to them that god wants to
29:13
put into them i'm pretty certain that's
29:16
what that four inch angel was that was
29:18
like a little messenger angel bringing
29:20
something down they wouldn't be part of
29:22
the host but they probably were brought
29:24
down from heaven with one of the hosts
29:25
probably brought them down there so that
29:28
was great as far as being a seer
29:30
i would get a journal most important to
29:33
write down things that he's seeing it's
29:35
really important that they do that
29:38
when he gets older he'll be very
29:39
grateful for that journal uh like right
29:41
the day what he said he saw just write
29:44
in his words what he said
29:46
and then anytime he comes i've already
29:48
told some of my
29:50
my daughters to make sure that they do
29:51
that and so one of them has actually
29:53
started cataloging and now this child is
29:56
10
29:57
and he's not stopped seeing things but
29:59
it's very powerful to him that he can
30:01
read about the things he said that he
30:03
heard said or that he saw so definitely
30:07
most important thing you can do is uh no
30:09
matter what god ends up by doing with
30:10
that gift he has
30:12
it will be very powerful one day make
30:14
sure you're writing it down yeah and
30:16
what
30:16
what's the deal with the four inch angel
30:20
versus a seven foot angel i mean
30:22
what would you say about that
30:24
i would say
30:25
possibly whatever it is that the child
30:28
is um whatever it was you said that they
30:30
had it probably there may be like a
30:33
tribe of those little angels like that
30:35
made for that specific thing
30:38
that they were diagnosed with and that
30:40
maybe that may be something that god
30:42
sends maybe his life is in them they're
30:44
they're probably putting the life of god
30:46
in them oh the peace of god in them so
30:49
that would be their only assignment that
30:51
would be what they would be sent for
30:52
probably to keep that child in peace or
30:55
the presence of god yeah i guess the
30:57
issue was it was she just said it was an
30:58
autoimmune issue so she didn't say that
31:01
so
31:01
okay melanie asked how old does god look
31:05
how old would we perceive him to be in
31:07
earthly terms i've heard you describe
31:09
kind of seeing his face but i've also
31:11
heard you describe
31:12
almost a little bit of a veil so i mean
31:14
how do you see him you and i talked on
31:16
the cruise that one time and i said are
31:19
you telling me
31:21
cat that you're sitting down
31:23
sitting down talking face to face with
31:25
the god of the whole cosmos
31:28
and you just like yeah
31:32
you know
31:32
that should be crazy
31:34
it would be like
31:36
asking that question to a child
31:38
that really saw something let's say your
31:40
child went and saw somebody or met
31:42
somebody and you maybe try to convince
31:44
them i don't think you saw them they
31:45
would be so adamant
31:47
uh that the child like part of me
31:50
there's nothing in me that could make up
31:52
anything he wouldn't use me at all if he
31:54
if if i did that i i'm a detailed person
31:57
so i'm always going to see details one
32:00
of the reasons why i see him clearly is
32:02
he chose me because i have a
32:05
photographic memory and i am a detailed
32:07
person like i'm not going to hear just a
32:09
sentence that he says i i'm taking
32:12
places that i have to remember all that
32:14
i saw
32:15
and then they have to write that down if
32:16
it's things that god came and told me
32:18
personally and he said i want you to i
32:21
want you to share this with people then
32:22
i have to remember exactly what he said
32:25
it's not like it becomes um familiar in
32:28
any way i won't even use that term
32:30
because the power uh the power he
32:33
carries i'm sure he has to probably uh
32:36
maybe minimize that a little bit just
32:38
for me to be able to be around him i
32:40
probably i sometimes i feel like
32:42
when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's
32:43
just to be in his presence i feel like
32:45
i'm going to melt and go inside of him i
32:47
don't know how to yeah outs to explain
32:49
that the love that comes from him is so
32:52
powerful and it's it's not just what i
32:55
feel his appearance is
32:57
quite striking if i could say that
33:01
you feel life
33:02
coming from him because it did we all
33:05
lived there so it's like he's holding
33:07
everything in him all of time is in him
33:09
he didn't appear somewhere time came
33:11
from him
33:12
and i know i i love the one-liners he
33:14
tells me to tell people they get their
33:16
heads so undone they try to wrap their
33:18
head around it but most of these things
33:19
are spiritually um discerned
33:22
i would say in his normal appearance
33:25
because i've seen him like a certain way
33:27
many times then there's times i've seen
33:29
him with flames of fire with lightning
33:31
bolts shooting out of him when he's
33:33
walking against the darkness and stuff
33:35
like that his own appearance begins to
33:37
change it talks about the wrath of god
33:41
and any believer you should know this
33:43
that we are not appointed under that
33:45
wrath that he was demonstrating that
33:46
would be evil in darkness and wickedness
33:50
that he despises evil he despise what it
33:53
does to people so if he was gonna catch
33:55
me up there and talk about the justice
33:58
that is coming then his whole appearance
34:00
would be to bring justice that would
34:03
show me that that fierce side of him
34:05
okay
34:06
the loving father side of him which is
34:08
what i see many times
34:10
i know his hair is made out of light
34:12
remember the father is all spiritual but
34:15
he still has the ability to hold me if
34:17
he wants to
34:19
or i can just stand next to him i can
34:22
see into his eyes and usually they're
34:23
like blue flames of fire they're they
34:26
look blue to me blue flames of fire but
34:28
what comes out of him if you could
34:30
picture
34:31
um
34:32
i love the northern lights i've not seen
34:34
them in person but i've seen god
34:37
and that's what that rainbow looks like
34:38
coming out of him if you ever wondered
34:40
it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not
34:42
like you could just paint it around him
34:45
and it would just be there and not have
34:46
life and movement and i would have to
34:48
say seeing the northern lights in the
34:50
way that they move like this coming out
34:53
of him continually and on these
34:56
waves of his rainbow which he it comes
34:59
from him no man made the rainbow people
35:02
it comes from the living god it's part
35:03
of his own appearance and his person and
35:06
out of that comes these little spirits
35:08
of life they'll ride on this rainbow
35:09
then ride back in him that's what you
35:11
used to do when you lived inside god it
35:14
says in him we live we move we have our
35:18
very being the prophets and poets of old
35:20
have spoken of these things what things
35:22
when they were shown that
35:25
way in the past god would show himself
35:26
to people sometimes and sometimes it was
35:29
someone who was a poet and they actually
35:30
wrote poems about that
35:32
and so one of those made it in the word
35:34
of god so that's just a part of him to
35:37
see him like that the creative side
35:40
where i would see jesus step out of the
35:42
father and the father would say
35:44
something and then he would make what he
35:47
said that's why he was called the word
35:50
we know in the book of john it says that
35:53
we know in the book of john when john
35:54
said
35:56
the word was with god
35:59
and was god and there was nothing that
36:01
was made that was not made by him
36:04
that was jesus christ that's who he the
36:07
word came to the earth and died uh as
36:10
the son of god and so they're one and
36:13
the same the word jesus christ are the
36:15
same but when he was the word he only
36:17
had a spiritual body he was all spirit
36:20
it was still a body i know in your mind
36:22
you can't imagine you think of something
36:24
like a little like a spirit like
36:26
whatever you want to call it like the
36:28
spirit of a person or something they're
36:30
much more there's much more to them than
36:32
just some little wispy thing if you're
36:35
in a spirit world which heaven is and
36:38
everyone there in the spiritual body
36:40
they look solid in that world okay so
36:43
when i see the father most of the time
36:45
he looks like he's solid although he's
36:47
all spirit so i've seen him with love
36:50
coming out that consumes like the whole
36:52
army of god before they're going to go
36:54
somewhere um to bring justice for him
36:57
over someone on the earth he'll
36:59
literally go and just stand in their
37:00
midst and every one of them will be
37:03
permeated with his love he loves them
37:05
too
37:06
and his love and and just empowerment
37:09
and and when you see that he's he is
37:12
kind
37:13
and he is good and many people don't see
37:16
the father is good but jesus himself
37:18
said there's none good but the father
37:21
and so when you see there's many
37:23
different parts of him sides of him
37:25
uh that's who he is but
37:27
i i'm always undone
37:30
when he comes most of the time
37:32
unannounced
37:33
because what is on his heart to share
37:35
i'm i'm his revelator that's what he
37:37
calls me that means i reveal for him
37:41
i don't reveal for a man so i'm not
37:43
gonna usually i can answer questions ask
37:45
me if i've been told or shown it
37:47
otherwise i can't answer that i can't
37:49
answer for him if i haven't been shown
37:51
or told something
37:54
so it's really quite undone sometimes
37:56
the room i'm in like where i sleep which
37:59
is in my office built this moment
38:01
there's a huge portal in that room and
38:04
and sometimes he would come down through
38:06
that portal but sometimes most likely in
38:08
the hotel room a lot of times he'll just
38:10
walk through the wall like it's not
38:12
there and he'll begin to tell me stuff
38:14
sometimes he'll tell me to write it down
38:16
sometimes he'll write on the wall
38:18
and we know that even in the word of god
38:20
it talks about him doing these things so
38:22
for him
38:23
those are normal things he does when he
38:25
when he knows somebody who's going to
38:27
tell the truth who will not embellish on
38:29
what he
38:31
what he said which is extremely
38:33
significant even john the baptist had
38:36
one of the greatest revelations ever
38:37
given on the earth that's why they said
38:39
he's the greatest prophet of all that's
38:41
why that's in there he announced
38:43
literally
38:44
here is the son of god he actually got
38:47
to say that even though in the natural
38:48
he was jesus's cousin when he spoke
38:51
those words he wasn't speaking from a
38:53
natural viewpoint he was speaking from a
38:55
divine point and he never changed as
38:57
much as that he came that he came to say
39:00
that you had to repent of your sins
39:01
right he was one of the first ones to
39:03
give that message so what he said was so
39:06
powerful when he actually said here he
39:08
is
39:09
uh the the first and only person on the
39:11
earth who could actually say here's
39:13
jesus christ the son of the living god
39:15
this is the messiah that was a powerful
39:17
word but he never changed what he said
39:19
because that's what god told him to say
39:22
wow yeah and you've always been obedient
39:24
that way you know almost to a
39:26
frustrating point because people will
39:27
ask you something i've seen it even on
39:29
um
39:30
what's the kenneth copeland channel i
39:32
can't think of any victory channel or
39:33
whatever and flashpoint and they'll try
39:35
to get you to answer a question you'll
39:37
say i can only tell you what god told me
39:39
and then he'll launch into your
39:41
prophecy that was that's pretty i've
39:43
learned learned a good way um also
39:45
that's part of that same question is
39:47
does god the father does he look like a
39:50
grandpa does he look like a dad who's
39:52
older what what age
39:54
impression when he leaves well i know
39:56
you're wanting most people will judge
39:58
somebody by their skin
39:59
okay or conditioning is a skin and does
40:01
it have wrinkles does it not have
40:03
wrinkles does it have like brown spots
40:07
and most people judge people nor in the
40:10
natural you know um if they have white
40:12
hair no hair
40:14
i mean i i can't answer him in that
40:17
context i cannot put him in a category
40:20
as a human i know that i see life in him
40:23
i see still even now talking you can
40:26
still see his face
40:28
very clearly and it's filled with life
40:31
there's no age in him he's never going
40:34
to age his hair is white it's alive his
40:38
hair on his head is living it's not
40:40
short hair it's down below his shoulders
40:43
uh he has this amazing uh wonderful
40:46
beard
40:47
um
40:48
it just you know i can't i tell people
40:50
say what do you think he looks like
40:51
kenny rogers he doesn't look like a
40:53
human
40:56
everyone fails in comparison to him
40:59
because of the stuff he carries that
41:02
makes him who he is
41:04
but i can just say that you will you'll
41:06
never regret giving yourself to his son
41:09
that is the one where you are assured of
41:11
meeting him in person
41:13
he's excited about seeing you he cannot
41:15
wait for you to get back home to heaven
41:18
and i hope this gives you a glimpse of
41:20
the other side of dying for you you're
41:22
losing something for him he's gaining
41:24
something he's gaining his son or his
41:27
daughter back to himself he is so
41:30
excited all of heaven celebrates when
41:32
they come home so for them there's
41:35
there's there's no loss in their mind uh
41:38
from the time they step out of the
41:39
spiritual body they're stepping right
41:41
there they feel his presence they see
41:43
their angels their excitement floods
41:46
them you know i mean it's not like they
41:48
don't love you to actually love you even
41:49
more
41:50
but but just to be in his presence i
41:53
understand why jesus when he had to live
41:55
on the earth he'd go away to the
41:56
mountains to to be with his father he
41:58
would go away to go be that he needed it
42:00
after living here with humans are you
42:02
kidding
42:03
and so king himself
42:05
loves the father and i think for him the
42:08
greatest thing he gets to do is take us
42:10
back to him when you come home to heaven
42:12
he walks you up the steps of god's
42:15
throne the father's throne and gives you
42:18
back to him he says
42:20
your son your daughter they've come home
42:22
and let me tell you the celebration will
42:24
start in heaven at that time but but he
42:27
is not little he's not a little person
42:29
in any way whatsoever but this is what i
42:32
love about the father one of the
42:33
greatest things i like to say about him
42:35
is he could be a hundred feet tall two
42:37
thousand feet tall whatever he wants to
42:39
be he can be that size i think sitting
42:42
on the throne many times and to me he
42:44
would look like maybe i don't know 10 15
42:46
feet high he he doesn't want to make
42:48
himself invisible to you if you're
42:50
coming home to meet him but i've seen
42:52
him holding the earth in his hands so i
42:54
hope you get this picture i've seen him
42:57
back in time when he was making the
42:59
earth holding it in his hand this is the
43:02
father when the word would step out he'd
43:05
make it gave it to the father the father
43:07
began to speak over the earth itself
43:10
he would pour water from himself he's
43:12
going to put the water on the earth he
43:14
poured from his own south the river of
43:16
the river of life that comes from him he
43:19
poured that in as the ocean on the earth
43:23
and so whatever they did they did
43:24
together and so i've seen him that big
43:27
to hold the earth in his hand
43:32
i've seen him be you know make himself
43:36
well call enormous eyes just to hold you
43:38
he'll stand up on the throne and hold
43:39
you to himself
43:41
and i also know this about him that even
43:44
though he's on the throne
43:46
he himself can make himself
43:49
not leaving the throne
43:51
small enough to step inside of himself
43:54
to play with all the little spirits of
43:56
life that's who you were are you serious
43:59
with you in himself while he's sitting
44:02
on the throne people he knows what's
44:04
going on
44:06
if you think he's willing to give this
44:09
earth that he loved that he spoke over
44:12
to evil what do you think he didn't have
44:14
and he kicked it out it got unseated
44:18
lost his place lost his authority lost
44:21
his power
44:22
lucifer did you think he's changed his
44:25
mind about that because he has not
44:28
he loves you too much and this time is
44:32
too important for him to give it over to
44:34
evil all i know is they're going to lay
44:36
down roll over and beg god for mercy
44:40
when those days of justice fall upon
44:42
them and for some of them it will be too
44:45
late
44:47
wow wow catboy the anointing hit you
44:49
right there god came
44:51
god came down wow
44:53
wildcat
44:54
cat let me can i explore a little bit
44:56
you talk about the son loves the fat
44:58
father loves his son and son loves the
44:59
father i think we've talked about this a
45:01
little bit let me
45:03
drill down you know when i was raised up
45:04
we'd always make sure we pray in the
45:06
name of jesus make sure you say the name
45:08
of jesus and it became like a
45:10
a formulaic word make sure you mention
45:13
the name of jesus because then god can
45:15
has to do it but but is there something
45:18
in when we pray in the name of jesus
45:21
that we should at that moment
45:24
almost tap into how much the father
45:26
loves jesus
45:28
as we're saying that as opposed to just
45:30
making sure you pronounce jesus or
45:33
yeshua what
45:35
what is that go ahead and understand who
45:38
you're talking about when you use this
45:40
name
45:41
uh and if if there's probably if you're
45:44
saying it just from head knowledge this
45:46
is what you want to know don't ever say
45:48
his name from head knowledge
45:50
okay you need to say it from revelation
45:54
like what i just spoke okay that's how
45:57
you should feel every time you say his
45:59
name for any purpose you're having power
46:03
in that name of jesus that's why it is
46:05
one of your greatest weapons the name of
46:07
the name of christ okay his name his
46:10
blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of
46:14
who he is he right now he right now is
46:17
the king of glory people uh he has many
46:21
other titles besides jesus christ when
46:24
you talk about him as your savior and
46:26
what he did for you he also gave you
46:28
power over all the power of the enemy he
46:33
gave us three things you see him from
46:34
that viewpoint it should almost be like
46:38
a threat to hell that you are saying the
46:41
name of jesus christ
46:43
wow wow
46:45
yeah that's a whole lot different
46:47
well that's what the lord's been showing
46:48
me lately is is to tap into to that to
46:53
him to the reality
46:54
um
46:56
yeah and this one you kind of answered
46:58
this this is the next question but you
46:59
kind of addressed this
47:01
it says before jesus came to the earth
47:02
and he was called the word in heaven did
47:05
his spiritual body then look like
47:08
what we know as his human body or what
47:10
we think of as his human body or was his
47:12
body more like i don't know what i don't
47:14
know what this means was his body more
47:16
like the holy spirit i i think this
47:18
person's grasping between um
47:22
a cloud like the holy spirit or the body
47:24
of jesus but i i think they both have
47:27
um
47:28
a
47:29
spiritual butt right
47:32
yeah i would say when you are you
47:34
talking about let me get the timing
47:36
right are they talking about what jesus
47:37
looked like when he stepped out of his
47:39
physical body let me see when jesus came
47:41
to the earth and he was called the word
47:44
in heaven he was called the word did his
47:46
spiritual body then in heaven
47:50
look the same as his human body looked
47:52
on earth
47:54
oh when he was the word did it look the
47:56
same as the physical body on earth that
47:59
seemed to be the question no physical
48:00
body changed him from what he looked
48:03
like
48:05
because if it looked just like the word
48:07
why did not satan recognize him oh good
48:11
point oh good point he did not know when
48:14
he took him to the mountain temptation
48:15
that was the son of the living god he
48:18
didn't know that he was trying to find
48:19
out who he was
48:22
he was always pursuing who is he until
48:25
he himself said who he was he did not
48:28
know
48:29
he did not know he was the word that was
48:31
with god the word was all spiritual body
48:34
that was his divine body a spiritual
48:37
body a spiritual body like we were just
48:39
talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know
48:41
what they're talking about you're
48:43
talking about what they've seen on tv or
48:44
movies this little wispy thing steps out
48:46
they can go through walls and the reason
48:48
why uh your spiritual body down here
48:50
could walk through a wall is that
48:52
physical wall is a temporary substance
48:56
it's even a temporary realm the physical
48:59
realm is not the original realm the
49:01
spiritual realm where the whole world
49:03
called heaven was created where tribes
49:06
of angels were made where you go back
49:08
home to live in that place you don't
49:10
pass to the walls in heaven and your
49:12
spiritual body okay you have substance
49:15
in your spiritual body but as far as the
49:18
appearance thing the word was very
49:20
powerful he could go in and out wherever
49:23
he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he
49:25
had no flesh attached to him the other
49:28
sacrifice you don't realize he made was
49:31
he was willing not just to walk and live
49:34
in a physical body he had to keep the
49:36
physical body wow and so when your
49:39
little spirit person leaves god when you
49:42
lived in god you didn't look like
49:44
this okay you had a little appearance
49:47
you had a face you little face you had
49:48
body you could play inside of god and
49:50
the river of life climbed the mountain
49:51
that's in him a ride in and out on the
49:54
waves of the rainbow you could do those
49:56
things in your little spiritual body but
49:59
you didn't look
50:00
this gave you an identity okay that's
50:03
one of the reasons why he wanted you to
50:05
have a fleshly body number one so you
50:07
could live in this physical body in this
50:10
physical world and do things for him
50:12
here
50:13
but as opposed to the word the word look
50:16
different than jesus christ did because
50:19
the flesh wrapped around your spiritual
50:21
body
50:22
your spiritual body actually adapts to
50:26
the flesh
50:27
because when your throat man steps out
50:29
of this body when mine does
50:32
it looks the same as if i was in my
50:34
fleshly body except
50:37
i look a whole lot younger and so were
50:40
you one day so know that satan did not
50:43
recognize
50:45
who jesus christ was he didn't know he
50:47
was the word okay who made him actually
50:51
uh satan was created he's a created
50:53
being
50:54
he didn't know that that was the word he
50:56
didn't know at all
50:58
and that that was part of the bushwhack
51:00
people so that was part of the butch
51:02
whack that jesus would almost have a
51:04
disguise that satan wouldn't recognize
51:07
for a very long time jesus could do
51:09
things he wanted to say what he wanted
51:11
to and
51:12
and satan i'm sure was quite shocked
51:15
when jesus christ you know
51:17
living on the earth began to cast demons
51:20
out of things that really freaked him
51:21
out i'm really sure
51:23
now he said okay this person's got power
51:25
he's got power i i don't didn't know he
51:27
had this power uh
51:30
and he's not really as brilliant as he
51:32
wants people to think he is because when
51:34
he got kicked out the heaven part of his
51:35
mind was seared by that lightning bolt
51:38
i'm just letting you know so he did not
51:40
know that that jesus christ was the word
51:43
of god because jesus himself with his
51:46
fleshly body looked different than the
51:49
word and right now he still looks like
51:51
jesus christ who lived and walked on the
51:53
earth except for this
51:55
he has his glorified body already he was
51:58
glorified that body was glorified when
52:00
he stepped up from hell came up from
52:02
hell and stepped into that physical body
52:04
that was dead laying on that slab
52:07
life infused it but not just life but
52:09
the glory of god infused the body of
52:12
jesus christ and he walks around now in
52:13
his physical glorified body
52:16
in heaven so when he comes to see me
52:18
that's that's who i see is the one in
52:20
the glorified body and you know when you
52:22
said uh this is the first time it ever
52:24
clicked that we would have looked
52:26
different inside the father because we
52:28
would only look like we looked down
52:30
because i'm a combination of my mother
52:32
and my father that's
52:34
the appearance i took on
52:36
that's right because i had a natural
52:38
mother father so i don't look totally
52:40
different in heaven before god selected
52:42
the family for me i guess yes
52:45
he knew all along
52:47
he knew you would be looking like just
52:49
like you do now steve
52:51
he knew everybody would be looking like
52:52
that like they do right now in their
52:54
physical body he knew
52:56
when you were in him you were chosen
52:59
at that point for some things in your
53:01
life he put a little mark on you he knew
53:04
i would be a prophet he knew you would
53:06
make a home for the prophets to come and
53:08
say whatever god wanted to say he knew
53:10
that we probably knew each other we
53:12
probably were friends inside of him that
53:14
would be cool to know that would be
53:16
really interesting you think so we
53:18
wouldn't
53:18
be doing so because
53:20
i know
53:21
those who were friends inside of god if
53:23
he chose you to be a part of your
53:25
lifetime
53:27
uh in a significant way he would
53:30
absolutely choose people that kids that
53:32
you were like call them kids they all
53:34
little they're all little at all like a
53:36
bunch of little kids living in him and
53:38
and you had i would see little kids
53:40
sometimes with little groups playing
53:42
with each other and doing things with
53:43
each other and we we can have a whole
53:46
whole just segment about life and god uh
53:49
really that would be quite fascinating
53:51
to find out revelation about what did
53:53
you do in there what went on there what
53:54
does it look like and there's another
53:56
whole thing
53:57
but i'm pretty sure that we probably
53:59
were friends i know my husband and i
54:02
were friends when we were we were part
54:04
of this the little group that we had
54:06
uh inside god that we played there's
54:08
millions inside of him but
54:10
there's no back to god there's no size
54:13
to god it's like inside of him he's part
54:16
of infinity
54:17
and that at one time you know before he
54:19
made the earth we all everyone who ever
54:21
was or will be lived in him you can
54:24
imagine in your head let's hope you
54:26
maybe that makes you realize how
54:27
powerful he is about who he is uh he is
54:30
limitless in his understanding and his
54:32
knowledge and in his revelation he's
54:35
unlimited in almost every way he's
54:37
unlimited can i ask you a a difficult
54:41
question
54:42
that some watching will even um
54:45
it would be their question it would be
54:47
their question
54:49
god knew you before you were born he
54:51
knew what you would look like before you
54:52
were born and then there are people who
54:55
are product of of either
54:58
born out of wedlock in some cases rape
55:01
how do you what do you say to people who
55:03
say but what about me how could god have
55:05
known me
55:07
and allowed me to either have
55:10
children of abuse or
55:12
what do you say about the plan of god
55:14
and what
55:15
sometimes we're allowed to go through
55:17
in this life
55:19
i think one day
55:21
when you get your book given to you that
55:23
was written about you in heaven you'll
55:24
understand that he didn't choose any of
55:27
the evil stuff at all that wasn't had
55:29
nothing to do with god at all he sent us
55:31
to this earth it's an imperfect earth
55:33
there's imperfect people
55:35
everybody is held accountable for what
55:37
they did they they there there will be
55:39
an accountability uh of course when you
55:42
receive jesus christ that has something
55:44
to do with wiping that away
55:46
but i can tell you this he sent you this
55:48
is what happened he picked you for
55:50
certain things he sent you to earth at
55:53
the time he needed you to be here
55:56
he didn't choose those people to be
55:58
wicked they weren't always wicked when
55:59
they were children they weren't wicked
56:01
okay so everybody making their own
56:03
choices are raising their children
56:06
in a certain way because of what's in
56:08
them
56:09
and that's why i always i talk to young
56:11
people a lot i've done young people
56:13
meetings and i say you have to
56:14
understand that you're not just going to
56:17
be raising children one day you are
56:19
shaping souls
56:21
that came from god for his use do not be
56:24
abusive i'm i'm telling them this
56:26
already but you know what that's if they
56:28
watch a lot of violent stuff
56:30
just go into their soul and even
56:32
psychiatrists know this they don't
56:34
understand the workings of the soul or
56:36
what the soul looks like but what you
56:38
what you choose what you listen to all
56:41
the time will become a part of you what
56:43
you watch all the time would become a
56:44
part of me and eventually you might even
56:46
act out some of those things you see
56:49
and that's why there's evil satan helps
56:51
that to happen he makes sure it happen
56:54
happens and yet there's some people who
56:56
grew up in a violent household
56:59
that that never part part took of that
57:01
they they were strong they never allowed
57:03
that to affect their life or how they
57:06
lived it later and became and were
57:08
totally totally different people than
57:10
what that person was that had them so
57:12
you have to understand god didn't create
57:15
he didn't make evil happen
57:17
he didn't even make lucifer satan
57:20
if you go back that far let's go that
57:22
far he may lucifer to be an anointed
57:25
being who would help lead worship
57:27
for him to create glory for him to be a
57:30
light for him that's what that's what
57:33
lucifer's job was he made him for that
57:36
he didn't make him to be evil it says in
57:38
the bible iniquity was found in him
57:42
that was significantly because god
57:44
didn't put that in him
57:46
okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's
57:49
own thoughts and own
57:50
wicked desires to be greater than god
57:53
and want to rule
57:55
from that came evil began to be birthed
57:58
inside of him before it came out so
58:00
because there is evil
58:03
present in this world one day there
58:05
won't be any
58:07
we can look at it that way but god
58:09
didn't choose you to be tormented he
58:12
didn't choose that those people who
58:15
raised you had every right to choose to
58:17
do what was right regardless of what
58:19
within them they had every right to be
58:22
kind to you to nourish you
58:24
to nurture you and everything and know
58:26
god and no happiness and joy
58:29
and not have your mind tormented later
58:31
in your life all the things that
58:32
happened to you as a child but god
58:33
didn't create evil
58:35
in this earth
58:37
he didn't know evil would be here but he
58:40
also sent his son for the very purpose
58:42
that you could be free from anything
58:44
you went through you can be free from
58:46
any event no matter how bad it was or
58:48
when it happened you don't have to carry
58:50
that stuff on the inside of you
58:52
and that's why he came to bring freedom
58:54
in life he had an appointed time to be
58:57
here even jesus christ had to be made
59:00
into a seed this is what it says christ
59:03
was made into a seed he was made okay he
59:06
had he was going to have flesh on him
59:08
and i think on my our next um report we
59:11
do i'll actually read the poem holy
59:13
spirit gave me
59:14
about when the announcements began to
59:16
made it be made in heaven that the word
59:18
would die for us that the word would be
59:20
made flesh which it says in the bible
59:24
he was planted as a seed in the womb of
59:26
mary but there's this whole beautiful
59:28
story
59:29
it's called the year before christmas
59:32
and what literally began to happen in
59:34
heaven um you know before he was even
59:36
sent
59:37
and i'm not going to do that today but
59:39
we'll do that next week but you have to
59:41
understand god has been from the
59:42
beginning to the end and no matter what
59:44
you thought you could do that would be
59:46
better
59:48
he
59:49
has a plan
59:51
he was willing to sacrifice his own son
59:53
who was tormented and tortured and so
59:56
horribly abused wrongfully accused uh
59:59
you know unjustly treated
60:02
and and basically murdered
60:05
he knew that
60:06
his son would go through that but what
60:08
comes from that and this is the thing
60:11
you even though it's not god's intention
60:13
to make you suffer for him his son
60:16
suffered for all of us
60:18
you can take your life no matter what
60:20
you've been through and you can lose all
60:21
of that all of that horror all of that
60:23
abuse all that torment all that trauma
60:26
lucifer from your soul in jesus name and
60:28
jesus will come pull it out of you
60:30
and it will be like it didn't happen in
60:33
other words you might think about it but
60:34
there'll be no torment in it there'll be
60:36
no suffering in it
60:38
because we can be totally free
60:41
from all of the effects of evil but god
60:43
didn't make people bad he didn't make
60:46
evil itself
60:48
and the evil one who's done this will be
60:51
more tormented than anything that ever
60:53
existed throughout all the time he satan
60:57
will be more tormented than any other
60:59
anyone else who ends up in that lake of
61:01
fire
61:02
satan will be the most hated being in
61:04
there the most tormented and he will
61:06
have no
61:08
power whatsoever so you can think of
61:11
it's one thing you to be in a place of
61:14
torment but when you everyone is
61:16
tormenting that one person and they
61:17
can't escape or get away uh that is his
61:20
end he will have nothing from anything
61:23
he's done god also knows that he's a
61:26
just god
61:27
and kind loving god so you need to see
61:30
him the kind loving one who gave the
61:32
greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying
61:35
to cover up things that were done to you
61:37
my parents didn't torment me uh but i
61:40
certainly was picked on and and made fun
61:42
of most of my life growing up and i just
61:45
had to let it go i don't even know about
61:46
losing you know i decided i'm going to
61:47
let it go and go on i have stuff i have
61:50
to do and i want to see done
61:54
you have to make the same decision but
61:55
let me tell you god does know everything
61:58
and he is not it is seedtime and harvest
62:01
people this is not
62:03
don't get your 50 bottles of anointing
62:05
oil out okay because this is not the end
62:08
time harvest it talks about in the bible
62:10
before all the other stuff start to
62:12
happen we're not even ready to handle
62:14
that harvest like that okay you're going
62:16
to be powerful you're going to be filled
62:18
with god when those days come but it's a
62:21
seedtime and harvest for what you've
62:23
been planting what the left has been
62:25
planting harvest for them is about to
62:28
happen what you've been planting by
62:30
yours making a stand still filled with
62:33
life encouraging people bringing people
62:35
hope you're going to get the greatest
62:36
harvest you've seen in your life so far
62:39
this is the seedtime and harvest is
62:40
happening now just that's for free what
62:43
time is it time and harvest for us
62:46
individually for whole groups of people
62:48
if it's evil you're going to get a
62:50
harvest of justice and and probably the
62:53
rather that and
62:54
while
62:55
while you're talking
62:57
as this as we close out i know i feel
62:59
like there's some people out there that
63:00
says i wish someone would just show me
63:03
right now how to get saved i i like this
63:06
stuff
63:07
no one's ever led me to the lord how do
63:09
i do that would you
63:11
i sure would love to do that yeah
63:14
and and let me tell you it's really
63:16
uh man can come
63:18
complicate things so much sometimes we
63:21
feel like we don't read you know the the
63:23
50-page syllabus
63:25
or if we don't have someone who's like
63:27
known god forever lead you even a child
63:30
can lead someone to be born again you
63:32
make a decision in your own self that
63:35
you want jesus christ okay
63:37
you're tired of what you've been living
63:39
in you're tired of the junk going on in
63:40
this world you see no hope if you don't
63:43
have hope right now
63:44
you may not have a lot of god in you
63:47
because right now he's releasing hope in
63:49
life when you are born again
63:52
literally your your soul gets a shower
63:55
of the blood of jesus christ to wipe
63:57
away every sin you've ever committed no
64:00
matter what it is when it happened in
64:03
your life if you want to walk as
64:05
righteous if you don't have jesus christ
64:07
you're unrighteous okay you're not
64:08
counted as righteous if you want to be
64:10
counted as righteous you're going to be
64:12
part of god's plan what he has in this
64:14
earth you need to know his son jesus
64:16
christ
64:17
you first of all recognize that jesus
64:19
christ is the son of the living god he
64:22
did die for your sins and he did it
64:24
purposefully he chose to do that so the
64:27
first thing you do is repent of any sin
64:29
you've ever committed no matter when it
64:31
happened or how that happened re repent
64:34
recognize that you are a sinner and you
64:36
repent and you receive jesus christ as
64:38
your savior that's the first step that
64:41
you do that the second step is you thank
64:44
him for dying for you thank him for your
64:46
sins being forgiven and it will be like
64:50
in god's books in heaven when you
64:52
receive christ he literally will go and
64:54
wipe out in his books every sin up to
64:58
that point every one you've ever
64:59
committed will be wiped off like you
65:01
never did them that's how powerful the
65:04
blood of christ is
65:06
then you say i receive everything that
65:08
that blood affords me i receive
65:09
everything that that sacrifice that
65:12
affords me i realize now i'm part of
65:14
god's family i'm a part of his family
65:17
i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free
65:20
by grace you are a powerful born again
65:24
uh believer now jesus christ will
65:26
literally step inside of you that's what
65:28
happens he'll step inside of you
65:31
it says you invite him to live in you
65:33
and he will and then you begin to feel
65:36
his presence
65:38
miraculous things will begin to happen
65:39
because now you're carrying his presence
65:42
with you and anytime temptation comes to
65:44
you after that make sure you say no i'm
65:46
not that person anymore it says you're
65:49
born again you are a new creation and
65:52
the reason why god can say that is none
65:54
of your past sins you're not being
65:56
looked at anymore by a sinful person
65:59
you're being looked at as god's son or
66:01
his daughter whichever one he made you
66:04
and now he opens doors for you to
66:07
understand him more make sure you get a
66:08
bible i would encourage you to start
66:11
reading the new testament read the book
66:12
of john and make sure you study the book
66:14
of john as a lot about who jesus was
66:17
also talks about what what it's like to
66:19
be born again and in in there it's real
66:22
exciting and then make sure you speak to
66:24
him you need to know that prayer is very
66:27
important for you you don't just get you
66:28
know born again and now i'm saved and
66:31
live your life like he always lived it
66:33
i'm not saying you can't stay at the
66:34
same job or live in the same home you'll
66:36
have the same family but you need to
66:38
recognize now you're a new creation made
66:41
by god because of the blood of christ
66:43
you begin to seek him and what does that
66:45
mean get in a room by yourself and say
66:47
jesus christ i want to know you more i
66:49
want i want to know you i want to know
66:51
what your heart is i want to know what
66:53
your thoughts are of me and i would say
66:55
i i used to do it at one point every day
66:57
of my life i did that usually late at
66:59
night i'm not saying you have to do
67:00
anything late at night and this is the
67:02
thing some people say you have to take a
67:04
certain posture it's okay if you want to
67:06
kneel to do it you can be walking down
67:08
the street and get born again you can
67:10
get born again arriving in your car he's
67:12
looking to know you more he is seeking
67:15
you harder than you are seeking him
67:19
so the most important thing in your life
67:21
should be to receive christ and then
67:23
begin to pursue to know him more and
67:26
then you start on a whole different
67:29
journey
67:30
in your life the inside of you has
67:32
changed your spirit man god puts light
67:34
in your spirit your spirit man has light
67:37
in it it gives it more understanding it
67:39
gives you more of his presence inside of
67:41
you
67:42
your name is literally written in the
67:44
lamb's book of life he'll write it right
67:46
there at that moment that you get born
67:48
again and so powerful things happen in
67:50
the spirit when you are born again so i
67:53
would just say just you can say a simple
67:54
prayer so let's just say this you can
67:56
say
67:57
jesus christ
67:59
jesus christ
68:01
i want to receive you as my savior i
68:04
want to receive you as my savior
68:06
i recognize
68:08
we recognize
68:10
you are the son of the living god you
68:13
are the son of the living god
68:15
you came to this world to die for my
68:18
sins you came to this world to die for
68:20
my sins
68:21
so i repent of all sin so i repent of
68:24
all sin
68:26
up to this moment in my life up to this
68:28
moment in my life
68:30
i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to
68:33
wash me clean
68:35
with your blood with your blood
68:38
i receive your sacrifice i receive your
68:41
sacrifice
68:43
and i now thank you and i now thank you
68:46
for making me part of the family of god
68:49
for making me part of the family of god
68:52
i give you permission i give you
68:54
