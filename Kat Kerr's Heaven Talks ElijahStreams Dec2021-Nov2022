the way uh i'm i'm going to say this
01:52
before i forget to make the announcement
01:53

01:55
might forget if i don't say it
01:57
you know we have cats we have questions
01:59
for cat already for today so we don't
02:01
need those uh our staff decided it would
02:03
be great to have you ask any and all
02:05
kinds of questions about christmas
02:08
as it relates to heaven or whatever cat
02:10
knows is seeing understands so ask your
02:13
questions about christmas for next
02:15
week's broadcast most of the
02:18
people put those questions underneath
02:21
the youtube not in the chat to the right
02:22
but underneath uh where you put your
02:24
comments where they stay there not the
02:26
ones that just disappear and roll off
02:28
the screen
02:29
um and there are other ways we get them
02:31
too some people have hit reply and do
02:33
different things that our preferred
02:35
method is below youtube um and we'll try
02:38
and look at other places as well but
02:39
that's we're going to tell you that
02:40
specific one so i want to thank
02:42
everybody for your amazing donations
02:45
yesterday we pretty much had an
02:47
unprecedented number of donations and we
02:49
really appreciate that this ministry is
02:51
really growing by leaps and bounds uh
02:54
after the first we've got several more
02:55
people we'll be bringing on board in
02:57
fact we'll make those announcements at
02:59
the right time just a few of those
03:01
we will announce like this
03:04
i think that some of you have seen
03:05
illumination who now works for us we we
03:08
got her by making the announcement on
03:10
the
03:11
air so we will be making some
03:12
announcements
03:13
uh either next week or after the first
03:15
i'll see what the staff wants to do and
03:17
then people can then begin to send those
03:19
in so we'll figure out how to do that
03:21
and give you an address
03:23
or email whatever the staff wants and
03:25
we'll tell you which positions we're
03:26
looking for so
03:28
but anyway thank you very much for your
03:29
generosity i know it's the as you we
03:32
approach the year end many of you are
03:34
trying to to determine what you want to
03:36
do with your what things you want to do
03:38
with your um final giving for the year
03:40
we certainly appreciate you thinking
03:42
about us you know i've said that we've
03:44
built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda
03:46
and and then we've doubled the size we
03:48
paid for the construction of doubling
03:51
the size of the health clinic
03:53
on in that ugandan village i haven't
03:54
even shown you that picture yet uh we
03:57
have to work we're committed to do 24 to
03:59
dig 24 new wells in and around that
04:02
community and region and some of you who
04:05
saw that video we'll show it several
04:06
more times you saw that the people were
04:09
drinking
04:10
some of them when the water is running
04:12
off of the piglet tree into the water
04:14
that they they put in their drinking
04:15
water and they bring it home it's just a
04:17
horrific thing so we're digging
04:19
freshwater wells thank you so much for
04:21
your i i would say your help you know
04:24
it's not just you helped us you did it
04:26

05:46
next week you probably heard that and we
05:49

05:51
you talked about christmas town all that
05:52
so i'll have you just kind of elaborate
05:54
on that next week so well
05:57
yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll
06:00
just jump in um before we have any
06:02
questions cat what kind of anything
06:04
current events you'd like to share
06:07
uh
06:08
well i do there are there are things out
06:10
there everybody knows about and things
06:12
people can't know about right now but i
06:14
i can continue to tell you that that
06:17
foundation of the left is crumbling
06:20
um there's other people leaving their
06:22
positions because they're being exposed
06:25
in that is privately
06:27
that i can't announce who that is but
06:30
that big support this is the thing when
06:33
you lose your support like you were
06:35
saying you can't do anything that is
06:36
absolutely true but guess what it's also
06:38
true for the left
06:40
all the people who are jumping on that
06:42
bandwagon are jumping off many of them
06:45
are jumping off some of those are really
06:47
big supporters and i can tell you bottom
06:50
line why i can tell you why they want to
06:52
have money left over
06:54
because they keep being asked for more
06:56
and more and more you can't give
06:57
yourself to something that is totally
07:00
darkness and think they're going to let
07:03
you go how about if i give you that as a
07:05
tip
07:05
you can't do it you can run in
07:07
and agree and participate with things
07:10
that are evil
07:11
and think that will let you go
07:14
i can also tell a story about that there
07:17
are people who were part of an extreme
07:19
dark uh uh thing that was going on this
07:22
is probably maybe 15 years ago
07:24
and they actually had seen demons talk
07:27
to demons and not trying to scare
07:28
anybody they gave permission
07:31
they gave permission and they thought
07:33
what they got to do was exciting and
07:35
amazing but guess what they wouldn't let
07:37
them go they tormented them for the next
07:40
10 years of their life
07:42
and and they just couldn't get rid of
07:44
they didn't get rid of them because you
07:46
can't give yourself to something it's
07:49
like what god says what you enter into
07:52
will enter into you and that's how
07:54
simply something that's one liners of
07:56
some of the most powerful things he ever
07:58
says to me but what you choose to enter
08:00
into will enter into your soul that's
08:02
just what happens and either you think
08:04
about it you want to run after it or
08:06
else you give them a tie to you and
08:08
these people actually gave a tie
08:11
to to this these beings that were um
08:14
beginning to torment them when they were
08:16
done with the fun thing they thought
08:17
they were going to be a part of which
08:18
was dark was really bad i'm not going to
08:20
tell you what that was but they couldn't
08:22
get rid of them finally they had to
08:24
repent
08:25
and and cleanse their soul and every
08:28
every place they lived they had a place
08:30
that the demons would always come in at
08:31
night and torment him they couldn't do
08:33
anything about it
08:34
so they had somebody get hold of me
08:37
i didn't meet with them i told them what
08:39
they would have to do and they could
08:40
never ever go to that place again
08:43
and they would have to just you know
08:45
make sure that they
08:46
got that out of their soul number one
08:48
but they actually had to renounce
08:50
anything or any hold or tie that
08:53
darkness have with them that they gave
08:55
permission to that's the difference and
08:58
people who are just maybe attacked every
09:00
now and then that's it that's illegal
09:02
that's taken to the course of heaven
09:04
sometimes and sometimes god just comes
09:06
in supernaturally and ends that that's
09:09
like an attack this is not what these
09:11
people were doing they willingly
09:13
participated in these evil acts that
09:15
were happening somewhere and that's why
09:18
it took longer to get rid of it they
09:21
finally broke it they have had no no
09:24
nothing else come they stopped coming
09:26
they severed that tie they severed that
09:29
portal that was open by their own
09:31
repentance and then um having to take
09:33
communion over the whole thing and you
09:35
know what they attempted to come back
09:37
but they said they couldn't they served
09:38
only the living god they would not serve
09:41
the enemy again so that's why it's so
09:44
important to make sure you never get
09:46
into one of those places or participate
09:48
like that it's really hard to get rid of
09:50
and that's what people are finding out
09:52
now
09:52
who already have been a part of this
09:54
thing this year and a half long thing
09:56
that's been going on in our country
09:58
more and more people think i can make
10:00
money if i let them use me for this or
10:02
if i lie about this or if i cheat in
10:05
this way i'll make money well they're
10:07
finding out they're losing their money
10:08
that's what's happening they're losing
10:10
their money and once they make a tie or
10:13
a contract with this darkness that's
10:15
going on they won't let you go that's
10:18
why you don't want to participate in the
10:19
beginning you stand strong against
10:21
everything that's going on you keep
10:23
running after god right now in your life
10:26
and don't forget to celebrate he's still
10:28
saying that to me god has already seen
10:30
the beginning to the end he knows
10:32
exactly what will happen and i know
10:34
there's a lot of theories and
10:36
assumptions and people think they know
10:37
what's going to happen i can tell you
10:39
god is going to decide when that does
10:41
happen when it does it will be so great
10:43
you won't have to wonder if you'll hear
10:45
about it so this is just a tip to people
10:47
or those who are still in the darkness
10:49
you better get out while you can if you
10:52
don't you probably will lose everything
10:54
because this is an evil thing happening
10:56
in our country you cannot steal a
10:57
country you cannot give yourself to
10:59
satan or his evil ex and think he will
11:03
let go of you if you're already stepping
11:05
outside of that maybe you never got born
11:07
again you better get bored again really
11:09
quick
11:10
i will say that you better get born
11:11
again because that's probably the one
11:13
thing that can save you from all the
11:15
stuff you've been involved in but
11:17
there's already people they've already
11:18
got some people who are being witnesses
11:20
um to a lot of these accounts that
11:22
excuse me that are happening so i would
11:24
just encourage you and i'm gonna keep
11:26
doing it get out of that darkness while
11:28
you can
11:29
repent make sure you make sure you tell
11:32
somebody who is accountable
11:34
who is an authority in the area that's
11:37
just looking to see what's going on so i
11:40
just want to encourage people those
11:41
things are happening right now people
11:44
are uh they're distancing themselves
11:46
from some people they're actually
11:48
getting out of these things themselves
11:50
but people who have money are finding
11:53
that if something doesn't happen to stop
11:55
this whole thing they themselves will
11:58
have no money or property so let me tell
12:01
you evil will never bless you evil can't
12:04
create life or hope or something that's
12:06
going to help there is no help in evil
12:09
and darkness that comes from god that
12:11
comes from belonging to jesus christ so
12:14
all you who've been out there have been
12:15
strong and stayed strong and given hope
12:18
to people that that god does know what's
12:20
going on don't give up okay you got to
12:22
stay strong it says making your stand
12:24
and standing there for us i just want to
12:26
applaud you
12:28
yeah yeah
12:29
making a great stand for jesus christ
12:33
he made everything we know and see
12:36
nothing is hidden from him so if you
12:38
think because god's not saying anything
12:41
right now to everybody that does not
12:44
mean he doesn't he does have a plan he
12:46
he does he does have a plan for all of
12:48
this that's good ken i think you said
12:50
something a minute ago and i thought you
12:51
know i'm going to ask her to expound on
12:53
that you said people had sold out to
12:55
darkness and you got them into
12:57
repentance and to receiving the lord if
12:59
they hadn't but then you said
13:01
they took communion over that thing or
13:04
something to the that effect and you're
13:06
you're speaking about communion as if
13:08
it's a weapon
13:10
and let me just
13:11
ask you to expand uh expound on the
13:14
weapon of communion what does that
13:16
actually do
13:17
when people take communion
13:19
it is so powerful and
13:22
unfortunately most churches has just
13:24
become a tradition yeah
13:26
i will give you a good example of that i
13:29
remember
13:30
where i was attending at one time it had
13:32
become like a tradition
13:34
that doesn't make god very happy because
13:37
there is power in the blood of jesus
13:39
christ and his surrender totally to the
13:42
father's will and even his own
13:44
willingness to do he didn't have to do
13:47
anything at the cross and no matter what
13:49
people think don't take the crosses off
13:51
your wall now that you think he's not on
13:52
it anymore his own personal mark he
13:55
makes as a carpenter is a cross that's
13:58
what he does even in heaven when he
13:59
makes things that is significant
14:02
it means everything to all those who are
14:04
a believer who have received the the
14:07
sacrifice that christ did and died for
14:09
us he shed his own blood for us that is
14:11
a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks
14:14
things sometimes that nothing else can
14:18
and especially people if they've had
14:20
things going on in their house at night
14:22
maybe they may be familiar spirits or
14:24
other kind of spirits if there's nothing
14:26
else you can do you've prayed maybe
14:28
you've fasted you need to take communion
14:31
yourself over your property and then you
14:33
go outside and you pour some on the land
14:36
and say with the blood of jesus christ i
14:38
redeem this land a shockwave
14:41
of jesus christ will it tell you it will
14:44
embed itself in the property you're
14:46
living on and then you invite holy
14:49
spirit to invade it just invite the
14:51
spirit of god to invade it and let me
14:53
tell you what it'll be hard for anything
14:55
spiritually bad or evil to come on that
14:58
property it would be too painful for
15:00
them
15:00
taking communion is something some
15:03
people actually do every day
15:04
and i do it about once a month myself at
15:07
least sometimes more than that
15:10
and recently we just cleansed our land
15:12
again and let me tell you what the peace
15:15
of god with the presence of god will
15:17
infuse that the presence of god is in
15:19
communion
15:21
it represents many things it represents
15:23
the sec
15:25
reminds us of the sacrifice christ did
15:28
but it's something that brings us
15:30
together if you do that with your family
15:33
it will be so powerful in the spirit it
15:35
brings a bond with you and your family
15:38
together when you take that together
15:40
recognizing together as a family what
15:42
christ did for you
15:44
sometimes it opens things you never
15:46
could get open sometimes it breaks the
15:48
power of the enemy that nothing else
15:50
will break i even tell people who've
15:52
been sick for a long time you should be
15:54
taking communion over your body it says
15:57
very clearly in the bible what you know
16:00
what he did by his stripes what does it
16:03
say
16:04
you are healed okay the blood it helps
16:07
your mind and your mental faculties it
16:10
just does
16:11
physically mentally and emotionally it
16:14
can heal things and break things off of
16:16
you that never could be broken off
16:18
before
16:19
wow
16:20
that's my you know my spiritual father
16:22
wade taylor last five years of his life
16:24
he was my spiritual father he would take
16:27
communion every single day and i believe
16:29
he sometimes several times today his and
16:32
his he believed that the lord had shown
16:34
him that the closest thing we have you
16:36
know the tree of life isn't on the earth
16:38
right now he he strong
16:40
strongly believed that the taking
16:42
communion was the closest thing we had
16:44
to a tree of life on the earth as far as
16:47
the natural
16:48
you know elements that type of thing is
16:50
interesting you know and he was a very
16:51
healthy man until you know finally it
16:53
was his time and suddenly he was gone
16:55
but uh yeah that was i i've never looked
16:57
at communion the same since he since he
16:59
said that because i thought you know
17:01
that what if he's true
17:03
what if it's true that there's so much
17:05
more healing available to us
17:08
there is you know and i remember at
17:10
least i was in at the time that they had
17:12
just did it they were doing it again
17:13
just as a rope thing as a just a normal
17:16
thing they did once a month and god
17:19
yelled from heaven to me it is holy it
17:22
is holy it is holy
17:25
and i'm telling you the presence of god
17:27
fell so strong on me he said you will
17:29
say something about this and
17:32
so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh
17:35
one of the prophets visiting visiting
17:38
and uh
17:39
they read it to the congregation like a
17:41
week later they read it and the power of
17:43
god fell on the entire church and people
17:46
actually got on their knees and repented
17:49
for not taking it for the full uh the
17:51
power of god that was in it the fullness
17:54
of his sacrifices in there well what
17:56
what did he represent he represented
17:58
life hope joy
18:00
healing
18:01
empowerment that's what's in that's
18:04
what's in taking communion that's what
18:06
that means
18:07
that's profound i mean it's just so
18:09
profound yeah when i was raised up but
18:12
i'll get into these questions here when
18:13
i was raised
18:14
in a fundamental church it was like
18:16
every 13 weeks we had a communion they
18:19
even did the foot washing with it and
18:20
all that but it was like if we could
18:22
figure out a way to get out of that
18:24
particular
18:25
uh church service and stay home and once
18:28
in a while we'd figure out something
18:29
like let's go to the beach today it was
18:32
it was just a ritual there was no power
18:35
in it and we just looked for ways to get
18:37
out boy i would never do that
18:39
you know with my
18:40
understanding
18:42
it's very powerful here's
18:44
here's the first question um
18:46
this is a two-part i'll just read them
18:48
both but my mother was in her last days
18:50
in the hospital in hospice she kept
18:52
telling me about these beautiful atriums
18:55
she kept seeing i personally believe god
18:57
was showing her glimpses of heaven
18:59
before she passed so question when are
19:01
there
19:01
atriums in heaven and two does god
19:04
reveal heaven to people in their last
19:07
hours or moments to comfort them or to
19:09
prepare them before they die
19:11
um well that the last part is absolutely
19:14
true some people it's their first
19:17
glimpse of not just having
19:20
many people in their last maybe maybe
19:22
the last week especially they'll begin
19:24
to see family members who are in heaven
19:26
they'll just
19:27
see their faces or something sometimes
19:29
they might hear them say something
19:31
that's not like they're going to abide
19:32
there with them but he is letting them
19:35
have glimpses of having something else
19:37
they'll see many times are their own
19:39
angels
19:40
or or they'll just see angels in the
19:42
room that's really a clue that they're
19:44
probably not going to stay very long
19:46
and but if everything jesus christ
19:49
unless they walk up and he walks up to
19:50
him and say you know you will live and
19:53
not die or it's not your time but
19:55
sometimes he'll catch them up there and
19:57
tell them there and then send them back
19:59
but if if they begin to tell you that
20:01
i've seen jesus then that either means
20:04
they're going to be fully healed or
20:05
they're going to be fully healed by
20:06
going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of
20:09
that happens sometimes you'll give them
20:10
glimpses of mansions in heaven or the
20:12
streets of gold or even the throne
20:15
sometimes so that is absolutely that
20:17
part's absolutely true i think because
20:20
their spiritual body is getting more
20:22
aware
20:23
and um
20:24
even when it gets close to them stepping
20:26
out and they literally step out of their
20:28
body that's what they do if they're
20:30
sitting up naturally they'll just step
20:32
right out of their the physical body
20:34
it'll fall back but there they are right
20:36
there looking at their own body that's
20:38
happened to a lot of people and then
20:39
jesus would say it's not your time so
20:41
they have to go back in
20:42
wow there are many different things that
20:44
could happen some people were here
20:46
heavenly choir saying that part is very
20:48
true
20:49
and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about
20:51
something else in a minute about the
20:53
choirs but that is true and yes uh even
20:57
sometimes when people are really sick
20:59
maybe they're not terminal they will see
21:01
glimpses of places in heaven and i
21:03
believe the atrium thing that they're
21:04
seeing is probably some beautiful part
21:06
of the gardens of heaven uh there's a
21:09
friendly forest in heaven they have
21:11
beautiful gardens surrounding that
21:13
there's a butterfly there's like this
21:15
beautiful meadow where butterflies are
21:18
uh they actually will sing you hear them
21:20
singing so they could hear a heaven part
21:23
of heaven singing they could see angels
21:24
i could see family members there
21:26
and that does bring peace to them and
21:28
sometimes not just peace some people get
21:30
really excited when they when they have
21:32
glimpses of heaven like that that's
21:34
amazing well that's it's encouraging
21:36
because as i said the number of times my
21:38
mom's real close i'm kind of curious by
21:40
the way regarding that now my mom's
21:43
memory is going we just got back from
21:44
ohio she's got now she doesn't remember
21:47
from conversation to conversation
21:50
a few minutes late does god
21:53
let me ask it this way does god have a
21:54
harder time getting a hold of someone
21:56
like that who needs a little bit more of
21:58
him or does he have an easier time
22:00
because she's
22:02
tuned out of life what would that be
22:04
like
22:05
for her to maybe
22:07
i think it wouldn't matter what state
22:09
they're in mentally emotionally or
22:11
physically
22:13
when he wants to make himself known or
22:15
let them begin many times if we're
22:17
saying they feel no matter where they
22:19
are on their path if they belong to him
22:21
it he already has that connection with
22:24
them in their spirit
22:26
when he's ready to show them something
22:27
he's going to do it but normally that
22:29
will begin to change that person and
22:31
even if they can't remember what they
22:32
ate the day before who visit them the
22:34
day before they normally will not forget
22:36
if they begin to have encounters and
22:39
sometimes it's not like a face-to-face
22:41
encounter sometimes it's his presence uh
22:44
sometimes they they may say oh i feel
22:46
really good right now i i feel amazing i
22:49
feel such peace on me that's usually
22:51
because christ could be in that room
22:54
with them right there in that moment i
22:56
just know that sometimes it might be a
22:57
little bit easier in my thinking if your
23:00
natural mind begins to shut down or your
23:02
memory system the reason for that is
23:05
they can't remember the things that they
23:06
were angry about they can't remember
23:08
things
23:09
you know they can't remember their cares
23:11
they can't remember their concerns they
23:12
don't remember any things that were said
23:14
to them or maybe things that they did
23:16
that they shouldn't have you know maybe
23:18
unkind words that's gone from them so
23:21
that does totally open it up for the
23:24
lord to begin to either speak to them or
23:25
begin to show them things so this that
23:27
might be a good thing well you know it's
23:29
interesting you would say that i wasn't
23:30
going to share this but you know my
23:32
life's an open book right now but you
23:34
know
23:36
what what's that
23:39
you love it it's so open because every
23:40
millions are white i know well we went
23:43
out in march and i i was thinking i was
23:45
being a good dutiful
23:47
obedient loving son to offer her to come
23:51
and live with us from ohio and boy oh
23:53
heck broke liz and i understand this is
23:56
this is really what happens to a lot of
23:58
seniors at this age they if you think
24:03
if they're thinking you're taking their
24:04
blasted i mean she didn't say any bad
24:06
words but she was furious he was
24:09
okay so now fast forward we just can't
24:11
went out there in ohio and we were
24:14
itching her along
24:15
and then she called me after we we got
24:18
back and and
24:20
she's now she's inviting herself to live
24:22
with me instead of the other
24:24
i said i said well mom
24:27
you
24:27
you know after you treated me so
24:30
horribly and she goes what are you
24:31
talking about and she made me repeat it
24:33
five times and she didn't even remember
24:35
after five seconds after i told her she
24:37
said now tell me again what i did then
24:39
we found out later she doesn't even
24:41
remember any of us flying out there
24:43
during march
24:44
yeah that does that actually doesn't
24:48
happen as part of the process of just
24:50
being prepared many times just to just
24:53
to leave
24:54
um but that's normal and you're right
24:56
that's very normal
24:58
and
24:59
even most people when they of course if
25:01
they're still around here around a
25:02
heaven uh a hundred years old you you
25:05
should see some of them some of them are
25:06
sharp as attack but in the natural most
25:09
people's bodies and their systems and
25:11
the way they operate their thinking it
25:14
kind of begins to shut down some uh they
25:16
may be alert in every other way but
25:19
their memory from like the day before
25:21
whatever like she was saying to you that
25:23
might be god's blessing sometimes
25:25
because like you said she didn't
25:26
remember even saying that yeah it feels
25:28
like well i had i had actually been
25:31
again here's that open book thing i was
25:33
really wounded i was hurt and i kind of
25:36
cared that i kept forgetting her in my
25:37
heart all this time after i found out
25:40
yesterday that she has no recollection
25:43
i'm thinking what
25:45
what how what purpose would it be to
25:47
even have any hurt left what have i
25:49
heard about something that she has no
25:51
recollection of ever doing so it's like
25:53
it just fell off it just fell off
26:00
it's almost like
26:01
maybe a child does something not to hurt
26:03
you on purpose but it just happens you
26:05
know
26:06
and uh especially in the different
26:08
growing years they might say something
26:09
hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and
26:12
it it it's part of their growing the
26:15
young on the young side but when they're
26:18
older it's just part of what's natural
26:21
and i think that is i know people who've
26:23
forgotten that went through traumas and
26:25
stuff not not my family of other people
26:27
had horrible traumas when they got
26:29
closer to that age they didn't even
26:30
remember it it's like it just naturally
26:33
left them and they're happy i've also
26:36
known people who like almost couldn't
26:37
stand being around somebody and now they
26:40
love them it's the same
26:42
same people but but they really love
26:44
them because the person who was holding
26:46
that was gone because the memory part
26:48
was gone
26:49
so yes steve you can't you can't hold it
26:51
against somebody who to them like well
26:52
that never happened i would never say
26:54
that
26:55
they mean to you i never said that
26:58
yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't
27:00
you know i was
27:03
you were hurting that hurt
27:07
so anyway that's good all right here we
27:09
go
27:10
he goes i'm i'm finding out that my
27:12
seven-year-old son
27:13
is a seer what is your number one piece
27:15
of advice for a young seer for their
27:17
parents his sister has an autoimmune
27:20
issue and he said that once while we
27:21
were praying for her healing he looked
27:24
up and saw a small angel about four
27:26
inches tall
27:27
with wings wearing a red dress with her
27:29
hand on my daughter's foot praying for
27:32
her would that have been her guardian
27:34
angel that my son saw or a different one
27:37
sent for specific purpose so it's kind
27:39
of a multi-part there that probably
27:41
would be a different one sent for a
27:43
specific purpose but since you brought
27:44
that whole thing up
27:46
i i have known families who had a child
27:49
who was handicapped in some way
27:52
they get extra angels assigned to them
27:54
just because of that what we would call
27:57
a disability uh they get extra ones
27:59
assigned to them
28:00
and this young man now is so almost
28:03
absolutely normal he has some physical
28:05
things not causing him pain but growing
28:07
up they said he wouldn't live they said
28:09
he would never have a normal mind he
28:11
would never be able to talk never feed
28:13
himself and this was being fed to this
28:15
young child's parents like their whole
28:17
life they refused to accept that they
28:19
made sure he had everybody the care that
28:21
he had but they talked to him normal
28:24
they didn't treat him like there's
28:25
something wrong with him and he has two
28:28
angels that are with him all the time
28:29
besides his guardian angel and they're
28:31
there because of this this handicap
28:34
thing he has like i said this is like 30
28:36
years later and you know to see him he's
28:39
so filled with the light of god he's a
28:40
believer
28:42
and he's such a testimony to people
28:44
because of how he has grown in every way
28:46
that the doctor said he wouldn't be
28:47
alive but there were two angels assigned
28:50
to him and i knew somebody else who had
28:53
someone who was grown and they also had
28:56
two other angels and finally i just
28:57
asked holy spirit why are those other
28:59
angels with him
29:01
they looked different than from their
29:02
guardian angels and they said oh they're
29:04
sent to they they like protect the
29:07
anointing that they carry they're there
29:09
just to be uh yeah to bring things down
29:11
from heaven to them that god wants to
29:13
put into them i'm pretty certain that's
29:16
what that four inch angel was that was
29:18
like a little messenger angel bringing
29:20
something down they wouldn't be part of
29:22
the host but they probably were brought
29:24
down from heaven with one of the hosts
29:25
probably brought them down there so that
29:28
was great as far as being a seer
29:30
i would get a journal most important to
29:33
write down things that he's seeing it's
29:35
really important that they do that
29:38
when he gets older he'll be very
29:39
grateful for that journal uh like right
29:41
the day what he said he saw just write
29:44
in his words what he said
29:46
and then anytime he comes i've already
29:48
told some of my
29:50
my daughters to make sure that they do
29:51
that and so one of them has actually
29:53
started cataloging and now this child is
29:56
10
29:57
and he's not stopped seeing things but
29:59
it's very powerful to him that he can
30:01
read about the things he said that he
30:03
heard said or that he saw so definitely
30:07
most important thing you can do is uh no
30:09
matter what god ends up by doing with
30:10
that gift he has
30:12
it will be very powerful one day make
30:14
sure you're writing it down yeah and
30:16
what
30:16
what's the deal with the four inch angel
30:20
versus a seven foot angel i mean
30:22
what would you say about that
30:24
i would say
30:25
possibly whatever it is that the child
30:28
is um whatever it was you said that they
30:30
had it probably there may be like a
30:33
tribe of those little angels like that
30:35
made for that specific thing
30:38
that they were diagnosed with and that
30:40
maybe that may be something that god
30:42
sends maybe his life is in them they're
30:44
they're probably putting the life of god
30:46
in them oh the peace of god in them so
30:49
that would be their only assignment that
30:51
would be what they would be sent for
30:52
probably to keep that child in peace or
30:55
the presence of god yeah i guess the
30:57
issue was it was she just said it was an
30:58
autoimmune issue so she didn't say that
31:01
so
31:01
okay melanie asked how old does god look
31:05
how old would we perceive him to be in
31:07
earthly terms i've heard you describe
31:09
kind of seeing his face but i've also
31:11
heard you describe
31:12
almost a little bit of a veil so i mean
31:14
how do you see him you and i talked on
31:16
the cruise that one time and i said are
31:19
you telling me
31:21
cat that you're sitting down
31:23
sitting down talking face to face with
31:25
the god of the whole cosmos
31:28
and you just like yeah
31:32
you know
31:32
that should be crazy
31:34
it would be like
31:36
asking that question to a child
31:38
that really saw something let's say your
31:40
child went and saw somebody or met
31:42
somebody and you maybe try to convince
31:44
them i don't think you saw them they
31:45
would be so adamant
31:47
uh that the child like part of me
31:50
there's nothing in me that could make up
31:52
anything he wouldn't use me at all if he
31:54
if if i did that i i'm a detailed person
31:57
so i'm always going to see details one
32:00
of the reasons why i see him clearly is
32:02
he chose me because i have a
32:05
photographic memory and i am a detailed
32:07
person like i'm not going to hear just a
32:09
sentence that he says i i'm taking
32:12
places that i have to remember all that
32:14
i saw
32:15
and then they have to write that down if
32:16
it's things that god came and told me
32:18
personally and he said i want you to i
32:21
want you to share this with people then
32:22
i have to remember exactly what he said
32:25
it's not like it becomes um familiar in
32:28
any way i won't even use that term
32:30
because the power uh the power he
32:33
carries i'm sure he has to probably uh
32:36
maybe minimize that a little bit just
32:38
for me to be able to be around him i
32:40
probably i sometimes i feel like
32:42
when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's
32:43
just to be in his presence i feel like
32:45
i'm going to melt and go inside of him i
32:47
don't know how to yeah outs to explain
32:49
that the love that comes from him is so
32:52
powerful and it's it's not just what i
32:55
feel his appearance is
32:57
quite striking if i could say that
33:01
you feel life
33:02
coming from him because it did we all
33:05
lived there so it's like he's holding
33:07
everything in him all of time is in him
33:09
he didn't appear somewhere time came
33:11
from him
33:12
and i know i i love the one-liners he
33:14
tells me to tell people they get their
33:16
heads so undone they try to wrap their
33:18
head around it but most of these things
33:19
are spiritually um discerned
33:22
i would say in his normal appearance
33:25
because i've seen him like a certain way
33:27
many times then there's times i've seen
33:29
him with flames of fire with lightning
33:31
bolts shooting out of him when he's
33:33
walking against the darkness and stuff
33:35
like that his own appearance begins to
33:37
change it talks about the wrath of god
33:41
and any believer you should know this
33:43
that we are not appointed under that
33:45
wrath that he was demonstrating that
33:46
would be evil in darkness and wickedness
33:50
that he despises evil he despise what it
33:53
does to people so if he was gonna catch
33:55
me up there and talk about the justice
33:58
that is coming then his whole appearance
34:00
would be to bring justice that would
34:03
show me that that fierce side of him
34:05
okay
34:06
the loving father side of him which is
34:08
what i see many times
34:10
i know his hair is made out of light
34:12
remember the father is all spiritual but
34:15
he still has the ability to hold me if
34:17
he wants to
34:19
or i can just stand next to him i can
34:22
see into his eyes and usually they're
34:23
like blue flames of fire they're they
34:26
look blue to me blue flames of fire but
34:28
what comes out of him if you could
34:30
picture
34:31
um
34:32
i love the northern lights i've not seen
34:34
them in person but i've seen god
34:37
and that's what that rainbow looks like
34:38
coming out of him if you ever wondered
34:40
it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not
34:42
like you could just paint it around him
34:45
and it would just be there and not have
34:46
life and movement and i would have to
34:48
say seeing the northern lights in the
34:50
way that they move like this coming out
34:53
of him continually and on these
34:56
waves of his rainbow which he it comes
34:59
from him no man made the rainbow people
35:02
it comes from the living god it's part
35:03
of his own appearance and his person and
35:06
out of that comes these little spirits
35:08
of life they'll ride on this rainbow
35:09
then ride back in him that's what you
35:11
used to do when you lived inside god it
35:14
says in him we live we move we have our
35:18
very being the prophets and poets of old
35:20
have spoken of these things what things
35:22
when they were shown that
35:25
way in the past god would show himself
35:26
to people sometimes and sometimes it was
35:29
someone who was a poet and they actually
35:30
wrote poems about that
35:32
and so one of those made it in the word
35:34
of god so that's just a part of him to
35:37
see him like that the creative side
35:40
where i would see jesus step out of the
35:42
father and the father would say
35:44
something and then he would make what he
35:47
said that's why he was called the word
35:50
we know in the book of john it says that
35:53
we know in the book of john when john
35:54
said
35:56
the word was with god
35:59
and was god and there was nothing that
36:01
was made that was not made by him
36:04
that was jesus christ that's who he the
36:07
word came to the earth and died uh as
36:10
the son of god and so they're one and
36:13
the same the word jesus christ are the
36:15
same but when he was the word he only
36:17
had a spiritual body he was all spirit
36:20
it was still a body i know in your mind
36:22
you can't imagine you think of something
36:24
like a little like a spirit like
36:26
whatever you want to call it like the
36:28
spirit of a person or something they're
36:30
much more there's much more to them than
36:32
just some little wispy thing if you're
36:35
in a spirit world which heaven is and
36:38
everyone there in the spiritual body
36:40
they look solid in that world okay so
36:43
when i see the father most of the time
36:45
he looks like he's solid although he's
36:47
all spirit so i've seen him with love
36:50
coming out that consumes like the whole
36:52
army of god before they're going to go
36:54
somewhere um to bring justice for him
36:57
over someone on the earth he'll
36:59
literally go and just stand in their
37:00
midst and every one of them will be
37:03
permeated with his love he loves them
37:05
too
37:06
and his love and and just empowerment
37:09
and and when you see that he's he is
37:12
kind
37:13
and he is good and many people don't see
37:16
the father is good but jesus himself
37:18
said there's none good but the father
37:21
and so when you see there's many
37:23
different parts of him sides of him
37:25
uh that's who he is but
37:27
i i'm always undone
37:30
when he comes most of the time
37:32
unannounced
37:33
because what is on his heart to share
37:35
i'm i'm his revelator that's what he
37:37
calls me that means i reveal for him
37:41
i don't reveal for a man so i'm not
37:43
gonna usually i can answer questions ask
37:45
me if i've been told or shown it
37:47
otherwise i can't answer that i can't
37:49
answer for him if i haven't been shown
37:51
or told something
37:54
so it's really quite undone sometimes
37:56
the room i'm in like where i sleep which
37:59
is in my office built this moment
38:01
there's a huge portal in that room and
38:04
and sometimes he would come down through
38:06
that portal but sometimes most likely in
38:08
the hotel room a lot of times he'll just
38:10
walk through the wall like it's not
38:12
there and he'll begin to tell me stuff
38:14
sometimes he'll tell me to write it down
38:16
sometimes he'll write on the wall
38:18
and we know that even in the word of god
38:20
it talks about him doing these things so
38:22
for him
38:23
those are normal things he does when he
38:25
when he knows somebody who's going to
38:27
tell the truth who will not embellish on
38:29
what he
38:31
what he said which is extremely
38:33
significant even john the baptist had
38:36
one of the greatest revelations ever
38:37
given on the earth that's why they said
38:39
he's the greatest prophet of all that's
38:41
why that's in there he announced
38:43
literally
38:44
here is the son of god he actually got
38:47
to say that even though in the natural
38:48
he was jesus's cousin when he spoke
38:51
those words he wasn't speaking from a
38:53
natural viewpoint he was speaking from a
38:55
divine point and he never changed as
38:57
much as that he came that he came to say
39:00
that you had to repent of your sins
39:01
right he was one of the first ones to
39:03
give that message so what he said was so
39:06
powerful when he actually said here he
39:08
is
39:09
uh the the first and only person on the
39:11
earth who could actually say here's
39:13
jesus christ the son of the living god
39:15
this is the messiah that was a powerful
39:17
word but he never changed what he said
39:19
because that's what god told him to say
39:22
wow yeah and you've always been obedient
39:24
that way you know almost to a
39:26
frustrating point because people will
39:27
ask you something i've seen it even on
39:29
um
39:30
what's the kenneth copeland channel i
39:32
can't think of any victory channel or
39:33
whatever and flashpoint and they'll try
39:35
to get you to answer a question you'll
39:37
say i can only tell you what god told me
39:39
and then he'll launch into your
39:41
prophecy that was that's pretty i've
39:43
learned learned a good way um also
39:45
that's part of that same question is
39:47
does god the father does he look like a
39:50
grandpa does he look like a dad who's
39:52
older what what age
39:54
impression when he leaves well i know
39:56
you're wanting most people will judge
39:58
somebody by their skin
39:59
okay or conditioning is a skin and does
40:01
it have wrinkles does it not have
40:03
wrinkles does it have like brown spots
40:07
and most people judge people nor in the
40:10
natural you know um if they have white
40:12
hair no hair
40:14
i mean i i can't answer him in that
40:17
context i cannot put him in a category
40:20
as a human i know that i see life in him
40:23
i see still even now talking you can
40:26
still see his face
40:28
very clearly and it's filled with life
40:31
there's no age in him he's never going
40:34
to age his hair is white it's alive his
40:38
hair on his head is living it's not
40:40
short hair it's down below his shoulders
40:43
uh he has this amazing uh wonderful
40:46
beard
40:47
um
40:48
it just you know i can't i tell people
40:50
say what do you think he looks like
40:51
kenny rogers he doesn't look like a
40:53
human
40:56
everyone fails in comparison to him
40:59
because of the stuff he carries that
41:02
makes him who he is
41:04
but i can just say that you will you'll
41:06
never regret giving yourself to his son
41:09
that is the one where you are assured of
41:11
meeting him in person
41:13
he's excited about seeing you he cannot
41:15
wait for you to get back home to heaven
41:18
and i hope this gives you a glimpse of
41:20
the other side of dying for you you're
41:22
losing something for him he's gaining
41:24
something he's gaining his son or his
41:27
daughter back to himself he is so
41:30
excited all of heaven celebrates when
41:32
they come home so for them there's
41:35
there's there's no loss in their mind uh
41:38
from the time they step out of the
41:39
spiritual body they're stepping right
41:41
there they feel his presence they see
41:43
their angels their excitement floods
41:46
them you know i mean it's not like they
41:48
don't love you to actually love you even
41:49
more
41:50
but but just to be in his presence i
41:53
understand why jesus when he had to live
41:55
on the earth he'd go away to the
41:56
mountains to to be with his father he
41:58
would go away to go be that he needed it
42:00
after living here with humans are you
42:02
kidding
42:03
and so king himself
42:05
loves the father and i think for him the
42:08
greatest thing he gets to do is take us
42:10
back to him when you come home to heaven
42:12
he walks you up the steps of god's
42:15
throne the father's throne and gives you
42:18
back to him he says
42:20
your son your daughter they've come home
42:22
and let me tell you the celebration will
42:24
start in heaven at that time but but he
42:27
is not little he's not a little person
42:29
in any way whatsoever but this is what i
42:32
love about the father one of the
42:33
greatest things i like to say about him
42:35
is he could be a hundred feet tall two
42:37
thousand feet tall whatever he wants to
42:39
be he can be that size i think sitting
42:42
on the throne many times and to me he
42:44
would look like maybe i don't know 10 15
42:46
feet high he he doesn't want to make
42:48
himself invisible to you if you're
42:50
coming home to meet him but i've seen
42:52
him holding the earth in his hands so i
42:54
hope you get this picture i've seen him
42:57
back in time when he was making the
42:59
earth holding it in his hand this is the
43:02
father when the word would step out he'd
43:05
make it gave it to the father the father
43:07
began to speak over the earth itself
43:10
he would pour water from himself he's
43:12
going to put the water on the earth he
43:14
poured from his own south the river of
43:16
the river of life that comes from him he
43:19
poured that in as the ocean on the earth
43:23
and so whatever they did they did
43:24
together and so i've seen him that big
43:27
to hold the earth in his hand
43:32
i've seen him be you know make himself
43:36
well call enormous eyes just to hold you
43:38
he'll stand up on the throne and hold
43:39
you to himself
43:41
and i also know this about him that even
43:44
though he's on the throne
43:46
he himself can make himself
43:49
not leaving the throne
43:51
small enough to step inside of himself
43:54
to play with all the little spirits of
43:56
life that's who you were are you serious
43:59
with you in himself while he's sitting
44:02
on the throne people he knows what's
44:04
going on
44:06
if you think he's willing to give this
44:09
earth that he loved that he spoke over
44:12
to evil what do you think he didn't have
44:14
and he kicked it out it got unseated
44:18
lost his place lost his authority lost
44:21
his power
44:22
lucifer did you think he's changed his
44:25
mind about that because he has not
44:28
he loves you too much and this time is
44:32
too important for him to give it over to
44:34
evil all i know is they're going to lay
44:36
down roll over and beg god for mercy
44:40
when those days of justice fall upon
44:42
them and for some of them it will be too
44:45
late
44:47
wow wow catboy the anointing hit you
44:49
right there god came
44:51
god came down wow
44:53
wildcat
44:54
cat let me can i explore a little bit
44:56
you talk about the son loves the fat
44:58
father loves his son and son loves the
44:59
father i think we've talked about this a
45:01
little bit let me
45:03
drill down you know when i was raised up
45:04
we'd always make sure we pray in the
45:06
name of jesus make sure you say the name
45:08
of jesus and it became like a
45:10
a formulaic word make sure you mention
45:13
the name of jesus because then god can
45:15
has to do it but but is there something
45:18
in when we pray in the name of jesus
45:21
that we should at that moment
45:24
almost tap into how much the father
45:26
loves jesus
45:28
as we're saying that as opposed to just
45:30
making sure you pronounce jesus or
45:33
yeshua what
45:35
what is that go ahead and understand who
45:38
you're talking about when you use this
45:40
name
45:41
uh and if if there's probably if you're
45:44
saying it just from head knowledge this
45:46
is what you want to know don't ever say
45:48
his name from head knowledge
45:50
okay you need to say it from revelation
45:54
like what i just spoke okay that's how
45:57
you should feel every time you say his
45:59
name for any purpose you're having power
46:03
in that name of jesus that's why it is
46:05
one of your greatest weapons the name of
46:07
the name of christ okay his name his
46:10
blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of
46:14
who he is he right now he right now is
46:17
the king of glory people uh he has many
46:21
other titles besides jesus christ when
46:24
you talk about him as your savior and
46:26
what he did for you he also gave you
46:28
power over all the power of the enemy he
46:33
gave us three things you see him from
46:34
that viewpoint it should almost be like
46:38
a threat to hell that you are saying the
46:41
name of jesus christ
46:43
wow wow
46:45
yeah that's a whole lot different
46:47
well that's what the lord's been showing
46:48
me lately is is to tap into to that to
46:53
him to the reality
46:54
um
46:56
yeah and this one you kind of answered
46:58
this this is the next question but you
46:59
kind of addressed this
47:01
it says before jesus came to the earth
47:02
and he was called the word in heaven did
47:05
his spiritual body then look like
47:08
what we know as his human body or what
47:10
we think of as his human body or was his
47:12
body more like i don't know what i don't
47:14
know what this means was his body more
47:16
like the holy spirit i i think this
47:18
person's grasping between um
47:22
a cloud like the holy spirit or the body
47:24
of jesus but i i think they both have
47:27
um
47:28
a
47:29
spiritual butt right
47:32
yeah i would say when you are you
47:34
talking about let me get the timing
47:36
right are they talking about what jesus
47:37
looked like when he stepped out of his
47:39
physical body let me see when jesus came
47:41
to the earth and he was called the word
47:44
in heaven he was called the word did his
47:46
spiritual body then in heaven
47:50
look the same as his human body looked
47:52
on earth
47:54
oh when he was the word did it look the
47:56
same as the physical body on earth that
47:59
seemed to be the question no physical
48:00
body changed him from what he looked
48:03
like
48:05
because if it looked just like the word
48:07
why did not satan recognize him oh good
48:11
point oh good point he did not know when
48:14
he took him to the mountain temptation
48:15
that was the son of the living god he
48:18
didn't know that he was trying to find
48:19
out who he was
48:22
he was always pursuing who is he until
48:25
he himself said who he was he did not
48:28
know
48:29
he did not know he was the word that was
48:31
with god the word was all spiritual body
48:34
that was his divine body a spiritual
48:37
body a spiritual body like we were just
48:39
talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know
48:41
what they're talking about you're
48:43
talking about what they've seen on tv or
48:44
movies this little wispy thing steps out
48:46
they can go through walls and the reason
48:48
why uh your spiritual body down here
48:50
could walk through a wall is that
48:52
physical wall is a temporary substance
48:56
it's even a temporary realm the physical
48:59
realm is not the original realm the
49:01
spiritual realm where the whole world
49:03
called heaven was created where tribes
49:06
of angels were made where you go back
49:08
home to live in that place you don't
49:10
pass to the walls in heaven and your
49:12
spiritual body okay you have substance
49:15
in your spiritual body but as far as the
49:18
appearance thing the word was very
49:20
powerful he could go in and out wherever
49:23
he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he
49:25
had no flesh attached to him the other
49:28
sacrifice you don't realize he made was
49:31
he was willing not just to walk and live
49:34
in a physical body he had to keep the
49:36
physical body wow and so when your
49:39
little spirit person leaves god when you
49:42
lived in god you didn't look like
49:44
this okay you had a little appearance
49:47
you had a face you little face you had
49:48
body you could play inside of god and
49:50
the river of life climbed the mountain
49:51
that's in him a ride in and out on the
49:54
waves of the rainbow you could do those
49:56
things in your little spiritual body but
49:59
you didn't look
50:00
this gave you an identity okay that's
50:03
one of the reasons why he wanted you to
50:05
have a fleshly body number one so you
50:07
could live in this physical body in this
50:10
physical world and do things for him
50:12
here
50:13
but as opposed to the word the word look
50:16
different than jesus christ did because
50:19
the flesh wrapped around your spiritual
50:21
body
50:22
your spiritual body actually adapts to
50:26
the flesh
50:27
because when your throat man steps out
50:29
of this body when mine does
50:32
it looks the same as if i was in my
50:34
fleshly body except
50:37
i look a whole lot younger and so were
50:40
you one day so know that satan did not
50:43
recognize
50:45
who jesus christ was he didn't know he
50:47
was the word okay who made him actually
50:51
uh satan was created he's a created
50:53
being
50:54
he didn't know that that was the word he
50:56
didn't know at all
50:58
and that that was part of the bushwhack
51:00
people so that was part of the butch
51:02
whack that jesus would almost have a
51:04
disguise that satan wouldn't recognize
51:07
for a very long time jesus could do
51:09
things he wanted to say what he wanted
51:11
to and
51:12
and satan i'm sure was quite shocked
51:15
when jesus christ you know
51:17
living on the earth began to cast demons
51:20
out of things that really freaked him
51:21
out i'm really sure
51:23
now he said okay this person's got power
51:25
he's got power i i don't didn't know he
51:27
had this power uh
51:30
and he's not really as brilliant as he
51:32
wants people to think he is because when
51:34
he got kicked out the heaven part of his
51:35
mind was seared by that lightning bolt
51:38
i'm just letting you know so he did not
51:40
know that that jesus christ was the word
51:43
of god because jesus himself with his
51:46
fleshly body looked different than the
51:49
word and right now he still looks like
51:51
jesus christ who lived and walked on the
51:53
earth except for this
51:55
he has his glorified body already he was
51:58
glorified that body was glorified when
52:00
he stepped up from hell came up from
52:02
hell and stepped into that physical body
52:04
that was dead laying on that slab
52:07
life infused it but not just life but
52:09
the glory of god infused the body of
52:12
jesus christ and he walks around now in
52:13
his physical glorified body
52:16
in heaven so when he comes to see me
52:18
that's that's who i see is the one in
52:20
the glorified body and you know when you
52:22
said uh this is the first time it ever
52:24
clicked that we would have looked
52:26
different inside the father because we
52:28
would only look like we looked down
52:30
because i'm a combination of my mother
52:32
and my father that's
52:34
the appearance i took on
52:36
that's right because i had a natural
52:38
mother father so i don't look totally
52:40
different in heaven before god selected
52:42
the family for me i guess yes
52:45
he knew all along
52:47
he knew you would be looking like just
52:49
like you do now steve
52:51
he knew everybody would be looking like
52:52
that like they do right now in their
52:54
physical body he knew
52:56
when you were in him you were chosen
52:59
at that point for some things in your
53:01
life he put a little mark on you he knew
53:04
i would be a prophet he knew you would
53:06
make a home for the prophets to come and
53:08
say whatever god wanted to say he knew
53:10
that we probably knew each other we
53:12
probably were friends inside of him that
53:14
would be cool to know that would be
53:16
really interesting you think so we
53:18
wouldn't
53:18
be doing so because
53:20
i know
53:21
those who were friends inside of god if
53:23
he chose you to be a part of your
53:25
lifetime
53:27
uh in a significant way he would
53:30
absolutely choose people that kids that
53:32
you were like call them kids they all
53:34
little they're all little at all like a
53:36
bunch of little kids living in him and
53:38
and you had i would see little kids
53:40
sometimes with little groups playing
53:42
with each other and doing things with
53:43
each other and we we can have a whole
53:46
whole just segment about life and god uh
53:49
really that would be quite fascinating
53:51
to find out revelation about what did
53:53
you do in there what went on there what
53:54
does it look like and there's another
53:56
whole thing
53:57
but i'm pretty sure that we probably
53:59
were friends i know my husband and i
54:02
were friends when we were we were part
54:04
of this the little group that we had
54:06
uh inside god that we played there's
54:08
millions inside of him but
54:10
there's no back to god there's no size
54:13
to god it's like inside of him he's part
54:16
of infinity
54:17
and that at one time you know before he
54:19
made the earth we all everyone who ever
54:21
was or will be lived in him you can
54:24
imagine in your head let's hope you
54:26
maybe that makes you realize how
54:27
powerful he is about who he is uh he is
54:30
limitless in his understanding and his
54:32
knowledge and in his revelation he's
54:35
unlimited in almost every way he's
54:37
unlimited can i ask you a a difficult
54:41
question
54:42
that some watching will even um
54:45
it would be their question it would be
54:47
their question
54:49
god knew you before you were born he
54:51
knew what you would look like before you
54:52
were born and then there are people who
54:55
are product of of either
54:58
born out of wedlock in some cases rape
55:01
how do you what do you say to people who
55:03
say but what about me how could god have
55:05
known me
55:07
and allowed me to either have
55:10
children of abuse or
55:12
what do you say about the plan of god
55:14
and what
55:15
sometimes we're allowed to go through
55:17
in this life
55:19
i think one day
55:21
when you get your book given to you that
55:23
was written about you in heaven you'll
55:24
understand that he didn't choose any of
55:27
the evil stuff at all that wasn't had
55:29
nothing to do with god at all he sent us
55:31
to this earth it's an imperfect earth
55:33
there's imperfect people
55:35
everybody is held accountable for what
55:37
they did they they there there will be
55:39
an accountability uh of course when you
55:42
receive jesus christ that has something
55:44
to do with wiping that away
55:46
but i can tell you this he sent you this
55:48
is what happened he picked you for
55:50
certain things he sent you to earth at
55:53
the time he needed you to be here
55:56
he didn't choose those people to be
55:58
wicked they weren't always wicked when
55:59
they were children they weren't wicked
56:01
okay so everybody making their own
56:03
choices are raising their children
56:06
in a certain way because of what's in
56:08
them
56:09
and that's why i always i talk to young
56:11
people a lot i've done young people
56:13
meetings and i say you have to
56:14
understand that you're not just going to
56:17
be raising children one day you are
56:19
shaping souls
56:21
that came from god for his use do not be
56:24
abusive i'm i'm telling them this
56:26
already but you know what that's if they
56:28
watch a lot of violent stuff
56:30
just go into their soul and even
56:32
psychiatrists know this they don't
56:34
understand the workings of the soul or
56:36
what the soul looks like but what you
56:38
what you choose what you listen to all
56:41
the time will become a part of you what
56:43
you watch all the time would become a
56:44
part of me and eventually you might even
56:46
act out some of those things you see
56:49
and that's why there's evil satan helps
56:51
that to happen he makes sure it happen
56:54
happens and yet there's some people who
56:56
grew up in a violent household
56:59
that that never part part took of that
57:01
they they were strong they never allowed
57:03
that to affect their life or how they
57:06
lived it later and became and were
57:08
totally totally different people than
57:10
what that person was that had them so
57:12
you have to understand god didn't create
57:15
he didn't make evil happen
57:17
he didn't even make lucifer satan
57:20
if you go back that far let's go that
57:22
far he may lucifer to be an anointed
57:25
being who would help lead worship
57:27
for him to create glory for him to be a
57:30
light for him that's what that's what
57:33
lucifer's job was he made him for that
57:36
he didn't make him to be evil it says in
57:38
the bible iniquity was found in him
57:42
that was significantly because god
57:44
didn't put that in him
57:46
okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's
57:49
own thoughts and own
57:50
wicked desires to be greater than god
57:53
and want to rule
57:55
from that came evil began to be birthed
57:58
inside of him before it came out so
58:00
because there is evil
58:03
present in this world one day there
58:05
won't be any
58:07
we can look at it that way but god
58:09
didn't choose you to be tormented he
58:12
didn't choose that those people who
58:15
raised you had every right to choose to
58:17
do what was right regardless of what
58:19
within them they had every right to be
58:22
kind to you to nourish you
58:24
to nurture you and everything and know
58:26
god and no happiness and joy
58:29
and not have your mind tormented later
58:31
in your life all the things that
58:32
happened to you as a child but god
58:33
didn't create evil
58:35
in this earth
58:37
he didn't know evil would be here but he
58:40
also sent his son for the very purpose
58:42
that you could be free from anything
58:44
you went through you can be free from
58:46
any event no matter how bad it was or
58:48
when it happened you don't have to carry
58:50
that stuff on the inside of you
58:52
and that's why he came to bring freedom
58:54
in life he had an appointed time to be
58:57
here even jesus christ had to be made
59:00
into a seed this is what it says christ
59:03
was made into a seed he was made okay he
59:06
had he was going to have flesh on him
59:08
and i think on my our next um report we
59:11
do i'll actually read the poem holy
59:13
spirit gave me
59:14
about when the announcements began to
59:16
made it be made in heaven that the word
59:18
would die for us that the word would be
59:20
made flesh which it says in the bible
59:24
he was planted as a seed in the womb of
59:26
mary but there's this whole beautiful
59:28
story
59:29
it's called the year before christmas
59:32
and what literally began to happen in
59:34
heaven um you know before he was even
59:36
sent
59:37
and i'm not going to do that today but
59:39
we'll do that next week but you have to
59:41
understand god has been from the
59:42
beginning to the end and no matter what
59:44
you thought you could do that would be
59:46
better
59:48
he
59:49
has a plan
59:51
he was willing to sacrifice his own son
59:53
who was tormented and tortured and so
59:56
horribly abused wrongfully accused uh
59:59
you know unjustly treated
60:02
and and basically murdered
60:05
he knew that
60:06
his son would go through that but what
60:08
comes from that and this is the thing
60:11
you even though it's not god's intention
60:13
to make you suffer for him his son
60:16
suffered for all of us
60:18
you can take your life no matter what
60:20
you've been through and you can lose all
60:21
of that all of that horror all of that
60:23
abuse all that torment all that trauma
60:26
lucifer from your soul in jesus name and
60:28
jesus will come pull it out of you
60:30
and it will be like it didn't happen in
60:33
other words you might think about it but
60:34
there'll be no torment in it there'll be
60:36
no suffering in it
60:38
because we can be totally free
60:41
from all of the effects of evil but god
60:43
didn't make people bad he didn't make
60:46
evil itself
60:48
and the evil one who's done this will be
60:51
more tormented than anything that ever
60:53
existed throughout all the time he satan
60:57
will be more tormented than any other
60:59
anyone else who ends up in that lake of
61:01
fire
61:02
satan will be the most hated being in
61:04
there the most tormented and he will
61:06
have no
61:08
power whatsoever so you can think of
61:11
it's one thing you to be in a place of
61:14
torment but when you everyone is
61:16
tormenting that one person and they
61:17
can't escape or get away uh that is his
61:20
end he will have nothing from anything
61:23
he's done god also knows that he's a
61:26
just god
61:27
and kind loving god so you need to see
61:30
him the kind loving one who gave the
61:32
greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying
61:35
to cover up things that were done to you
61:37
my parents didn't torment me uh but i
61:40
certainly was picked on and and made fun
61:42
of most of my life growing up and i just
61:45
had to let it go i don't even know about
61:46
losing you know i decided i'm going to
61:47
let it go and go on i have stuff i have
61:50
to do and i want to see done
61:54
you have to make the same decision but
61:55
let me tell you god does know everything
61:58
and he is not it is seedtime and harvest
62:01
people this is not
62:03
don't get your 50 bottles of anointing
62:05
oil out okay because this is not the end
62:08
time harvest it talks about in the bible
62:10
before all the other stuff start to
62:12
happen we're not even ready to handle
62:14
that harvest like that okay you're going
62:16
to be powerful you're going to be filled
62:18
with god when those days come but it's a
62:21
seedtime and harvest for what you've
62:23
been planting what the left has been
62:25
planting harvest for them is about to
62:28
happen what you've been planting by
62:30
yours making a stand still filled with
62:33
life encouraging people bringing people
62:35
hope you're going to get the greatest
62:36
harvest you've seen in your life so far
62:39
this is the seedtime and harvest is
62:40
happening now just that's for free what
62:43
time is it time and harvest for us
62:46
individually for whole groups of people
62:48
if it's evil you're going to get a
62:50
harvest of justice and and probably the
62:53
rather that and
62:54
while
62:55
while you're talking
62:57
as this as we close out i know i feel
62:59
like there's some people out there that
63:00
says i wish someone would just show me
63:03
right now how to get saved i i like this
63:06
stuff
63:07
no one's ever led me to the lord how do
63:09
i do that would you
63:11
i sure would love to do that yeah
63:14
and and let me tell you it's really
63:16
uh man can come
63:18
complicate things so much sometimes we
63:21
feel like we don't read you know the the
63:23
50-page syllabus
63:25
or if we don't have someone who's like
63:27
known god forever lead you even a child
63:30
can lead someone to be born again you
63:32
make a decision in your own self that
63:35
you want jesus christ okay
63:37
you're tired of what you've been living
63:39
in you're tired of the junk going on in
63:40
this world you see no hope if you don't
63:43
have hope right now
63:44
you may not have a lot of god in you
63:47
because right now he's releasing hope in
63:49
life when you are born again
63:52
literally your your soul gets a shower
63:55
of the blood of jesus christ to wipe
63:57
away every sin you've ever committed no
64:00
matter what it is when it happened in
64:03
your life if you want to walk as
64:05
righteous if you don't have jesus christ
64:07
you're unrighteous okay you're not
64:08
counted as righteous if you want to be
64:10
counted as righteous you're going to be
64:12
part of god's plan what he has in this
64:14
earth you need to know his son jesus
64:16
christ
64:17
you first of all recognize that jesus
64:19
christ is the son of the living god he
64:22
did die for your sins and he did it
64:24
purposefully he chose to do that so the
64:27
first thing you do is repent of any sin
64:29
you've ever committed no matter when it
64:31
happened or how that happened re repent
64:34
recognize that you are a sinner and you
64:36
repent and you receive jesus christ as
64:38
your savior that's the first step that
64:41
you do that the second step is you thank
64:44
him for dying for you thank him for your
64:46
sins being forgiven and it will be like
64:50
in god's books in heaven when you
64:52
receive christ he literally will go and
64:54
wipe out in his books every sin up to
64:58
that point every one you've ever
64:59
committed will be wiped off like you
65:01
never did them that's how powerful the
65:04
blood of christ is
65:06
then you say i receive everything that
65:08
that blood affords me i receive
65:09
everything that that sacrifice that
65:12
affords me i realize now i'm part of
65:14
god's family i'm a part of his family
65:17
i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free
65:20
by grace you are a powerful born again
65:24
uh believer now jesus christ will
65:26
literally step inside of you that's what
65:28
happens he'll step inside of you
65:31
it says you invite him to live in you
65:33
and he will and then you begin to feel
65:36
his presence
65:38
miraculous things will begin to happen
65:39
because now you're carrying his presence
65:42
with you and anytime temptation comes to
65:44
you after that make sure you say no i'm
65:46
not that person anymore it says you're
65:49
born again you are a new creation and
65:52
the reason why god can say that is none
65:54
of your past sins you're not being
65:56
looked at anymore by a sinful person
65:59
you're being looked at as god's son or
66:01
his daughter whichever one he made you
66:04
and now he opens doors for you to
66:07
understand him more make sure you get a
66:08
bible i would encourage you to start
66:11
reading the new testament read the book
66:12
of john and make sure you study the book
66:14
of john as a lot about who jesus was
66:17
also talks about what what it's like to
66:19
be born again and in in there it's real
66:22
exciting and then make sure you speak to
66:24
him you need to know that prayer is very
66:27
important for you you don't just get you
66:28
know born again and now i'm saved and
66:31
live your life like he always lived it
66:33
i'm not saying you can't stay at the
66:34
same job or live in the same home you'll
66:36
have the same family but you need to
66:38
recognize now you're a new creation made
66:41
by god because of the blood of christ
66:43
you begin to seek him and what does that
66:45
mean get in a room by yourself and say
66:47
jesus christ i want to know you more i
66:49
want i want to know you i want to know
66:51
what your heart is i want to know what
66:53
your thoughts are of me and i would say
66:55
i i used to do it at one point every day
66:57
of my life i did that usually late at
66:59
night i'm not saying you have to do
67:00
anything late at night and this is the
67:02
thing some people say you have to take a
67:04
certain posture it's okay if you want to
67:06
kneel to do it you can be walking down
67:08
the street and get born again you can
67:10
get born again arriving in your car he's
67:12
looking to know you more he is seeking
67:15
you harder than you are seeking him
67:19
so the most important thing in your life
67:21
should be to receive christ and then
67:23
begin to pursue to know him more and
67:26
then you start on a whole different
67:29
journey
67:30
in your life the inside of you has
67:32
changed your spirit man god puts light
67:34
in your spirit your spirit man has light
67:37
in it it gives it more understanding it
67:39
gives you more of his presence inside of
67:41
you
67:42
your name is literally written in the
67:44
lamb's book of life he'll write it right
67:46
there at that moment that you get born
67:48
again and so powerful things happen in
67:50
the spirit when you are born again so i
67:53
would just say just you can say a simple
67:54
prayer so let's just say this you can
67:56
say
67:57
jesus christ
67:59
jesus christ
68:01
i want to receive you as my savior i
68:04
want to receive you as my savior
68:06
i recognize
68:08
we recognize
68:10
you are the son of the living god you
68:13
are the son of the living god
68:15
you came to this world to die for my
68:18
sins you came to this world to die for
68:20
my sins
68:21
so i repent of all sin so i repent of
68:24
all sin
68:26
up to this moment in my life up to this
68:28
moment in my life
68:30
i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to
68:33
wash me clean
68:35
with your blood with your blood
68:38
i receive your sacrifice i receive your
68:41
sacrifice
68:43
and i now thank you and i now thank you
68:46
for making me part of the family of god
68:49
for making me part of the family of god
68:52
i give you permission i give you
68:54

03:14
hearing all about christmas town um but
03:17
before we start do you have any current
03:19
events that you want to share with us
03:22
i just want to say some of the greatest
03:24
things ever about to happen people
03:27
um you know i can share but not share
03:29
all of it i just know that things are
03:31
rumbling
03:32
in the undergrounds not just the
03:34
earthquakes but uh behind the scenes and
03:38
then covert places the solicitor's
03:40
covert
03:42
i can just tell you the new norm will be
03:44
better than what it was before people
03:46
it's not gonna we're not gonna be
03:47
controlled it's not gonna be a time of
03:49
sorrows we are not entering into the
03:52
perilous times we have way too much
03:54
stuff to do in this earth for jesus
03:55
christ and of course you know this show
03:58
highlights him also but it highlights
04:01
one of his best friends in heaven his
04:02
name would be nicholas so that's about
04:05
it let's just get going with those
04:06
questions
04:07
yes awesome so the first the first thing
04:11
i want you to just tell like a brief um
04:14
a little bit about what where christmas
04:16
tower is and what is christmas town for
04:18
the people who haven't heard you talk
04:20
about it before
04:21
christmas town is actually a place in
04:24
heaven
04:25
and for those who don't know me um
04:27
you you may not be able to
04:29
wrap your natural mind around anything
04:31
that i say because it comes by
04:33
revelation
04:34
revelation comes from the heart of the
04:36
father it's not man's thoughts man's
04:38
ideas are man's plans
04:40
it's god's and so i've been taking on
04:44
tours of heaven not just once but many
04:46
times and before you start you know
04:48
beating me up i forgive you i forgive
04:50
everybody out there so don't waste your
04:52
time doing that i have too much of a
04:54
life to live for jesus christ
04:56
but i do want to say this years ago
05:00
kenneth hagin senior has somebody
05:02
working for him who actually still on
05:03
this earth her name is billy brim
05:06
and um and he would tell billy brim
05:09
before these days are over
05:11
uh things that will begin to happen he
05:14
said i won't be here this kenneth hagin
05:15
senior speaking to billy brim who worked
05:17
for him okay
05:19
and uh and he said to her before these
05:21
days are all over something great will
05:23
begin to happen god will begin to catch
05:26
people up to heaven and taking them on
05:27
tours
05:29
really those are his words and then
05:31
bringing them back to earth this is
05:33
without dying so they can share
05:35
revelation about heaven and that he said
05:37
that to billy brim and when she found
05:40
out about me she was so excited she
05:42
called me i sent her my first book i
05:44
think i sent her the second book too and
05:47
she said she knew this was true because
05:49
years ago kenneth hagin senior who's now
05:51
in heaven uh had told her this would
05:54
happen and she saw that i was taken on
05:56
tours continually she knew that was the
05:58
truth so there's somebody right there
06:00
who's an eyewitness
06:01
that god had this plane all along i just
06:04
happened to be one of those people i've
06:06
been taking in many places in heaven
06:07
over the last 20 some years and i was
06:10
taken to exciting profound places that
06:13
were so filled with awe and wonder but
06:16
has also taken places to have fun
06:20
and the father said to me why would i
06:22
not have fun if i said in my word you
06:24
know you must come like a little child
06:27
he said i'd be in a lot of trouble if i
06:28
didn't have fun places for people who
06:30
are like little kids to play in and one
06:33
of the places i was taken to
06:36
is a place in heaven where it snows all
06:38
the time now i know a lot of people are
06:40
going to love this more will love it
06:42
than not
06:43
it snows all the time but you have to
06:45
remember i'm talking about heaven not
06:47
the earth the snow is alive
06:50
everything in heaven has life the plants
06:53
sing the plants talk the birds the
06:55
creatures even the buildings shout out
06:58
the ground shouts out all the time and
07:00
worships jesus christ they have a place
07:02
called the friendly forest you can go
07:03
and have conversations with trees with
07:05
the rocks uh with the creatures there's
07:08
so much life there you can't escape it
07:09
so i hope that under makes you
07:11
understand
07:12
in in christmas time when you go there
07:14
that is where nicholas lives
07:17
yes nick some people call him saint nick
07:19
some people come saying you call them
07:20
whatever his actual name is nicholas and
07:23
god created a place he knew one day so
07:27
this place has been around don't go into
07:29
the druids and all the stuff that it's a
07:31
bad place and it's part of this thing
07:33
this thing i'm sorry but god was there
07:35
heaven was there before anybody was born
07:37
on the earth he had places already
07:40
planned in heaven that he knew that we
07:42
would love to come there and he knew
07:44
people would come home and use their
07:45
gifts in heaven which is what you do
07:48
so nicholas had a place all prepared for
07:51
him when he passed to come nicholas
07:54
lived in the 3rd century i think 270 a.d
07:57
that's really close you know it's only
07:59
270 years after christ died so everybody
08:02
was still talking about him knew about
08:04
him in those days but of course you know
08:06
our enemy satan wasn't happy about that
08:08
so he'd always send people out into the
08:10
crowds into places to talk against
08:13
the deity and the person of jesus christ
08:16
so nicholas was actually this is the
08:18
person who people then made him become
08:20
like santa claus he actually was a very
08:23
wealthy person he lived in turkey you
08:25
can look all this up even i think
08:26
wikipedia talks about it he lived in
08:29
turkey and uh he would offender of the
08:31
faith and i think he was even a bishop
08:34
but he was very fierce when people would
08:36
attack the person of jesus christ or
08:38
speak against who he was
08:40
he had a staff he would use that staff
08:42
for things other than leading his sleigh
08:45
how about that people he actually had a
08:47
sleigh he would take gifts to children
08:50
he used to set them outside their home
08:52
at that certain time of the year and
08:54
then thieves would begin to come by and
08:56
get it so he is the one who actually
08:58
started the whole stocking thing the
09:00
parents would hang stockings inside and
09:02
nicholas would come by and leave gifts
09:04
for them this is the truth i'm telling
09:06
you and so all that came the wonderful
09:09
story we have now but i do want to say
09:12
this he lives there he loves the snow
09:14
it's known where he lived on earth
09:16
and so god created this beautiful place
09:18
when you make a snowman in christmas
09:20
town in heaven it is alive so i kind of
09:23
want some of the christmas songs and the
09:25
things that they say
09:27
uh your sleigh can go through through
09:29
the air it can go on the ground uh
09:31
there's all kinds of things to enjoy
09:33
there ice skating and i i learned from
09:36
the father that our seasons on the earth
09:40
are here there's four main seasons
09:42
and we know that there's winter summer
09:44
spring and fall
09:46
and god said i took a a shadow of an
09:49
actual place
09:51
that existed in heaven i took a shadow
09:53
of it and made it a season on the earth
09:56
so that's one of the reasons why we have
09:58
snow on the earth because it is in
10:00
heaven it was there first and so he made
10:02
this beautiful place it's like this
10:04
beautiful village and everybody goes
10:06
there with their families who are in
10:08
heaven and yes everybody gives gifts but
10:11
then excuse me the main thing they do in
10:13
christmas town is they celebrate the
10:16
birth of jesus christ
10:18
it's like happy birthday all the time in
10:20
heaven because people go to there to see
10:22
sometimes jesus will show up and people
10:24
will bring him gifts they pile gifts
10:26
gifts you know at a place for him
10:28
but they get gifts before they leave
10:30
christmas town because they're huge
10:32
trees in christmas town and all the
10:35
lights on the trees are baby stars
10:38
like that he plucked out of the sky put
10:40
them on the trees and they all sing
10:42
worship music to jesus but they also
10:44
sing christmas songs
10:46
so this is a delightful place that the
10:49
kids will love to go but even big kids
10:51
you know parents and whole families go
10:53
to this beautiful place and they really
10:56
enjoy it
10:57
so that's where nicholas lives he made
10:59
this place where nicholas has a shop
11:03
he still makes toys
11:04
and my brother recently passed and he
11:06
used to say all the time when i get to
11:08
heaven one day i'll work with saint
11:09
nipple guess what he does
11:14
my brother would create toys on the
11:15
earth every single christmas he would
11:18
dress to santa claus he would go give
11:19
gifts away he'd visit places to be be
11:22
that person of course the honor of jesus
11:24
christ in his heart more than anything
11:26
else and i want you to know
11:28
nicholas himself loves jesus christ and
11:31
that's why therefore the shirt you know
11:33
here's a shirt right here with santa and
11:36
having doing selfies with jesus
11:41
and so people people just love some
11:43
people live in christmas town i mean
11:45
that's where their mansions are and so
11:47
it's a really fun exciting place to be
11:50
wow that's so awesome i can't wait to go
11:54
and see that myself and all the all the
11:57
kids questions um i asked i even asked
12:00
my daughter this morning i knew i was
12:01
coming on with you and i i said to her
12:03
her name's lily and i said lily if
12:05
there's one question you could ask what
12:07
would you want to ask and she thought
12:09
for a while she had a couple questions
12:11
but um michael could you pull up i i put
12:14
a little video of her asking you uh can
12:17
we pull that up
12:19
hey mrs cat um where where is eva's
12:22
favorite place to go in heaven
12:25
jesus's favorite place to go in heaven
12:28
would be christmas town
12:32
it really is he visits here a lot
12:35
he actually makes toys with nicholas he
12:39
goes to his shop because you have to
12:40
remember
12:42
jesus was a carpenter on the earth uh
12:44
when he actually walked on the earth and
12:47
people go well he built houses he built
12:49
furniture he made toys too
12:51
uh jesus loved children you could see
12:54
all through the new testament that he
12:55
would be with the little children he
12:57
said don't keep them from coming to me
12:59
he loved he loved to talk with him and
13:01
play with them but he would make toys
13:02
for them too so guess what he's using
13:04
his gift he had on the earth in heaven
13:08
he also loves the snow he loves the
13:10
beauty of it
13:11
and everyone loves to see him and they
13:15
all run want to run up and hug jesus and
13:17
guess what they take pictures with him
13:18
in heaven how about that
13:20
uh they do have a way to do that you
13:22
think people are taking pictures down to
13:23
earth where do you get to heaven one day
13:25
so i would say definitely christmas town
13:28
is one of his most favorite places
13:30
oh she's gonna love that um and
13:34
annabelle is eight she's nine years old
13:36
and she wants to know if you paint a
13:38
picture in heaven can you hop right into
13:42
it and does it become real
13:46
that's what i remember some of the
13:47
movies on the years that were made
13:49
people need to understand all those
13:50
great movies the decent fun ones
13:54
a lot of those places are in heaven i'm
13:57
not going to give you a list of some of
13:58
those movies but but we all know that
14:01
there is one that shows something like
14:02
that happen there's so much creativity
14:06
and as i said everything alive is in
14:07
heaven just to give you another idea uh
14:10
there's a whole place called the
14:11
galleria where all the artists come now
14:13
people would think oh you know that
14:14
would be like rembrandt or somebody like
14:17
that no anybody in heaven who has a gift
14:19
you paint or loves to paint there's even
14:22
a whole section for children
14:24
and what they paint does come to life
14:27
now before you think in your natural
14:29
earth head there's nothing wicked
14:32
there's no bad there's no witchcraft no
14:34
darkness no evil none of that is in
14:36
anything anyone does in heaven it
14:38
doesn't even exist there so your
14:40
thoughts your creativity is not ever
14:42
tied to the darkness so you understand
14:44
that but fun excitement you know those
14:48
type of things definitely yes your art
14:50
would come alive but not only does it
14:52
come alive there if you are an artist in
14:55
heaven you have a gallery of your own
14:57
you have a studio that's part of your
14:59
mansion people come to get the art you
15:02
create and you give it away now when
15:04
they take that art home and hang it on
15:06
the wall guess what it comes alive
15:09
oh my god so so she actually thought of
15:13
something that really does happen in
15:16
heaven not just in the galleria area
15:18
where all the artists come but in
15:20
anybody's home they'll come by no matter
15:22
what you create or make that's your gift
15:24
you give it away there's no money
15:26
everything is given freely but how
15:28
delightful for somebody maybe sees a
15:31
magnificent
15:32
horse picture and they take it home and
15:33
hang out and all of a sudden that horse
15:34
is galloping in the picture
15:37
so yes that is exactly true it does come
15:39
alive and not only can you jump into
15:41
your art
15:43
there's a place called cartoon village
15:45
in heaven that he also made for children
15:48
and when you go there you can create
15:49
cartoon of movies with your friends and
15:51
then you become a cartoon and you jump
15:54
in the movie the cartoon and all your
15:56
friends can come and see and watch it
15:58
and when it's over you step back up and
16:00
then you're you again
16:01
so i'm telling you people that think
16:03
kevin is boring they don't know very
16:05
much about it so you were absolutely
16:07
right yes you can jump into your artwork
16:10
and then you're there in the art
16:13
wow oh that's exciting annabelle i know
16:15
you're going to be excited about that so
16:17
think about what you're going to draw
16:19
when you get there annabelle because
16:20
you're going to be able to to be part of
16:22
it
16:23
okay the next question is from
16:25
evangeline and she's four years old and
16:28
she says can i have a rainbow house with
16:31
rainbow things in heaven
16:34
hi evangeline of course you can it is
16:37
heaven
16:38
um mansions are made out of almost
16:41
anything that you can think of but
16:42
totally that rainbow comes from the
16:45
father it's living it moves in and out
16:47
it's on a lot of places in heaven you
16:50
yourself can become rainbow color if you
16:52
want to
16:53
the clothing you wear changes color so
16:56
why wouldn't you be able to have a
16:57
rainbow house i would say yes that would
17:00
definitely be a yes
17:02
oh that's that's exciting my daughter's
17:04
gonna love that too evangeline because
17:06
she always talks about i want to ride on
17:08
the rainbow i want to slide on the
17:10
rainbow and i think i've said in heaven
17:13
i bet you can that's always how i answer
17:15
in heaven you can and then michael is
17:18
age eight this is my son and i asked him
17:21
to ask you a question and he said can i
17:23
have a house made out of candy
17:26
oh no everybody every child wants their
17:30
house made out candy and the best part
17:32
is you can eat it and it comes right
17:34
back uh because it's heaven
17:37
there's a whole place called jello land
17:40
in heaven it really does exist and then
17:42
part of that land of course there's
17:44
there's houses made out of candy they're
17:46
made out of all kinds of things uh
17:49
flowers a whole house made out of
17:50
flowers and they sing to you all the
17:52
time when you come to your mansion and
17:55
uh but candy is one of the most favorite
17:57
things i know there's chocolate
17:58
waterfalls probably would be a part of
18:00
that mansion made out of candy uh you
18:03
can just go jump out in the waterfall
18:04
and drink the chocolate or swim in the
18:06
chocolate and so yes and in the jello
18:09
lamb part of it people will reach out
18:10
and they'll take you know a bite of the
18:12
house or take a handful the house need
18:13
it then it comes right back
18:15
you can bounce in the jello land houses
18:18
also and uh but the candy house i think
18:21
is a great idea it makes me think of
18:22
that game candy land
18:24
so let me tell you i will say this jesus
18:27
christ
18:29
does have a soft part in his heart for
18:32
sweets he loves sweets and so he'd
18:35
probably be right there with you you
18:36
know tasting the chocolate or the candy
18:38
canes or whatever else was made your
18:40
house was made out of so the answer is
18:42
absolutely yes you could have a house
18:44
made out of candy
18:46
oh well he's gonna be really excited
18:48
about that because that is his question
18:49
he's asked me many times cat he said do
18:52
you think i can have a candy house and i
18:54
said well with the lord all things are
18:56
possible so i'm sure yes you can
18:59
yes that's absolutely true
19:01
now we're gonna we're gonna move uh now
19:03
to questions from adults so they're a
19:06
little different than the kids questions
19:08
i have i have noticed that um so the
19:10
first question is from illumination and
19:13
she actually um is behind the scenes
19:16
here and she wants to know my grandma
19:19
went to heaven in 2019 and she
19:21
absolutely loves christmas even her
19:24
memorial service was christmas themed is
19:27
it possible that jesus would give her a
19:29
home in christmas town because she loved
19:31
it so much on earth
19:33
i'm sure he had started building it your
19:36
your mansion gets started being built
19:38
when you're born
19:40
uh when you're born he starts working on
19:42
okay now in heaven there's no time so
19:44
it's not like wow was that 10 years 20
19:46
30 40 50 years
19:48
and usually he times you're coming home
19:50
to heaven with your mansion being done
19:53
so i promise you he already knew what
19:55
she loved you know he sees and hears us
19:57
on the earth i assure you that he had
20:00
already built that house in christmas
20:02
town knowing her love for that so
20:04
if you want to visit her when you get to
20:05
heaven you will be going to christmas
20:07
town probably going on sleigh rides she
20:09
might come to your mention and pick you
20:11
up in the sleigh and then you can go see
20:13
her mansion a lot of that type of things
20:15
happens in heaven so
20:17
i'm sure yes that she lives in christmas
20:20
town
20:21
oh that's awesome well there you go
20:23
elimination she we talked a little bit
20:25
behind the scenes and she said i feel
20:26
like the answer is yes but i i just want
20:28
to hear from cat what what she has to
20:30
say about it so paulette is our next
20:33
question and paulette um asks does
20:36
heaven celebrate jesus's
20:38
earthly birthday
20:40
yes
20:43
can i hold up something you can zoom in
20:45
on it and i'm just gonna show them this
20:47
is a new product not we've already been
20:49
selling about a hundred so it's not
20:51
about buying it but i want to show you
20:53
uh how much they celebrate the birth of
20:56
christ this is a scene i actually saw in
20:58
heaven now this is part of the scene i
21:00
might show you the artwork for the rest
21:02
of it in a minute but this is a scene in
21:04
heaven of a little girl uh who lives in
21:07
heaven and she's riding on a sled with
21:10
the snowman she built
21:12
on the front of the sled actually says
21:14
happy birthday jesus because i had
21:16
already said that everybody celebrates
21:18
the birth of christ in heaven and so
21:20
here they are on their slide you might
21:22
have to tell me if i can can you see it
21:25
yes
21:26
can you see the little the girl the
21:28
snowman her pet
21:31
is also there and there it says at the
21:33
bottom happy birthday jesus
21:36
so yes they do celebrate the birth of
21:39
christ in christmastown
21:41
and uh and everybody loves to come
21:43
there's one of the reasons they actually
21:45
do come there they all sing happy
21:46
birthday to him they have non-stop cake
21:50
people
21:54
was gonna get cake in christmas town and
21:57
hot chocolate you know and
21:59
and other things like that you're
22:00
definitely going to experience that but
22:02
but it is the number one place people
22:04
would think it would be some other place
22:06
maybe religious place but nope this is
22:09
where he chooses and i know people it
22:12
may not have been exactly december 25th
22:14
but he loves for people to celebrate his
22:16
birthday and also created christmas
22:19
towns so people would be able to go
22:20
there to do that
22:21
[Music]
22:22
and in christmas town today is there um
22:25
a big christmas dinner
22:27
uh constance wants to know this and it
22:29
kind of links with the last question is
22:31
there a big christmas dinner in heaven
22:34
for christmas
22:36
and
22:39
why do you um we do it on the earth
22:43
many of the things we actually do and
22:45
the holidays we celebrate they already
22:47
celebrate those in heaven
22:49
and absolutely you're going to eat and
22:52
people can eat all they want to there's
22:53
no weight gain no no allergies no food
22:56
allergies
22:57
and so absolutely how would that be to
22:59
celebrate during that time what what
23:01
represents the time of the year why
23:03
would there not be a feast yes there is
23:06
definitely a big feast the good part is
23:09
this no animals life is taken
23:12
god makes all the food out of light but
23:14
it tastes like turkey it tastes like it
23:17
tastes like ham it tastes like pie
23:18
whatever you love to eat but they
23:21
certainly have a a non an ongoing feast
23:25
in christmas town
23:27
wow that's awesome i can't wait to eat
23:30
in heaven i know i've heard you talk
23:31
about it before
23:33
about how big also isn't the food really
23:36
big in size there oh yes like the pizza
23:39
place that was taken to a place called
23:41
pizza joe's in heaven
23:43
and the pizzas were the size of the
23:46
table it was sitting on now this was a
23:49
round table
23:50
this round table will seat about eight
23:52
people now when i say the word table
23:54
don't think i'm talking about just a
23:55
normal table that's not like that it's
23:58
filled with light and you have like your
24:01
your plate or you can eat on slides out
24:03
in front of you
24:04
and then you just point you you eat a
24:06
slice of pizza it's about this big i
24:08
can't even get it i can't even get it
24:11
the pizza slice is so big you have to
24:14
hold it with both hands to eat it it was
24:16
the best tasting pizza i had ever had in
24:19
my life and right next to that is an
24:21
italian restaurant where the meatballs
24:24
are like
24:25
[Laughter]
24:29
and the guy who the guy who has that he
24:32
had an italian restaurant on the earth
24:34
it was his gift he loved to cook for
24:35
people
24:36
he has a chef's hat on he has one of
24:38
those handlebar mustaches and
24:41
he's really really happy person so yeah
24:43
i've been to like an italian restaurant
24:45
the ice cream parlor oh my goodness the
24:49
the scoops are this big of the ice cream
24:52
and you can even create your own kind of
24:54
ice cream in this ice cream shop and
24:56
then they change and they add a name to
24:58
the um the menu up there what you can
25:01
order and you can you can name the ice
25:02
cream yourself
25:04
wow that's so awesome
25:07
and i know i i love to bake so i'm a big
25:10
baker and i thought when you talked
25:12
about christmas town how the artists
25:14
where um they give away their paintings
25:16
is it the same with bakeries like we can
25:18
make really huge christmas cookies and
25:20
then give them away to all our neighbors
25:23
oh yes you can they'll probably be lined
25:25
up outside
25:29
you can give away your baked goods and i
25:31
know people they say i don't know what
25:33
my gift is and yet oh my word they like
25:35
to make the best brownies on the earth
25:37
and when are you kidding it's going to
25:39
be making brownies you know they love to
25:41
do it they love to give them away as
25:42
gifts
25:44
uh people who are blessed on the earth
25:45
are the ones who who get to operate in
25:47
their gift now
25:49
and so uh they they're used to do that
25:51
but in heaven nobody misses their true
25:53
destiny
25:54
god sent us all as a gift with a gift it
25:58
wasn't not talking about a spiritual
25:59
group talk about a natural gift that
26:01
everybody can enjoy
26:03
and uh and we know people who sing
26:05
they're singing amazing that's their
26:07
gift people in sports they play really
26:08
well that's their gift but there's a lot
26:10
of other gifts gifts there's like design
26:13
you know or baking i can tell you that
26:16
that food and baking and stuff like that
26:18
is considered an art in heaven
26:23
that's awesome
26:24
i can't wait to bake and and i bet the
26:26
the machinery there is like incredible
26:29
too
26:30
like
26:31
huge mixers times 10.
26:34
yes it's incred the thing is is now
26:36
if you want to have a bakery that will
26:39
be part of your mansion you don't have a
26:41
place where you live in a place where
26:42
you work and it's not work when you love
26:45
it right
26:46
so you would go to your mansion to visit
26:48
your bakery and all your good you'd have
26:51
a showroom with all the food there you
26:53
had made and yes they do have kitchens
26:55
in heaven if you want one now if you're
26:58
gonna be a baker you're gonna have to
26:59
have a kitchen you probably have people
27:01
a sign that that's their gift is to help
27:03
in that um unless it's one of the little
27:06
tiny angels that looks sort of like an
27:08
elf and i'm just gonna get bash for that
27:10
but i don't care uh there are ones that
27:12
you have little helpers assigned in
27:14
heaven if you have a bakery because you
27:15
know you know if you got a half a
27:17
million people coming to get your goods
27:18
you need help
27:20
yes
27:21
and so it's a whole different life
27:24
because i've seen the kitchen of someone
27:26
who loved to feed people her dining room
27:29
seated 100 people and it was a dining
27:31
room in her mansion and in her kitchen
27:33
had such high tech i didn't even know
27:36
what some of the stuff was this is one
27:38
of the best parts about heaven if you
27:39
choose to cook i saw this woman making a
27:42
massive salad that was going to be
27:44
served
27:45
to all of her guests and she was peeling
27:47
like a cucumber and as she peeled it in
27:49
the in the and it came off of the
27:51
cucumber it disappeared there's no waste
27:54
there's no trash there's no cleanup how
27:57
about that isn't that awesome hallelujah
28:01
there's no cleanup no garbage to take
28:03
out people there's there's no waste
28:04
dumps and having to leave stuff
28:07
it just disappears and um
28:10
that's like back to the waterfall
28:11
chocolate waterfalls you can get in and
28:13
swim around you have chocolate all over
28:15
you but when you step out of it it's
28:16
gone
28:18
so but the food thing in heaven just
28:20
amazed me that everything you eat is
28:22
made out of life but your substance i
28:24
know people think well light is
28:26
something you can't really touch or feel
28:28
and heaven it is it's the number one
28:30
thing that things are made out of in
28:32
heaven actually your spirit man is made
28:34
out of light but you don't float around
28:36
like a little cloud in heaven you walk
28:38
on the streets you use your stuff in
28:40
your mansion you ride the horses uh it's
28:43
an actual life it's a literal life in
28:46
heaven
28:47
wow that's awesome well i'm excited to
28:50
go and cook in heaven i'm telling you
28:52
that i've had that deep within me where
28:54
i'm like i can't wait to cook and bake
28:56
and give away my stuff in heaven because
28:58
that is your visit your place yes
29:01
please do please everybody come visit me
29:04
please okay
29:05
um
29:06
elaine elaine wants to know can you
29:08
describe how jesus became a seed and was
29:12
planted in the womb of young mary
29:15
that's awesome
29:17
there's actually a story the holy spirit
29:19
told me one time
29:20
it's called twas the year before
29:22
christmas
29:24
and i'm just going to share a little
29:25
part of it i'll probably have it printed
29:27
out later on there but it starts like
29:29
twas the year before christmas when all
29:32
through father's house every creature
29:34
was stirring yes even the mouse
29:37
there was so much activity like uh maybe
29:41
um earth time a year before that when it
29:44
was being announced that the word
29:47
who was christ in heaven the word was
29:49
going to be sent to earth as a baby to
29:52
be raised up to walk among the people
29:55
here
29:56
and then one day would give himself for
29:58
them so
30:00
i don't know if people even think about
30:02
this they think well they're just
30:03
supernatural they just fly around do
30:05
whatever they want to do oh no there's
30:06
much planning in heaven and explaining
30:09
in heaven because you have to understand
30:11
the angels were there long before we
30:14
were put on the earth
30:16
and so there was all kinds of activity
30:18
in heaven all the time they'd be sent on
30:19
assignments places throughout the cosmos
30:22
and
30:23
things so much activity going on in
30:25
heaven
30:26
because people were on the earth you
30:28
know people were living on the earth at
30:29
the time christ was born and so the
30:32
father had to take the word and explain
30:34
to him this is the plan this is the plan
30:38
i have for you
30:39
you will have flesh on you number one
30:41
the word was all spirit but like i
30:43
explained in heaven that's like a whole
30:45
different realm the spiritual realm to a
30:48
spiritual person would be literal like
30:50
i'm touching this like i'm holding this
30:53
cup right here see in heaven if you had
30:55
something to drink uh you would also
30:58
touch the cup and drink out of it even
31:00
though it's a spiritual world uh it
31:03
still had life and activity and there
31:05
was building going on plans being made
31:08
talking about people who had just come
31:09
home to heaven people getting to greet
31:11
them so but heaven does like to have a
31:14
lot of celebrations so this was a
31:16
different time when the father called
31:18
the word to see him and explained to him
31:21
talked to him he said would you be
31:22
willing to do this he asked him we know
31:25
it was it was at that time it was a
31:27
father the word and holy spirit
31:31
and when the father would want to create
31:33
something when there was nothing he
31:35
would go somewhere where there was
31:36
nothing he would speak what he wanted
31:38
the word would step out of him
31:40
and you have to understand in the
31:42
spiritual world the father the father
31:44
son holy spirit can step inside of each
31:46
other that's what makes them one the
31:48
three in one
31:50
so they would go places together and i'm
31:52
thinking the word probably thought oh
31:53
we're going to go create something but
31:55
the father took him aside and explained
31:56
to him it's time now
31:59
for hope to come to the earth
32:02
and therefore my plan is to send you
32:05
as a baby to be a baby on you to be
32:08
raised by a wonderful mom
32:10
and then one day you would grow up and
32:12
then you would give yourself
32:14
for the sins of the world
32:16
and i'm quite sure because i know we
32:18
think well they know everything the
32:20
father really does know everything
32:21
because everything comes from him
32:24
and this was his plan for man to help
32:26
man to help man on the earth they needed
32:28
help okay uh the enemy who satan was
32:31
wreaking havoc everywhere he was just
32:33
getting people to fall into darkness and
32:36
the answer was to send the light of the
32:38
world which was jesus christ so he did
32:40
explain to him he said i will take you
32:43
and i will make you into a seed and holy
32:45
spirit will take you down to the earth
32:47
hover over mary and plant you in the
32:50
womb of mary
32:52
and i know people don't think about this
32:54
too much when they just read the word
32:55
but you should really study the word
32:58
it says in there that he was planted in
33:00
this as a seed in mary and later because
33:03
we know man carries a seed i won't get
33:05
into all that normally the man carries a
33:07
seed and then you get married then you
33:08
have children but this was totally
33:10
different
33:11
uh this was a supernatural divine thing
33:14
that happened that the father
33:16
took the word who was his son made him
33:18
into a seed the holy spirit hovered over
33:20
the womb of mary and even talks about it
33:22
in the bible and then she he was he was
33:24
planted as a seed grew up in mary was
33:28
burst into the earth as a real being he
33:30
had flesh on him okay
33:33
why did he have to have flesh so that
33:34
people could see him because on the
33:37
earth normally you don't see spiritual
33:39
beings unless god opens your eyes to
33:41
that spirit realm which is also all
33:43
around us so he had to explain not only
33:46
to him what he was going to do he had to
33:48
take all the tribes of angels and
33:50
explain to them this is what is going to
33:52
happen
33:53
it's going to be different now it'll be
33:55
different because redemption is coming
33:57
to mankind the word has said yes he's
34:00
willing to do this
34:01
and then he will be known on the earth
34:03
as my son who one day will give himself
34:06
they were totally they were undone
34:09
because this was something that had
34:10
never happened before
34:12
i know when new things happen on the
34:14
earth people think oh that couldn't
34:15
happen or that won't happen but you know
34:17
heaven has been through many things like
34:18
we have there was even there was kind of
34:21
war one time in heaven that was when
34:22
satan tried to take over and he was
34:24
kicked out in a lightning bolt
34:26
uh so they've experienced that all of
34:28
that happening so this was new news even
34:31
for them a new revelation so now the
34:33
word was being sent to the earth
34:35
would be not not recognized on the earth
34:38
because when he was the word he was a
34:39
spiritual body and he's going to have
34:42
flesh on him so he'll look different and
34:44
they could watch from having to see
34:45
everything going on
34:46
so yes on that beautiful morning
34:50
nine months after the holy spirit
34:51
hovered over mary and planted that seed
34:54
uh jesus christ and then he was born
34:57
into this earth such a celebration in
34:59
heaven took place um that the host came
35:02
in saying to the shepherds gabriel came
35:04
to announce his birth
35:06
i'm sure there was quite a sight uh you
35:09
know here on the earth to see this all
35:11
this activity going on it was very major
35:14
for the father to give his son as a gift
35:17
to this world
35:19
and that's why god loves it when we give
35:21
gifts just so you realize
35:23
christmas time on the earth is so
35:25
precious to god it represents us loving
35:27
one another giving gifts to each other
35:30
helping each other you know making a
35:31
difference bringing hope when christ
35:33
came
35:34
as that child he began to bring hope to
35:36
people
35:37
everything was going to change about
35:40
when you pass from this earth you could
35:42
go back home to heaven having received
35:45
christ as your savior so this is one of
35:46
the best gifts ever given to the earth
35:49
would be
35:50
jesus christ the son of the living god
35:52
and he was raised just like you and i
35:55
had to be a little baby learn to walk
35:57
and learn to read and write and i do
36:00
know this about jesus he loved reading
36:03
when he was being schooled on the earth
36:04
he didn't care too much about writing
36:07
and i love the holy spirit he said
36:08
that's why there's only 10 commandments
36:10
instead of 20 because he didn't care too
36:12
much about writing that's a joke in case
36:14
you didn't get it
36:16
so anyway the star coming several years
36:19
before the birth of christ that the wise
36:21
men came across the deserts
36:23
and some people see them in a little
36:25
play here's the three kings they were
36:27
from different countries they saw the
36:30
star of christ in the east so they
36:32
traveled east from the desert regions
36:34
from three different countries it took
36:36
them two years to cross those deserts to
36:39
come and bring the gifts to
36:41
to to jesus and i don't know that he was
36:43
living in the manger at that time they
36:45
did come to honor him recognize who he
36:47
was so even people on in other countries
36:50
knew something special had happened
36:53
and so from that point on jesus lived
36:56
his life walked out his life on this
36:57
earth so that he could become our
37:00
sacrifice and what he was doing was
37:02
making a way back to the father so i
37:05
will say this the day you pass and you
37:08
step out of this body and you're going
37:10
home to heaven jesus will come get you
37:12
he's the one who walks you up the steps
37:14
of the throne and says look father your
37:17
if your son or daughter your son or your
37:19
daughter whichever one is has come home
37:21
to you
37:22
that's part of the blessing that christ
37:25
gets for having given himself for so but
37:28
it was all a stir in heaven all these
37:30
people these these creatures and these
37:33
angels and the host of heaven the army
37:35
they were all talking back and forth
37:36
non-stop did you hear the words going to
37:38
go to earth did you hear he's going to
37:40
be a baby uh that sounds to them that
37:42
was like sort of wild but they knew when
37:44
the father said something it was going
37:46
to happen
37:47
so all of heaven prepared for this to
37:49
happen things were repaired on the earth
37:51
people were put in place there would be
37:54
a part of this whole story of his birth
37:56
how they had to travel they were told
37:58
they had to travel to uh you know be
38:00
accountable for who they were and
38:01
register
38:03
and that happened to be in bethlehem how
38:05
about that and god had already placed
38:07
his star in the heavens to be seen
38:10
uh two years before this happened so
38:12
that's the true story of why we
38:15
celebrate this time of the year is
38:17
because we celebrate the birth of jesus
38:20
christ who came for us because he loved
38:22
us the father loved us
38:25
the holy spirit loved us and this is
38:27
their plan
38:28
for you for i for every person in the
38:30
earth god desires that none should
38:32
perish but you have to choose jesus
38:34
christ to live in this beautiful place
38:36
this world called heaven that is the
38:39
father's house
38:42
that's beautiful when you talk about
38:45
jesus walking us up the stairs back to
38:47
the father
38:50
i mean that
38:51
touches my heart so deeply because it's
38:54
i can just imagine that and the beauty
38:57
of
38:58
seeing the father and just the love that
39:01
must come and
39:03
washed over you as you're with
39:05
jesus and seeing the thought oh i just
39:08
can't wait for that day
39:09
oh you're already undone
39:12
that
39:13
that jesus christ
39:14
is with you
39:16
you hear about him people have
39:18
encounters sometimes i already got the
39:19
spirit of god all over me right now
39:21
you hear stories of people encountering
39:23
him on the earth and i can say i have
39:26
seen him many times but it is never
39:29
normal i'm so undone every time consumed
39:32
by the love that just comes from him it
39:35
it just permeates every part of your
39:37
body and you forget about every care you
39:39
have you're not you're not listening so
39:41
much to all the stuff going on right now
39:43
in this world god has a plan for this
39:45
world okay it says the earth is the
39:48
lord's and the fullness thereof this
39:50
earth belongs to jesus christ he paid a
39:52
price for it and he knows what's going
39:54
on let me tell you there's stuff that's
39:56
going to be exposed i can just say get
39:58
ready for some great great days ahead no
40:00
matter what the enemy thinks they're
40:02
going to do god has a plan to be in some
40:04
of the greatest days if you're young you
40:06
have the most powerful amazing future
40:09
ever on the earth to do great things for
40:11
him the creativity will be so powerful
40:14
and amazing people will be shocked some
40:16
of the stuff will be created on the
40:17
earth to help us our life to be better
40:20
and and happier but the number one thing
40:22
that will happen is the presence of the
40:25
lord is about to consume this whole
40:27
earth and the knowledge of that glory
40:30
will be seen and known all over the
40:31
earth
40:33
hallelujah i feel i feel that so strong
40:36
when you talk about that it's it's going
40:38
to be an awesome time it's awesome time
40:41
to be alive
40:42
uh there was some there's someone who
40:44
asked a question about i wanted to find
40:47
it real quick because they asked about
40:48
the oh the shepherds here we go sally
40:51
asked about um what happened to the
40:54
shepherds to whom the angels appeared
40:57
30 years later did they connect with
41:00
jesus um the baby they had seen or did
41:03
they always wonder what happened to that
41:06
baby have you seen any of those
41:08
shepherds in heaven
41:10
um i'm sure the shepherds made it happen
41:13
i will tell you this they never forgot
41:16
what they saw
41:17
i mean here is one of the one one of the
41:19
archangels appearing and gabriel is
41:21
beautiful he's so glorious i'm sure the
41:24
sky lit up you know the sky open person
41:28
lit up and here he's given this glorious
41:30
announcement you know that this messiah
41:33
is being born the son of god has come to
41:35
be amongst mankind and i can tell you
41:38
that i will say this too that where it
41:40
talks about the great host appeared the
41:42
ones that sang were actually part of the
41:44
army of heaven okay
41:47
and you know it says in the bible that
41:48
the shepherds were afraid they were so
41:50
afraid that their body hurt now they
41:52
weren't going to be hurt but they'd
41:53
never seen anything like this so you can
41:55
imagine warring angels coming with
41:58
gabriel to sing and to glorify christ's
42:00
birth on the earth that's actually what
42:03
actually happened and so they were
42:05
singing i'm sure it was really loud but
42:07
it was beautiful and so you think you
42:10
saw just one angel you'd never forget it
42:12
but here you've seen multitudes of the
42:15
these armies of heaven and gabriel
42:17
and the seraphim probably were there
42:19
singing their heads are like blue fire
42:22
blue fire their hair is so can you
42:24
imagine this site and i know no one has
42:26
been there and has not seen it doesn't
42:28
understand i was taken back and i
42:30
actually saw that scene i saw what
42:32
happened because he was using the army
42:34
of heaven and i'm like no wonder no
42:37
wonder no for me because i see i'm a
42:39
seer i see the army of heaven around me
42:40
all the time i see their activities i
42:42
see them you know battling the army of
42:44
darkness and how badly they get beat
42:47
the army of darkness gets beat but so
42:50
i'm i was accustomed to seeing them but
42:51
seeing the sight
42:53
the shepherds were cowering behind rocks
42:56
or bushes their eyes were so wide you
42:58
know here's gabriel making this
43:00
beautiful announcement and then here
43:01
comes the army to sing in the heavens
43:04
and and it's the lights just like
43:05
blinding from there so you can imagine
43:08
they probably repeated that story over
43:10
and over again to everybody they knew
43:12
probably they probably didn't believe it
43:13
but it didn't matter to them when you
43:15
have an encounter you never forget it so
43:17
i'm quite sure because jesus did teach
43:20
over in that region he taught over there
43:22
there was jerusalem and other places
43:24
there
43:25
i'm sure some of the shepherds probably
43:27
eventually lived in um
43:29
in jerusalem i mean it wasn't that many
43:31
years now he was in there he was already
43:34
known as a great carpenter joseph taught
43:36
him as a master carpenter so jesus was
43:39
known as the carpenter the son of joseph
43:42
but we know he was the son of god
43:44
uh so he was known because of that
43:46
but but when jesus turned
43:49
30 he began his public ministry that
43:51
means he started demonstrating the
43:52
miracles the signs and wonders and i'm
43:55
quite sure it made it back to the ears
43:57
of those because this spread far and
43:59
wide that said i'm sure that some of
44:01
those who were in bethlehem or maybe
44:03
relooking in jerusalem they probably
44:05
knew exactly who that was when he
44:07
started talking about being the son of
44:08
god i i'm quite sure that there are some
44:11
of those shepherds are in heaven yes
44:15
wow that's awesome i i can imagine that
44:18
you went got actually got to go back and
44:20
see that whole entire scene
44:24
that's incredible oh my god i can so if
44:28
when i get to go to heaven can i go to a
44:30
place to watch that scene too
44:33
yes actually there is a place they have
44:35
um they actually have theaters in heaven
44:37
how about that now again i have to
44:39
always explain you don't have to have
44:42
ratings like r for rotten pg like partly
44:45
good g for good
44:47
uh you know i mean they actually they
44:49
they know what goes on here so any of
44:52
the theaters in heaven again there's no
44:54
darkness there's not going to be
44:55
profanity there's no no uh you know
44:58
killings none of that no violence
45:00
whatsoever so there's no dark witchcraft
45:02
none of that is in the theaters in
45:04
heaven but they have a place where you
45:05
can go
45:06
uh and you can actually watch when god
45:09
made when they made the earth you
45:11
actually get to see him creating earth
45:13
by watching it but it's not like a
45:15
screen it's like you're there
45:20
wow
45:21
oh my gosh i can't i cannot wait for
45:24
that um there's another question about
45:27
um renee asked this question and i've
45:29
heard a few people ask this question
45:31
before
45:32
um i'm seeing a lot of christians
45:34
fighting about celebrating or not
45:36
christmas is that a spirit of religion
45:39
trying to stop the celebration of
45:41
christ's birth
45:43
i think it's partly that i think it's
45:45
partly what we've been taught our whole
45:47
lives in church
45:50
you know depending on the church you go
45:51
to because you know there can be 50
45:53
churches to probably hundreds of
45:54
thousands of churches right now
45:56
and i tell you i tell people no matter
45:58
what church you go to make sure they're
46:00
teaching about the validity of jesus
46:02
christ who he is he's the only way to
46:04
heaven
46:04
i think it was that but i think totally
46:06
satan any chance satan god to draw
46:09
people away from the truth
46:12
that's the bottom line satan doesn't
46:14
want people to have fun
46:15
joy celebration but he does not want
46:18
them to have the truth because the truth
46:21
sets you free
46:23
so okay this place in heaven was created
46:26
before the earth was here
46:29
so you can't say
46:31
that christmas is some pagan holiday
46:33
sorry people
46:35
okay the pagans weren't here when god
46:38
made it in heaven however there is
46:40
someone who lived in heaven saw all the
46:42
beauty the wonder and the fun and when
46:44
he was thrown out of heaven he created
46:47
wicked evil things and said that was his
46:50
symbol that was his celebration their
46:52
lies i'm not saying there weren't these
46:55
wicked groups on the earth doing things
46:57
but satan stole different things in
46:59
heaven to make them look like they were
47:01
bad
47:02
so christmas town belongs to god
47:05
he decided to create it no human hands
47:08
made that place because it's a place of
47:10
fun of splendor a place to celebrate his
47:13
son it's in heaven he loves it when we
47:17
celebrate it on the earth and you know
47:20
what you all need to go get can you get
47:22
me the dvd real quick jen i'm going to
47:24
show you really quick a dvd i would
47:26
encourage everyone to get and watch with
47:28
your family it's called saving christmas
47:31
it's right there by kirk cameron
47:33
actually got really tired of listening
47:35
to the very thing you're talking about
47:37
he got tired of all the insults and and
47:40
and dragging you know christmas down
47:42
saying it's a pagan you shouldn't have
47:43
nothing to do with it so he went to the
47:46
word of god got all the scriptures and
47:49
wrote this script for this movie called
47:51
saving christmas it is hilarious but it
47:54
actually shows you nicholas back in the
47:56
time when he walked down the earth where
47:58
that came from and he actually explains
48:01
why christmas is so important on the
48:04
earth
48:04
like i said it's the only time some
48:06
people forgive each other it's the one
48:09
time they reach out and give to help
48:11
others even people they don't know
48:13
and we watch this many times and so i'm
48:15
just going to show you the cover i
48:17
already heard from kirk cameron's people
48:18
saying thank you for showing it
48:20
it explains everything and i think you
48:22
can get it on amazon is that where you
48:24
got it janet amazon so i'm going to
48:26
share with you right now here it is
48:28
it's called saving christmas
48:30
by kirk cameron and he explains why the
48:33
christmas tree is important are the all
48:36
the balls the lights on the tree what
48:38
they represent and you know representing
48:40
christ
48:41
even things like the nutcracker what
48:43
that represents for for heaven for
48:45
heaven on the earth and why do we eat
48:48
why do we celebrate what does all this
48:50
mean
48:51
and he shoots down
48:53
every myth
48:55
or reality of what evil has tried to
48:58
take over he explains it the best of
49:00
anyone i've ever heard so i will
49:02
encourage people get that dvd
49:05
let let yourself watch it with you and
49:07
your in your family it's the best
49:09
explanation i've heard i can just say
49:12
christmas even now people are having
49:14
more hope than they've had in like
49:16
almost two years uh hope is flooding
49:19
joyous flooding through celebration
49:22
i know most people pitch or sell heaven
49:24
is nothing but a place where you bow
49:26
down to god all the time part of the way
49:28
we worship in heaven is enjoying things
49:31
he put there that's our gratefulness for
49:33
what he gave us even in heaven so heaven
49:36
celebrates
49:38
it doesn't have funerals
49:40
there's no funerals there's no firing
49:42
squads there's no death certificates
49:44
being made out no one's crying no one's
49:47
grieving in heaven it is a celebration
49:50
of what christ did for us
49:53
by coming to this earth walking as a man
49:57
showing you the right way to live what
49:59
righteousness is what unrighteousness is
50:01
but i can tell you what there is a
50:03
copycat enemy our true enemy enemy is
50:06
satan i know he uses wicked people to do
50:09
things and then he makes up all these
50:12
occults and all these things i don't
50:14
even understand don't care about because
50:16
i'm not a part of that and i choose not
50:18
to participate or read it or watch it i
50:21
feel myself with the light of god with
50:23
his word what his plans are but i can
50:25
tell you christmas
50:27
has always had the presence of god on it
50:30
when you attend church celebrating the
50:32
birth of christ the choir singing
50:34
represents the angels that sang on the
50:37
day of his birth of some of the most
50:38
glorious songs ever made or created were
50:41
ones about christmas because in those
50:43
songs many of them talk about oh holy
50:45
night
50:46
hearts and heart the herald angels sing
50:49
and so all these beautiful things came
50:51
out of this one beautiful holiday
50:54
it's more than a holiday it's actually a
50:57
way of life that's what it is so yes i
51:00
celebrate it i will celebrate it now i
51:03
will celebrate in heaven one day it
51:05
brings families together but the gift
51:08
giving is one of the big things i know
51:10
man has commercialized it and i'm not
51:12
saying you know go go get a gift for
51:13
somebody it's a wonderful beautiful
51:14
thing to do maybe help the poor with
51:17
something
51:18
you know that's one of my favorite
51:19
things to do also but christmas is dear
51:22
to the father's heart
51:23
he made it
51:25
not a pagan
51:26
not some satanic group
51:28
even satan didn't make it he just tried
51:31
to steal it
51:32
and he lost
51:35
amen
51:36
and what this is a perfect this is a
51:38
perfect question to go along with what
51:40
you just said um there's the user it
51:43
says username because i'm happy they
51:46
asked a question um what can we give
51:48
jesus for his birthday to show him we
51:52
love and honor him i'm gonna move my
51:54
scarf over there yo
51:55
i would say
51:58
he loves cards
52:01
and uh what i do if i want to make a
52:03
card out for jesus i actually make one
52:05
out to him and i put it on my tree
52:07
i mean you don't need to put it even in
52:09
a card you can make him one
52:11
i would say he loves the kids to draw
52:13
pictures you know maybe christmas trees
52:15
or gifts or something like that
52:18
just telling him that you love him thank
52:21
him for coming to earth to be the way to
52:23
make a way back to the father
52:25
he loves it when we sing christmas
52:28
carols especially ones that talk about
52:30
the holy night and away in the manger
52:32
he loves and actually watches many of
52:36
the events put on by churches or groups
52:39
that show that scene back in the way
52:41
back in the day when christ was born and
52:43
they have someone be mary and joseph and
52:45
baby jesus and then they show you know
52:47
if they're really big ones they bring
52:49
live animals in
52:50
but he lost to see the celebration in
52:52
our heart so i would say the best gift
52:55
you could give him would be celebrate
52:57
the holiday
52:58
help people love them and remember why
53:02
we celebrate it
53:03
it is about funny gifts and you know the
53:06
joy but number one it's about a child
53:10
being born in the manger a king the king
53:12
of this world who created everything we
53:15
see and everything we touch and he's
53:17
very much a lie right now excited about
53:21
this time of the year
53:23
so i'd say make a little note telling
53:25
him that drawing a little picture
53:27
hang it on your tree
53:29
if i was a parent i would save those
53:30
somewhere in a special box one day and
53:32
say this is what you did
53:34
to celebrate our king jesus
53:37
oh that's beautiful
53:39
uh there brandon wants to know is there
53:42
spiritual significance when people here
53:45
on earth light up their homes with
53:47
christmas lights do people in heaven
53:49
light up their mansion in a similar
53:51
fashion for the sake of christmas
53:55
they have lights everywhere i can tell
53:57
you if you think that you've been driven
53:59
somewhere where they have a lot of
54:00
decorations and things
54:02
everywhere in christmas town even
54:04
outside of christmas town they all have
54:06
some kind of lights because it's
54:08
celebrating when the angels came and the
54:12
sky lit up with the glory of heaven
54:15
that's actually what those lights
54:16
represent that's what they like they
54:18
represent on your tree on your home
54:20
you're making a statement i celebrate
54:22
the birth of jesus christ i celebrate
54:25
with him in my life that i belong to him
54:29
and i'm recognizing that i'm standing
54:31
with the promises he gave me so i would
54:34
say definitely put lights up
54:36
we put lights everywhere we can
54:38
uh the other thing one more thing in the
54:40
and jesus just said to me now that
54:43
sounds wild he said don't forget the
54:46
cake
54:47
it is celebrating my birthday why not
54:50
make a cake and eat it so i can come and
54:53
see you eating the cake we actually make
54:56
a birthday cake for jesus on christmas
54:58
and at our christmas dinner we have a
55:00
birthday cake for jesus and we sing
55:02
happy birthday to him even though he
55:04
doesn't need to have that done he loves
55:06
it so don't forget to have cake or
55:09
cupcakes or something
55:10
that your children can be a part of and
55:13
celebrate with him
55:15
at a time when he had to change his
55:17
whole life
55:18
and even who he was just to come to this
55:21
earth for us
55:23
so we can sing happy birthday to jesus
55:27
on christmas and
55:28
make that part of our family tradition
55:30
with our kids so that they're always
55:33
raised knowing that it is that's why we
55:35
celebrate that's a great idea to do that
55:38
as a family for all you moms with young
55:40
kids that's a great idea we did that
55:43
growing up and now we still do it even
55:45
now we still do it so definitely you're
55:47
recognizing him you're you're honoring
55:49
him by recognizing him that he is so
55:52
special he's worth making a cake for
55:54
besides like i said he loves sweets i
55:57
didn't get to finish that when jesus was
55:59
growing up as a child he loved honeycomb
56:01
it was his favorite thing it talked
56:03
about it in the bible him and honey but
56:06
john the baptist his cousin also ate
56:08
honey and it was the sweet of that time
56:11
that would be like eating cake you know
56:13
in this day and he still loves sweets
56:16
and every time some new baker comes home
56:18
to heaven he's going to visit their shop
56:20
uh he loves his squeezing
56:23
he'll probably visit you if you make
56:24
sweet sweet
56:27
i was just making a half cake have cake
56:30
and celebrate the birth of christ
56:32
oh that's awesome well we have one i
56:35
think we can get through one more
56:36
question um christine asked my dad went
56:39
to be with god recently and he loved to
56:42
feed god's cardinals
56:45
my dad loved how the snow and the
56:47
cardinals looked would my dad be feeding
56:50
the birds in christmas town or are they
56:52
all over heaven
56:55
birds are all over heaven but i have
56:57
seen i don't know why they just look so
56:59
beautiful people make ornaments with the
57:01
red cardinals and i think i know they're
57:03
around normally other times of the year
57:05
but i just think they're represented if
57:07
you look at i got probably probably 20
57:10
christmas cards at least that had red
57:11
cardinals on them i'm not kidding
57:13
like with the tree with the snow and
57:15
everything in it i'm sure there are
57:18
birds there because the birds come to
57:19
sing happy birthday to jesus too
57:22
and so the birds will come in they'll go
57:24
out they'll come in but i have seen red
57:26
cardinals in heaven uh in christmas town
57:29
and other types of birds too but i'm
57:32
sure that they will be able to see birds
57:34
in that place singing
57:36
to jesus
57:37
oh that's beautiful well thank cat for
57:40
all the
57:41
questions today i mean they were they
57:43
were some awesome questions when i was
57:45
reading through them i was like oh my
57:46
gosh these are all you guys did an
57:48
awesome job sending in christmas time
57:50
questions i enjoyed each and every one
57:53
of them so will you just pray for us
57:56
real quick before we end uh this time
57:58
together and just bless everybody that's
58:00
listening
58:02
sure um i was gonna show one more
58:04
picture
58:05
and this represents sort of like the
58:07
army of heaven coming with gabriel
58:09
making the announcement um this is the
58:11
star right here if you can see if i can
58:14
hold it right i'll put the star you see
58:16
the star or not
58:17
yes
58:19
is it right side up
58:20
yeah there's the star of bethlehem
58:23
there's gabriel making the announcement
58:25
but the army that's with him is not
58:28
normal
58:29
and you can see some of them look like
58:31
creatures and they're singing so the
58:32
shepherds would be down on the ground
58:34
you know trying to go like oh my gosh
58:36
what is that and what is that up there
58:38
in the sky uh whenever it says host uh
58:41
in the bible they're talking about the
58:42
army of heaven
58:43
and so uh yes many of them came to sing
58:46
because you have to remember
58:48
jesus name was the lord of hosts so this
58:51
was his army coming to sing about his
58:54
birth on the earth along with gabriel
58:57
and so i had to show that real quick
58:58
picture but i will pray father i thank
59:01
you right now for blessing everybody in
59:03
this wonderful time this wonderful
59:05
season on the earth god don't let
59:08
legalism and religious mindsets set into
59:11
people that they don't think you should
59:12
celebrate it's not about fun
59:15
it totally has always been about fun the
59:18
sacrifice of your son
59:20
was one part of his life but his birth
59:23
was totally different
59:25
great celebrations were taking place in
59:27
heaven even mary and joseph and those
59:30
who were present with him they were
59:31
celebrating
59:32
and knowing he was the son of god coming
59:34
to this to this earth so father i thank
59:36
you that the reality and the presence of
59:38
jesus christ will flood everyone's home
59:41
everyone's person at this time of the
59:43
year god let love
59:45

59:49
cares you know jesus came to take them
59:52
away
59:53
i thank you for recognizing his birth
59:55
recognizing who he is but also remember
59:58
the celebration part
60:00
that they celebrate in heaven on earth
60:03

60:05

60:14
we're entering into a holy season of the
60:17
glory being released in the earth thank
