the way uh i'm i'm going to say this
01:52
before i forget to make the announcement
01:53

01:55
might forget if i don't say it
01:57
you know we have cats we have questions
01:59
for cat already for today so we don't
02:01
need those uh our staff decided it would
02:03
be great to have you ask any and all
02:05
kinds of questions about christmas
02:08
as it relates to heaven or whatever cat
02:10
knows is seeing understands so ask your
02:13
questions about christmas for next
02:15
week's broadcast most of the
02:18
people put those questions underneath
02:21
the youtube not in the chat to the right
02:22
but underneath uh where you put your
02:24
comments where they stay there not the
02:26
ones that just disappear and roll off
02:28
the screen
02:29
um and there are other ways we get them
02:31
too some people have hit reply and do
02:33
different things that our preferred
02:35
method is below youtube um and we'll try
02:38
and look at other places as well but
02:39
that's we're going to tell you that
02:40
specific one so i want to thank
02:42
everybody for your amazing donations
02:45
yesterday we pretty much had an
02:47
unprecedented number of donations and we
02:49
really appreciate that this ministry is
02:51
really growing by leaps and bounds uh
02:54
after the first we've got several more
02:55
people we'll be bringing on board in
02:57
fact we'll make those announcements at
02:59
the right time just a few of those
03:01
we will announce like this
03:04
i think that some of you have seen
03:05
illumination who now works for us we we
03:08
got her by making the announcement on
03:10
the
03:11
air so we will be making some
03:12
announcements
03:13
uh either next week or after the first
03:15
i'll see what the staff wants to do and
03:17
then people can then begin to send those
03:19
in so we'll figure out how to do that
03:21
and give you an address
03:23
or email whatever the staff wants and
03:25
we'll tell you which positions we're
03:26
looking for so
03:28
but anyway thank you very much for your
03:29
generosity i know it's the as you we
03:32
approach the year end many of you are
03:34
trying to to determine what you want to
03:36
do with your what things you want to do
03:38
with your um final giving for the year
03:40
we certainly appreciate you thinking
03:42
about us you know i've said that we've
03:44
built uh we've dug seven wells in uganda
03:46
and and then we've doubled the size we
03:48
paid for the construction of doubling
03:51
the size of the health clinic
03:53
on in that ugandan village i haven't
03:54
even shown you that picture yet uh we
03:57
have to work we're committed to do 24 to
03:59
dig 24 new wells in and around that
04:02
community and region and some of you who
04:05
saw that video we'll show it several
04:06
more times you saw that the people were
04:09
drinking
04:10
some of them when the water is running
04:12
off of the piglet tree into the water
04:14
that they they put in their drinking
04:15
water and they bring it home it's just a
04:17
horrific thing so we're digging
04:19
freshwater wells thank you so much for
04:21
your i i would say your help you know
04:24
it's not just you helped us you did it
04:26

05:46
next week you probably heard that and we
05:49

05:51
you talked about christmas town all that
05:52
so i'll have you just kind of elaborate
05:54
on that next week so well
05:57
yeah that'll be fun so listen um we'll
06:00
just jump in um before we have any
06:02
questions cat what kind of anything
06:04
current events you'd like to share
06:07
uh
06:08
well i do there are there are things out
06:10
there everybody knows about and things
06:12
people can't know about right now but i
06:14
i can continue to tell you that that
06:17
foundation of the left is crumbling
06:20
um there's other people leaving their
06:22
positions because they're being exposed
06:25
in that is privately
06:27
that i can't announce who that is but
06:30
that big support this is the thing when
06:33
you lose your support like you were
06:35
saying you can't do anything that is
06:36
absolutely true but guess what it's also
06:38
true for the left
06:40
all the people who are jumping on that
06:42
bandwagon are jumping off many of them
06:45
are jumping off some of those are really
06:47
big supporters and i can tell you bottom
06:50
line why i can tell you why they want to
06:52
have money left over
06:54
because they keep being asked for more
06:56
and more and more you can't give
06:57
yourself to something that is totally
07:00
darkness and think they're going to let
07:03
you go how about if i give you that as a
07:05
tip
07:05
you can't do it you can run in
07:07
and agree and participate with things
07:10
that are evil
07:11
and think that will let you go
07:14
i can also tell a story about that there
07:17
are people who were part of an extreme
07:19
dark uh uh thing that was going on this
07:22
is probably maybe 15 years ago
07:24
and they actually had seen demons talk
07:27
to demons and not trying to scare
07:28
anybody they gave permission
07:31
they gave permission and they thought
07:33
what they got to do was exciting and
07:35
amazing but guess what they wouldn't let
07:37
them go they tormented them for the next
07:40
10 years of their life
07:42
and and they just couldn't get rid of
07:44
they didn't get rid of them because you
07:46
can't give yourself to something it's
07:49
like what god says what you enter into
07:52
will enter into you and that's how
07:54
simply something that's one liners of
07:56
some of the most powerful things he ever
07:58
says to me but what you choose to enter
08:00
into will enter into your soul that's
08:02
just what happens and either you think
08:04
about it you want to run after it or
08:06
else you give them a tie to you and
08:08
these people actually gave a tie
08:11
to to this these beings that were um
08:14
beginning to torment them when they were
08:16
done with the fun thing they thought
08:17
they were going to be a part of which
08:18
was dark was really bad i'm not going to
08:20
tell you what that was but they couldn't
08:22
get rid of them finally they had to
08:24
repent
08:25
and and cleanse their soul and every
08:28
every place they lived they had a place
08:30
that the demons would always come in at
08:31
night and torment him they couldn't do
08:33
anything about it
08:34
so they had somebody get hold of me
08:37
i didn't meet with them i told them what
08:39
they would have to do and they could
08:40
never ever go to that place again
08:43
and they would have to just you know
08:45
make sure that they
08:46
got that out of their soul number one
08:48
but they actually had to renounce
08:50
anything or any hold or tie that
08:53
darkness have with them that they gave
08:55
permission to that's the difference and
08:58
people who are just maybe attacked every
09:00
now and then that's it that's illegal
09:02
that's taken to the course of heaven
09:04
sometimes and sometimes god just comes
09:06
in supernaturally and ends that that's
09:09
like an attack this is not what these
09:11
people were doing they willingly
09:13
participated in these evil acts that
09:15
were happening somewhere and that's why
09:18
it took longer to get rid of it they
09:21
finally broke it they have had no no
09:24
nothing else come they stopped coming
09:26
they severed that tie they severed that
09:29
portal that was open by their own
09:31
repentance and then um having to take
09:33
communion over the whole thing and you
09:35
know what they attempted to come back
09:37
but they said they couldn't they served
09:38
only the living god they would not serve
09:41
the enemy again so that's why it's so
09:44
important to make sure you never get
09:46
into one of those places or participate
09:48
like that it's really hard to get rid of
09:50
and that's what people are finding out
09:52
now
09:52
who already have been a part of this
09:54
thing this year and a half long thing
09:56
that's been going on in our country
09:58
more and more people think i can make
10:00
money if i let them use me for this or
10:02
if i lie about this or if i cheat in
10:05
this way i'll make money well they're
10:07
finding out they're losing their money
10:08
that's what's happening they're losing
10:10
their money and once they make a tie or
10:13
a contract with this darkness that's
10:15
going on they won't let you go that's
10:18
why you don't want to participate in the
10:19
beginning you stand strong against
10:21
everything that's going on you keep
10:23
running after god right now in your life
10:26
and don't forget to celebrate he's still
10:28
saying that to me god has already seen
10:30
the beginning to the end he knows
10:32
exactly what will happen and i know
10:34
there's a lot of theories and
10:36
assumptions and people think they know
10:37
what's going to happen i can tell you
10:39
god is going to decide when that does
10:41
happen when it does it will be so great
10:43
you won't have to wonder if you'll hear
10:45
about it so this is just a tip to people
10:47
or those who are still in the darkness
10:49
you better get out while you can if you
10:52
don't you probably will lose everything
10:54
because this is an evil thing happening
10:56
in our country you cannot steal a
10:57
country you cannot give yourself to
10:59
satan or his evil ex and think he will
11:03
let go of you if you're already stepping
11:05
outside of that maybe you never got born
11:07
again you better get bored again really
11:09
quick
11:10
i will say that you better get born
11:11
again because that's probably the one
11:13
thing that can save you from all the
11:15
stuff you've been involved in but
11:17
there's already people they've already
11:18
got some people who are being witnesses
11:20
um to a lot of these accounts that
11:22
excuse me that are happening so i would
11:24
just encourage you and i'm gonna keep
11:26
doing it get out of that darkness while
11:28
you can
11:29
repent make sure you make sure you tell
11:32
somebody who is accountable
11:34
who is an authority in the area that's
11:37
just looking to see what's going on so i
11:40
just want to encourage people those
11:41
things are happening right now people
11:44
are uh they're distancing themselves
11:46
from some people they're actually
11:48
getting out of these things themselves
11:50
but people who have money are finding
11:53
that if something doesn't happen to stop
11:55
this whole thing they themselves will
11:58
have no money or property so let me tell
12:01
you evil will never bless you evil can't
12:04
create life or hope or something that's
12:06
going to help there is no help in evil
12:09
and darkness that comes from god that
12:11
comes from belonging to jesus christ so
12:14
all you who've been out there have been
12:15
strong and stayed strong and given hope
12:18
to people that that god does know what's
12:20
going on don't give up okay you got to
12:22
stay strong it says making your stand
12:24
and standing there for us i just want to
12:26
applaud you
12:28
yeah yeah
12:29
making a great stand for jesus christ
12:33
he made everything we know and see
12:36
nothing is hidden from him so if you
12:38
think because god's not saying anything
12:41
right now to everybody that does not
12:44
mean he doesn't he does have a plan he
12:46
he does he does have a plan for all of
12:48
this that's good ken i think you said
12:50
something a minute ago and i thought you
12:51
know i'm going to ask her to expound on
12:53
that you said people had sold out to
12:55
darkness and you got them into
12:57
repentance and to receiving the lord if
12:59
they hadn't but then you said
13:01
they took communion over that thing or
13:04
something to the that effect and you're
13:06
you're speaking about communion as if
13:08
it's a weapon
13:10
and let me just
13:11
ask you to expand uh expound on the
13:14
weapon of communion what does that
13:16
actually do
13:17
when people take communion
13:19
it is so powerful and
13:22
unfortunately most churches has just
13:24
become a tradition yeah
13:26
i will give you a good example of that i
13:29
remember
13:30
where i was attending at one time it had
13:32
become like a tradition
13:34
that doesn't make god very happy because
13:37
there is power in the blood of jesus
13:39
christ and his surrender totally to the
13:42
father's will and even his own
13:44
willingness to do he didn't have to do
13:47
anything at the cross and no matter what
13:49
people think don't take the crosses off
13:51
your wall now that you think he's not on
13:52
it anymore his own personal mark he
13:55
makes as a carpenter is a cross that's
13:58
what he does even in heaven when he
13:59
makes things that is significant
14:02
it means everything to all those who are
14:04
a believer who have received the the
14:07
sacrifice that christ did and died for
14:09
us he shed his own blood for us that is
14:11
a powerful thing in the spirit it breaks
14:14
things sometimes that nothing else can
14:18
and especially people if they've had
14:20
things going on in their house at night
14:22
maybe they may be familiar spirits or
14:24
other kind of spirits if there's nothing
14:26
else you can do you've prayed maybe
14:28
you've fasted you need to take communion
14:31
yourself over your property and then you
14:33
go outside and you pour some on the land
14:36
and say with the blood of jesus christ i
14:38
redeem this land a shockwave
14:41
of jesus christ will it tell you it will
14:44
embed itself in the property you're
14:46
living on and then you invite holy
14:49
spirit to invade it just invite the
14:51
spirit of god to invade it and let me
14:53
tell you what it'll be hard for anything
14:55
spiritually bad or evil to come on that
14:58
property it would be too painful for
15:00
them
15:00
taking communion is something some
15:03
people actually do every day
15:04
and i do it about once a month myself at
15:07
least sometimes more than that
15:10
and recently we just cleansed our land
15:12
again and let me tell you what the peace
15:15
of god with the presence of god will
15:17
infuse that the presence of god is in
15:19
communion
15:21
it represents many things it represents
15:23
the sec
15:25
reminds us of the sacrifice christ did
15:28
but it's something that brings us
15:30
together if you do that with your family
15:33
it will be so powerful in the spirit it
15:35
brings a bond with you and your family
15:38
together when you take that together
15:40
recognizing together as a family what
15:42
christ did for you
15:44
sometimes it opens things you never
15:46
could get open sometimes it breaks the
15:48
power of the enemy that nothing else
15:50
will break i even tell people who've
15:52
been sick for a long time you should be
15:54
taking communion over your body it says
15:57
very clearly in the bible what you know
16:00
what he did by his stripes what does it
16:03
say
16:04
you are healed okay the blood it helps
16:07
your mind and your mental faculties it
16:10
just does
16:11
physically mentally and emotionally it
16:14
can heal things and break things off of
16:16
you that never could be broken off
16:18
before
16:19
wow
16:20
that's my you know my spiritual father
16:22
wade taylor last five years of his life
16:24
he was my spiritual father he would take
16:27
communion every single day and i believe
16:29
he sometimes several times today his and
16:32
his he believed that the lord had shown
16:34
him that the closest thing we have you
16:36
know the tree of life isn't on the earth
16:38
right now he he strong
16:40
strongly believed that the taking
16:42
communion was the closest thing we had
16:44
to a tree of life on the earth as far as
16:47
the natural
16:48
you know elements that type of thing is
16:50
interesting you know and he was a very
16:51
healthy man until you know finally it
16:53
was his time and suddenly he was gone
16:55
but uh yeah that was i i've never looked
16:57
at communion the same since he since he
16:59
said that because i thought you know
17:01
that what if he's true
17:03
what if it's true that there's so much
17:05
more healing available to us
17:08
there is you know and i remember at
17:10
least i was in at the time that they had
17:12
just did it they were doing it again
17:13
just as a rope thing as a just a normal
17:16
thing they did once a month and god
17:19
yelled from heaven to me it is holy it
17:22
is holy it is holy
17:25
and i'm telling you the presence of god
17:27
fell so strong on me he said you will
17:29
say something about this and
17:32
so i wrote all this down i gave it to uh
17:35
one of the prophets visiting visiting
17:38
and uh
17:39
they read it to the congregation like a
17:41
week later they read it and the power of
17:43
god fell on the entire church and people
17:46
actually got on their knees and repented
17:49
for not taking it for the full uh the
17:51
power of god that was in it the fullness
17:54
of his sacrifices in there well what
17:56
what did he represent he represented
17:58
life hope joy
18:00
healing
18:01
empowerment that's what's in that's
18:04
what's in taking communion that's what
18:06
that means
18:07
that's profound i mean it's just so
18:09
profound yeah when i was raised up but
18:12
i'll get into these questions here when
18:13
i was raised
18:14
in a fundamental church it was like
18:16
every 13 weeks we had a communion they
18:19
even did the foot washing with it and
18:20
all that but it was like if we could
18:22
figure out a way to get out of that
18:24
particular
18:25
uh church service and stay home and once
18:28
in a while we'd figure out something
18:29
like let's go to the beach today it was
18:32
it was just a ritual there was no power
18:35
in it and we just looked for ways to get
18:37
out boy i would never do that
18:39
you know with my
18:40
understanding
18:42
it's very powerful here's
18:44
here's the first question um
18:46
this is a two-part i'll just read them
18:48
both but my mother was in her last days
18:50
in the hospital in hospice she kept
18:52
telling me about these beautiful atriums
18:55
she kept seeing i personally believe god
18:57
was showing her glimpses of heaven
18:59
before she passed so question when are
19:01
there
19:01
atriums in heaven and two does god
19:04
reveal heaven to people in their last
19:07
hours or moments to comfort them or to
19:09
prepare them before they die
19:11
um well that the last part is absolutely
19:14
true some people it's their first
19:17
glimpse of not just having
19:20
many people in their last maybe maybe
19:22
the last week especially they'll begin
19:24
to see family members who are in heaven
19:26
they'll just
19:27
see their faces or something sometimes
19:29
they might hear them say something
19:31
that's not like they're going to abide
19:32
there with them but he is letting them
19:35
have glimpses of having something else
19:37
they'll see many times are their own
19:39
angels
19:40
or or they'll just see angels in the
19:42
room that's really a clue that they're
19:44
probably not going to stay very long
19:46
and but if everything jesus christ
19:49
unless they walk up and he walks up to
19:50
him and say you know you will live and
19:53
not die or it's not your time but
19:55
sometimes he'll catch them up there and
19:57
tell them there and then send them back
19:59
but if if they begin to tell you that
20:01
i've seen jesus then that either means
20:04
they're going to be fully healed or
20:05
they're going to be fully healed by
20:06
going to heaven and uh so yes a lot of
20:09
that happens sometimes you'll give them
20:10
glimpses of mansions in heaven or the
20:12
streets of gold or even the throne
20:15
sometimes so that is absolutely that
20:17
part's absolutely true i think because
20:20
their spiritual body is getting more
20:22
aware
20:23
and um
20:24
even when it gets close to them stepping
20:26
out and they literally step out of their
20:28
body that's what they do if they're
20:30
sitting up naturally they'll just step
20:32
right out of their the physical body
20:34
it'll fall back but there they are right
20:36
there looking at their own body that's
20:38
happened to a lot of people and then
20:39
jesus would say it's not your time so
20:41
they have to go back in
20:42
wow there are many different things that
20:44
could happen some people were here
20:46
heavenly choir saying that part is very
20:48
true
20:49
and uh and i'll tell us i'll talk about
20:51
something else in a minute about the
20:53
choirs but that is true and yes uh even
20:57
sometimes when people are really sick
20:59
maybe they're not terminal they will see
21:01
glimpses of places in heaven and i
21:03
believe the atrium thing that they're
21:04
seeing is probably some beautiful part
21:06
of the gardens of heaven uh there's a
21:09
friendly forest in heaven they have
21:11
beautiful gardens surrounding that
21:13
there's a butterfly there's like this
21:15
beautiful meadow where butterflies are
21:18
uh they actually will sing you hear them
21:20
singing so they could hear a heaven part
21:23
of heaven singing they could see angels
21:24
i could see family members there
21:26
and that does bring peace to them and
21:28
sometimes not just peace some people get
21:30
really excited when they when they have
21:32
glimpses of heaven like that that's
21:34
amazing well that's it's encouraging
21:36
because as i said the number of times my
21:38
mom's real close i'm kind of curious by
21:40
the way regarding that now my mom's
21:43
memory is going we just got back from
21:44
ohio she's got now she doesn't remember
21:47
from conversation to conversation
21:50
a few minutes late does god
21:53
let me ask it this way does god have a
21:54
harder time getting a hold of someone
21:56
like that who needs a little bit more of
21:58
him or does he have an easier time
22:00
because she's
22:02
tuned out of life what would that be
22:04
like
22:05
for her to maybe
22:07
i think it wouldn't matter what state
22:09
they're in mentally emotionally or
22:11
physically
22:13
when he wants to make himself known or
22:15
let them begin many times if we're
22:17
saying they feel no matter where they
22:19
are on their path if they belong to him
22:21
it he already has that connection with
22:24
them in their spirit
22:26
when he's ready to show them something
22:27
he's going to do it but normally that
22:29
will begin to change that person and
22:31
even if they can't remember what they
22:32
ate the day before who visit them the
22:34
day before they normally will not forget
22:36
if they begin to have encounters and
22:39
sometimes it's not like a face-to-face
22:41
encounter sometimes it's his presence uh
22:44
sometimes they they may say oh i feel
22:46
really good right now i i feel amazing i
22:49
feel such peace on me that's usually
22:51
because christ could be in that room
22:54
with them right there in that moment i
22:56
just know that sometimes it might be a
22:57
little bit easier in my thinking if your
23:00
natural mind begins to shut down or your
23:02
memory system the reason for that is
23:05
they can't remember the things that they
23:06
were angry about they can't remember
23:08
things
23:09
you know they can't remember their cares
23:11
they can't remember their concerns they
23:12
don't remember any things that were said
23:14
to them or maybe things that they did
23:16
that they shouldn't have you know maybe
23:18
unkind words that's gone from them so
23:21
that does totally open it up for the
23:24
lord to begin to either speak to them or
23:25
begin to show them things so this that
23:27
might be a good thing well you know it's
23:29
interesting you would say that i wasn't
23:30
going to share this but you know my
23:32
life's an open book right now but you
23:34
know
23:36
what what's that
23:39
you love it it's so open because every
23:40
millions are white i know well we went
23:43
out in march and i i was thinking i was
23:45
being a good dutiful
23:47
obedient loving son to offer her to come
23:51
and live with us from ohio and boy oh
23:53
heck broke liz and i understand this is
23:56
this is really what happens to a lot of
23:58
seniors at this age they if you think
24:03
if they're thinking you're taking their
24:04
blasted i mean she didn't say any bad
24:06
words but she was furious he was
24:09
okay so now fast forward we just can't
24:11
went out there in ohio and we were
24:14
itching her along
24:15
and then she called me after we we got
24:18
back and and
24:20
she's now she's inviting herself to live
24:22
with me instead of the other
24:24
i said i said well mom
24:27
you
24:27
you know after you treated me so
24:30
horribly and she goes what are you
24:31
talking about and she made me repeat it
24:33
five times and she didn't even remember
24:35
after five seconds after i told her she
24:37
said now tell me again what i did then
24:39
we found out later she doesn't even
24:41
remember any of us flying out there
24:43
during march
24:44
yeah that does that actually doesn't
24:48
happen as part of the process of just
24:50
being prepared many times just to just
24:53
to leave
24:54
um but that's normal and you're right
24:56
that's very normal
24:58
and
24:59
even most people when they of course if
25:01
they're still around here around a
25:02
heaven uh a hundred years old you you
25:05
should see some of them some of them are
25:06
sharp as attack but in the natural most
25:09
people's bodies and their systems and
25:11
the way they operate their thinking it
25:14
kind of begins to shut down some uh they
25:16
may be alert in every other way but
25:19
their memory from like the day before
25:21
whatever like she was saying to you that
25:23
might be god's blessing sometimes
25:25
because like you said she didn't
25:26
remember even saying that yeah it feels
25:28
like well i had i had actually been
25:31
again here's that open book thing i was
25:33
really wounded i was hurt and i kind of
25:36
cared that i kept forgetting her in my
25:37
heart all this time after i found out
25:40
yesterday that she has no recollection
25:43
i'm thinking what
25:45
what how what purpose would it be to
25:47
even have any hurt left what have i
25:49
heard about something that she has no
25:51
recollection of ever doing so it's like
25:53
it just fell off it just fell off
26:00
it's almost like
26:01
maybe a child does something not to hurt
26:03
you on purpose but it just happens you
26:05
know
26:06
and uh especially in the different
26:08
growing years they might say something
26:09
hurtful teenagers do that sometimes and
26:12
it it it's part of their growing the
26:15
young on the young side but when they're
26:18
older it's just part of what's natural
26:21
and i think that is i know people who've
26:23
forgotten that went through traumas and
26:25
stuff not not my family of other people
26:27
had horrible traumas when they got
26:29
closer to that age they didn't even
26:30
remember it it's like it just naturally
26:33
left them and they're happy i've also
26:36
known people who like almost couldn't
26:37
stand being around somebody and now they
26:40
love them it's the same
26:42
same people but but they really love
26:44
them because the person who was holding
26:46
that was gone because the memory part
26:48
was gone
26:49
so yes steve you can't you can't hold it
26:51
against somebody who to them like well
26:52
that never happened i would never say
26:54
that
26:55
they mean to you i never said that
26:58
yeah i mean i was smarting and i can't
27:00
you know i was
27:03
you were hurting that hurt
27:07
so anyway that's good all right here we
27:09
go
27:10
he goes i'm i'm finding out that my
27:12
seven-year-old son
27:13
is a seer what is your number one piece
27:15
of advice for a young seer for their
27:17
parents his sister has an autoimmune
27:20
issue and he said that once while we
27:21
were praying for her healing he looked
27:24
up and saw a small angel about four
27:26
inches tall
27:27
with wings wearing a red dress with her
27:29
hand on my daughter's foot praying for
27:32
her would that have been her guardian
27:34
angel that my son saw or a different one
27:37
sent for specific purpose so it's kind
27:39
of a multi-part there that probably
27:41
would be a different one sent for a
27:43
specific purpose but since you brought
27:44
that whole thing up
27:46
i i have known families who had a child
27:49
who was handicapped in some way
27:52
they get extra angels assigned to them
27:54
just because of that what we would call
27:57
a disability uh they get extra ones
27:59
assigned to them
28:00
and this young man now is so almost
28:03
absolutely normal he has some physical
28:05
things not causing him pain but growing
28:07
up they said he wouldn't live they said
28:09
he would never have a normal mind he
28:11
would never be able to talk never feed
28:13
himself and this was being fed to this
28:15
young child's parents like their whole
28:17
life they refused to accept that they
28:19
made sure he had everybody the care that
28:21
he had but they talked to him normal
28:24
they didn't treat him like there's
28:25
something wrong with him and he has two
28:28
angels that are with him all the time
28:29
besides his guardian angel and they're
28:31
there because of this this handicap
28:34
thing he has like i said this is like 30
28:36
years later and you know to see him he's
28:39
so filled with the light of god he's a
28:40
believer
28:42
and he's such a testimony to people
28:44
because of how he has grown in every way
28:46
that the doctor said he wouldn't be
28:47
alive but there were two angels assigned
28:50
to him and i knew somebody else who had
28:53
someone who was grown and they also had
28:56
two other angels and finally i just
28:57
asked holy spirit why are those other
28:59
angels with him
29:01
they looked different than from their
29:02
guardian angels and they said oh they're
29:04
sent to they they like protect the
29:07
anointing that they carry they're there
29:09
just to be uh yeah to bring things down
29:11
from heaven to them that god wants to
29:13
put into them i'm pretty certain that's
29:16
what that four inch angel was that was
29:18
like a little messenger angel bringing
29:20
something down they wouldn't be part of
29:22
the host but they probably were brought
29:24
down from heaven with one of the hosts
29:25
probably brought them down there so that
29:28
was great as far as being a seer
29:30
i would get a journal most important to
29:33
write down things that he's seeing it's
29:35
really important that they do that
29:38
when he gets older he'll be very
29:39
grateful for that journal uh like right
29:41
the day what he said he saw just write
29:44
in his words what he said
29:46
and then anytime he comes i've already
29:48
told some of my
29:50
my daughters to make sure that they do
29:51
that and so one of them has actually
29:53
started cataloging and now this child is
29:56
10
29:57
and he's not stopped seeing things but
29:59
it's very powerful to him that he can
30:01
read about the things he said that he
30:03
heard said or that he saw so definitely
30:07
most important thing you can do is uh no
30:09
matter what god ends up by doing with
30:10
that gift he has
30:12
it will be very powerful one day make
30:14
sure you're writing it down yeah and
30:16
what
30:16
what's the deal with the four inch angel
30:20
versus a seven foot angel i mean
30:22
what would you say about that
30:24
i would say
30:25
possibly whatever it is that the child
30:28
is um whatever it was you said that they
30:30
had it probably there may be like a
30:33
tribe of those little angels like that
30:35
made for that specific thing
30:38
that they were diagnosed with and that
30:40
maybe that may be something that god
30:42
sends maybe his life is in them they're
30:44
they're probably putting the life of god
30:46
in them oh the peace of god in them so
30:49
that would be their only assignment that
30:51
would be what they would be sent for
30:52
probably to keep that child in peace or
30:55
the presence of god yeah i guess the
30:57
issue was it was she just said it was an
30:58
autoimmune issue so she didn't say that
31:01
so
31:01
okay melanie asked how old does god look
31:05
how old would we perceive him to be in
31:07
earthly terms i've heard you describe
31:09
kind of seeing his face but i've also
31:11
heard you describe
31:12
almost a little bit of a veil so i mean
31:14
how do you see him you and i talked on
31:16
the cruise that one time and i said are
31:19
you telling me
31:21
cat that you're sitting down
31:23
sitting down talking face to face with
31:25
the god of the whole cosmos
31:28
and you just like yeah
31:32
you know
31:32
that should be crazy
31:34
it would be like
31:36
asking that question to a child
31:38
that really saw something let's say your
31:40
child went and saw somebody or met
31:42
somebody and you maybe try to convince
31:44
them i don't think you saw them they
31:45
would be so adamant
31:47
uh that the child like part of me
31:50
there's nothing in me that could make up
31:52
anything he wouldn't use me at all if he
31:54
if if i did that i i'm a detailed person
31:57
so i'm always going to see details one
32:00
of the reasons why i see him clearly is
32:02
he chose me because i have a
32:05
photographic memory and i am a detailed
32:07
person like i'm not going to hear just a
32:09
sentence that he says i i'm taking
32:12
places that i have to remember all that
32:14
i saw
32:15
and then they have to write that down if
32:16
it's things that god came and told me
32:18
personally and he said i want you to i
32:21
want you to share this with people then
32:22
i have to remember exactly what he said
32:25
it's not like it becomes um familiar in
32:28
any way i won't even use that term
32:30
because the power uh the power he
32:33
carries i'm sure he has to probably uh
32:36
maybe minimize that a little bit just
32:38
for me to be able to be around him i
32:40
probably i sometimes i feel like
32:42
when i'm when i'm seeing him and it's
32:43
just to be in his presence i feel like
32:45
i'm going to melt and go inside of him i
32:47
don't know how to yeah outs to explain
32:49
that the love that comes from him is so
32:52
powerful and it's it's not just what i
32:55
feel his appearance is
32:57
quite striking if i could say that
33:01
you feel life
33:02
coming from him because it did we all
33:05
lived there so it's like he's holding
33:07
everything in him all of time is in him
33:09
he didn't appear somewhere time came
33:11
from him
33:12
and i know i i love the one-liners he
33:14
tells me to tell people they get their
33:16
heads so undone they try to wrap their
33:18
head around it but most of these things
33:19
are spiritually um discerned
33:22
i would say in his normal appearance
33:25
because i've seen him like a certain way
33:27
many times then there's times i've seen
33:29
him with flames of fire with lightning
33:31
bolts shooting out of him when he's
33:33
walking against the darkness and stuff
33:35
like that his own appearance begins to
33:37
change it talks about the wrath of god
33:41
and any believer you should know this
33:43
that we are not appointed under that
33:45
wrath that he was demonstrating that
33:46
would be evil in darkness and wickedness
33:50
that he despises evil he despise what it
33:53
does to people so if he was gonna catch
33:55
me up there and talk about the justice
33:58
that is coming then his whole appearance
34:00
would be to bring justice that would
34:03
show me that that fierce side of him
34:05
okay
34:06
the loving father side of him which is
34:08
what i see many times
34:10
i know his hair is made out of light
34:12
remember the father is all spiritual but
34:15
he still has the ability to hold me if
34:17
he wants to
34:19
or i can just stand next to him i can
34:22
see into his eyes and usually they're
34:23
like blue flames of fire they're they
34:26
look blue to me blue flames of fire but
34:28
what comes out of him if you could
34:30
picture
34:31
um
34:32
i love the northern lights i've not seen
34:34
them in person but i've seen god
34:37
and that's what that rainbow looks like
34:38
coming out of him if you ever wondered
34:40
it's not a stagnant rainbow it's not
34:42
like you could just paint it around him
34:45
and it would just be there and not have
34:46
life and movement and i would have to
34:48
say seeing the northern lights in the
34:50
way that they move like this coming out
34:53
of him continually and on these
34:56
waves of his rainbow which he it comes
34:59
from him no man made the rainbow people
35:02
it comes from the living god it's part
35:03
of his own appearance and his person and
35:06
out of that comes these little spirits
35:08
of life they'll ride on this rainbow
35:09
then ride back in him that's what you
35:11
used to do when you lived inside god it
35:14
says in him we live we move we have our
35:18
very being the prophets and poets of old
35:20
have spoken of these things what things
35:22
when they were shown that
35:25
way in the past god would show himself
35:26
to people sometimes and sometimes it was
35:29
someone who was a poet and they actually
35:30
wrote poems about that
35:32
and so one of those made it in the word
35:34
of god so that's just a part of him to
35:37
see him like that the creative side
35:40
where i would see jesus step out of the
35:42
father and the father would say
35:44
something and then he would make what he
35:47
said that's why he was called the word
35:50
we know in the book of john it says that
35:53
we know in the book of john when john
35:54
said
35:56
the word was with god
35:59
and was god and there was nothing that
36:01
was made that was not made by him
36:04
that was jesus christ that's who he the
36:07
word came to the earth and died uh as
36:10
the son of god and so they're one and
36:13
the same the word jesus christ are the
36:15
same but when he was the word he only
36:17
had a spiritual body he was all spirit
36:20
it was still a body i know in your mind
36:22
you can't imagine you think of something
36:24
like a little like a spirit like
36:26
whatever you want to call it like the
36:28
spirit of a person or something they're
36:30
much more there's much more to them than
36:32
just some little wispy thing if you're
36:35
in a spirit world which heaven is and
36:38
everyone there in the spiritual body
36:40
they look solid in that world okay so
36:43
when i see the father most of the time
36:45
he looks like he's solid although he's
36:47
all spirit so i've seen him with love
36:50
coming out that consumes like the whole
36:52
army of god before they're going to go
36:54
somewhere um to bring justice for him
36:57
over someone on the earth he'll
36:59
literally go and just stand in their
37:00
midst and every one of them will be
37:03
permeated with his love he loves them
37:05
too
37:06
and his love and and just empowerment
37:09
and and when you see that he's he is
37:12
kind
37:13
and he is good and many people don't see
37:16
the father is good but jesus himself
37:18
said there's none good but the father
37:21
and so when you see there's many
37:23
different parts of him sides of him
37:25
uh that's who he is but
37:27
i i'm always undone
37:30
when he comes most of the time
37:32
unannounced
37:33
because what is on his heart to share
37:35
i'm i'm his revelator that's what he
37:37
calls me that means i reveal for him
37:41
i don't reveal for a man so i'm not
37:43
gonna usually i can answer questions ask
37:45
me if i've been told or shown it
37:47
otherwise i can't answer that i can't
37:49
answer for him if i haven't been shown
37:51
or told something
37:54
so it's really quite undone sometimes
37:56
the room i'm in like where i sleep which
37:59
is in my office built this moment
38:01
there's a huge portal in that room and
38:04
and sometimes he would come down through
38:06
that portal but sometimes most likely in
38:08
the hotel room a lot of times he'll just
38:10
walk through the wall like it's not
38:12
there and he'll begin to tell me stuff
38:14
sometimes he'll tell me to write it down
38:16
sometimes he'll write on the wall
38:18
and we know that even in the word of god
38:20
it talks about him doing these things so
38:22
for him
38:23
those are normal things he does when he
38:25
when he knows somebody who's going to
38:27
tell the truth who will not embellish on
38:29
what he
38:31
what he said which is extremely
38:33
significant even john the baptist had
38:36
one of the greatest revelations ever
38:37
given on the earth that's why they said
38:39
he's the greatest prophet of all that's
38:41
why that's in there he announced
38:43
literally
38:44
here is the son of god he actually got
38:47
to say that even though in the natural
38:48
he was jesus's cousin when he spoke
38:51
those words he wasn't speaking from a
38:53
natural viewpoint he was speaking from a
38:55
divine point and he never changed as
38:57
much as that he came that he came to say
39:00
that you had to repent of your sins
39:01
right he was one of the first ones to
39:03
give that message so what he said was so
39:06
powerful when he actually said here he
39:08
is
39:09
uh the the first and only person on the
39:11
earth who could actually say here's
39:13
jesus christ the son of the living god
39:15
this is the messiah that was a powerful
39:17
word but he never changed what he said
39:19
because that's what god told him to say
39:22
wow yeah and you've always been obedient
39:24
that way you know almost to a
39:26
frustrating point because people will
39:27
ask you something i've seen it even on
39:29
um
39:30
what's the kenneth copeland channel i
39:32
can't think of any victory channel or
39:33
whatever and flashpoint and they'll try
39:35
to get you to answer a question you'll
39:37
say i can only tell you what god told me
39:39
and then he'll launch into your
39:41
prophecy that was that's pretty i've
39:43
learned learned a good way um also
39:45
that's part of that same question is
39:47
does god the father does he look like a
39:50
grandpa does he look like a dad who's
39:52
older what what age
39:54
impression when he leaves well i know
39:56
you're wanting most people will judge
39:58
somebody by their skin
39:59
okay or conditioning is a skin and does
40:01
it have wrinkles does it not have
40:03
wrinkles does it have like brown spots
40:07
and most people judge people nor in the
40:10
natural you know um if they have white
40:12
hair no hair
40:14
i mean i i can't answer him in that
40:17
context i cannot put him in a category
40:20
as a human i know that i see life in him
40:23
i see still even now talking you can
40:26
still see his face
40:28
very clearly and it's filled with life
40:31
there's no age in him he's never going
40:34
to age his hair is white it's alive his
40:38
hair on his head is living it's not
40:40
short hair it's down below his shoulders
40:43
uh he has this amazing uh wonderful
40:46
beard
40:47
um
40:48
it just you know i can't i tell people
40:50
say what do you think he looks like
40:51
kenny rogers he doesn't look like a
40:53
human
40:56
everyone fails in comparison to him
40:59
because of the stuff he carries that
41:02
makes him who he is
41:04
but i can just say that you will you'll
41:06
never regret giving yourself to his son
41:09
that is the one where you are assured of
41:11
meeting him in person
41:13
he's excited about seeing you he cannot
41:15
wait for you to get back home to heaven
41:18
and i hope this gives you a glimpse of
41:20
the other side of dying for you you're
41:22
losing something for him he's gaining
41:24
something he's gaining his son or his
41:27
daughter back to himself he is so
41:30
excited all of heaven celebrates when
41:32
they come home so for them there's
41:35
there's there's no loss in their mind uh
41:38
from the time they step out of the
41:39
spiritual body they're stepping right
41:41
there they feel his presence they see
41:43
their angels their excitement floods
41:46
them you know i mean it's not like they
41:48
don't love you to actually love you even
41:49
more
41:50
but but just to be in his presence i
41:53
understand why jesus when he had to live
41:55
on the earth he'd go away to the
41:56
mountains to to be with his father he
41:58
would go away to go be that he needed it
42:00
after living here with humans are you
42:02
kidding
42:03
and so king himself
42:05
loves the father and i think for him the
42:08
greatest thing he gets to do is take us
42:10
back to him when you come home to heaven
42:12
he walks you up the steps of god's
42:15
throne the father's throne and gives you
42:18
back to him he says
42:20
your son your daughter they've come home
42:22
and let me tell you the celebration will
42:24
start in heaven at that time but but he
42:27
is not little he's not a little person
42:29
in any way whatsoever but this is what i
42:32
love about the father one of the
42:33
greatest things i like to say about him
42:35
is he could be a hundred feet tall two
42:37
thousand feet tall whatever he wants to
42:39
be he can be that size i think sitting
42:42
on the throne many times and to me he
42:44
would look like maybe i don't know 10 15
42:46
feet high he he doesn't want to make
42:48
himself invisible to you if you're
42:50
coming home to meet him but i've seen
42:52
him holding the earth in his hands so i
42:54
hope you get this picture i've seen him
42:57
back in time when he was making the
42:59
earth holding it in his hand this is the
43:02
father when the word would step out he'd
43:05
make it gave it to the father the father
43:07
began to speak over the earth itself
43:10
he would pour water from himself he's
43:12
going to put the water on the earth he
43:14
poured from his own south the river of
43:16
the river of life that comes from him he
43:19
poured that in as the ocean on the earth
43:23
and so whatever they did they did
43:24
together and so i've seen him that big
43:27
to hold the earth in his hand
43:32
i've seen him be you know make himself
43:36
well call enormous eyes just to hold you
43:38
he'll stand up on the throne and hold
43:39
you to himself
43:41
and i also know this about him that even
43:44
though he's on the throne
43:46
he himself can make himself
43:49
not leaving the throne
43:51
small enough to step inside of himself
43:54
to play with all the little spirits of
43:56
life that's who you were are you serious
43:59
with you in himself while he's sitting
44:02
on the throne people he knows what's
44:04
going on
44:06
if you think he's willing to give this
44:09
earth that he loved that he spoke over
44:12
to evil what do you think he didn't have
44:14
and he kicked it out it got unseated
44:18
lost his place lost his authority lost
44:21
his power
44:22
lucifer did you think he's changed his
44:25
mind about that because he has not
44:28
he loves you too much and this time is
44:32
too important for him to give it over to
44:34
evil all i know is they're going to lay
44:36
down roll over and beg god for mercy
44:40
when those days of justice fall upon
44:42
them and for some of them it will be too
44:45
late
44:47
wow wow catboy the anointing hit you
44:49
right there god came
44:51
god came down wow
44:53
wildcat
44:54
cat let me can i explore a little bit
44:56
you talk about the son loves the fat
44:58
father loves his son and son loves the
44:59
father i think we've talked about this a
45:01
little bit let me
45:03
drill down you know when i was raised up
45:04
we'd always make sure we pray in the
45:06
name of jesus make sure you say the name
45:08
of jesus and it became like a
45:10
a formulaic word make sure you mention
45:13
the name of jesus because then god can
45:15
has to do it but but is there something
45:18
in when we pray in the name of jesus
45:21
that we should at that moment
45:24
almost tap into how much the father
45:26
loves jesus
45:28
as we're saying that as opposed to just
45:30
making sure you pronounce jesus or
45:33
yeshua what
45:35
what is that go ahead and understand who
45:38
you're talking about when you use this
45:40
name
45:41
uh and if if there's probably if you're
45:44
saying it just from head knowledge this
45:46
is what you want to know don't ever say
45:48
his name from head knowledge
45:50
okay you need to say it from revelation
45:54
like what i just spoke okay that's how
45:57
you should feel every time you say his
45:59
name for any purpose you're having power
46:03
in that name of jesus that's why it is
46:05
one of your greatest weapons the name of
46:07
the name of christ okay his name his
46:10
blood uh his sacrifice his revelation of
46:14
who he is he right now he right now is
46:17
the king of glory people uh he has many
46:21
other titles besides jesus christ when
46:24
you talk about him as your savior and
46:26
what he did for you he also gave you
46:28
power over all the power of the enemy he
46:33
gave us three things you see him from
46:34
that viewpoint it should almost be like
46:38
a threat to hell that you are saying the
46:41
name of jesus christ
46:43
wow wow
46:45
yeah that's a whole lot different
46:47
well that's what the lord's been showing
46:48
me lately is is to tap into to that to
46:53
him to the reality
46:54
um
46:56
yeah and this one you kind of answered
46:58
this this is the next question but you
46:59
kind of addressed this
47:01
it says before jesus came to the earth
47:02
and he was called the word in heaven did
47:05
his spiritual body then look like
47:08
what we know as his human body or what
47:10
we think of as his human body or was his
47:12
body more like i don't know what i don't
47:14
know what this means was his body more
47:16
like the holy spirit i i think this
47:18
person's grasping between um
47:22
a cloud like the holy spirit or the body
47:24
of jesus but i i think they both have
47:27
um
47:28
a
47:29
spiritual butt right
47:32
yeah i would say when you are you
47:34
talking about let me get the timing
47:36
right are they talking about what jesus
47:37
looked like when he stepped out of his
47:39
physical body let me see when jesus came
47:41
to the earth and he was called the word
47:44
in heaven he was called the word did his
47:46
spiritual body then in heaven
47:50
look the same as his human body looked
47:52
on earth
47:54
oh when he was the word did it look the
47:56
same as the physical body on earth that
47:59
seemed to be the question no physical
48:00
body changed him from what he looked
48:03
like
48:05
because if it looked just like the word
48:07
why did not satan recognize him oh good
48:11
point oh good point he did not know when
48:14
he took him to the mountain temptation
48:15
that was the son of the living god he
48:18
didn't know that he was trying to find
48:19
out who he was
48:22
he was always pursuing who is he until
48:25
he himself said who he was he did not
48:28
know
48:29
he did not know he was the word that was
48:31
with god the word was all spiritual body
48:34
that was his divine body a spiritual
48:37
body a spiritual body like we were just
48:39
talking about isn't a wispy cloud i know
48:41
what they're talking about you're
48:43
talking about what they've seen on tv or
48:44
movies this little wispy thing steps out
48:46
they can go through walls and the reason
48:48
why uh your spiritual body down here
48:50
could walk through a wall is that
48:52
physical wall is a temporary substance
48:56
it's even a temporary realm the physical
48:59
realm is not the original realm the
49:01
spiritual realm where the whole world
49:03
called heaven was created where tribes
49:06
of angels were made where you go back
49:08
home to live in that place you don't
49:10
pass to the walls in heaven and your
49:12
spiritual body okay you have substance
49:15
in your spiritual body but as far as the
49:18
appearance thing the word was very
49:20
powerful he could go in and out wherever
49:23
he wanted to do whatever he wanted to he
49:25
had no flesh attached to him the other
49:28
sacrifice you don't realize he made was
49:31
he was willing not just to walk and live
49:34
in a physical body he had to keep the
49:36
physical body wow and so when your
49:39
little spirit person leaves god when you
49:42
lived in god you didn't look like
49:44
this okay you had a little appearance
49:47
you had a face you little face you had
49:48
body you could play inside of god and
49:50
the river of life climbed the mountain
49:51
that's in him a ride in and out on the
49:54
waves of the rainbow you could do those
49:56
things in your little spiritual body but
49:59
you didn't look
50:00
this gave you an identity okay that's
50:03
one of the reasons why he wanted you to
50:05
have a fleshly body number one so you
50:07
could live in this physical body in this
50:10
physical world and do things for him
50:12
here
50:13
but as opposed to the word the word look
50:16
different than jesus christ did because
50:19
the flesh wrapped around your spiritual
50:21
body
50:22
your spiritual body actually adapts to
50:26
the flesh
50:27
because when your throat man steps out
50:29
of this body when mine does
50:32
it looks the same as if i was in my
50:34
fleshly body except
50:37
i look a whole lot younger and so were
50:40
you one day so know that satan did not
50:43
recognize
50:45
who jesus christ was he didn't know he
50:47
was the word okay who made him actually
50:51
uh satan was created he's a created
50:53
being
50:54
he didn't know that that was the word he
50:56
didn't know at all
50:58
and that that was part of the bushwhack
51:00
people so that was part of the butch
51:02
whack that jesus would almost have a
51:04
disguise that satan wouldn't recognize
51:07
for a very long time jesus could do
51:09
things he wanted to say what he wanted
51:11
to and
51:12
and satan i'm sure was quite shocked
51:15
when jesus christ you know
51:17
living on the earth began to cast demons
51:20
out of things that really freaked him
51:21
out i'm really sure
51:23
now he said okay this person's got power
51:25
he's got power i i don't didn't know he
51:27
had this power uh
51:30
and he's not really as brilliant as he
51:32
wants people to think he is because when
51:34
he got kicked out the heaven part of his
51:35
mind was seared by that lightning bolt
51:38
i'm just letting you know so he did not
51:40
know that that jesus christ was the word
51:43
of god because jesus himself with his
51:46
fleshly body looked different than the
51:49
word and right now he still looks like
51:51
jesus christ who lived and walked on the
51:53
earth except for this
51:55
he has his glorified body already he was
51:58
glorified that body was glorified when
52:00
he stepped up from hell came up from
52:02
hell and stepped into that physical body
52:04
that was dead laying on that slab
52:07
life infused it but not just life but
52:09
the glory of god infused the body of
52:12
jesus christ and he walks around now in
52:13
his physical glorified body
52:16
in heaven so when he comes to see me
52:18
that's that's who i see is the one in
52:20
the glorified body and you know when you
52:22
said uh this is the first time it ever
52:24
clicked that we would have looked
52:26
different inside the father because we
52:28
would only look like we looked down
52:30
because i'm a combination of my mother
52:32
and my father that's
52:34
the appearance i took on
52:36
that's right because i had a natural
52:38
mother father so i don't look totally
52:40
different in heaven before god selected
52:42
the family for me i guess yes
52:45
he knew all along
52:47
he knew you would be looking like just
52:49
like you do now steve
52:51
he knew everybody would be looking like
52:52
that like they do right now in their
52:54
physical body he knew
52:56
when you were in him you were chosen
52:59
at that point for some things in your
53:01
life he put a little mark on you he knew
53:04
i would be a prophet he knew you would
53:06
make a home for the prophets to come and
53:08
say whatever god wanted to say he knew
53:10
that we probably knew each other we
53:12
probably were friends inside of him that
53:14
would be cool to know that would be
53:16
really interesting you think so we
53:18
wouldn't
53:18
be doing so because
53:20
i know
53:21
those who were friends inside of god if
53:23
he chose you to be a part of your
53:25
lifetime
53:27
uh in a significant way he would
53:30
absolutely choose people that kids that
53:32
you were like call them kids they all
53:34
little they're all little at all like a
53:36
bunch of little kids living in him and
53:38
and you had i would see little kids
53:40
sometimes with little groups playing
53:42
with each other and doing things with
53:43
each other and we we can have a whole
53:46
whole just segment about life and god uh
53:49
really that would be quite fascinating
53:51
to find out revelation about what did
53:53
you do in there what went on there what
53:54
does it look like and there's another
53:56
whole thing
53:57
but i'm pretty sure that we probably
53:59
were friends i know my husband and i
54:02
were friends when we were we were part
54:04
of this the little group that we had
54:06
uh inside god that we played there's
54:08
millions inside of him but
54:10
there's no back to god there's no size
54:13
to god it's like inside of him he's part
54:16
of infinity
54:17
and that at one time you know before he
54:19
made the earth we all everyone who ever
54:21
was or will be lived in him you can
54:24
imagine in your head let's hope you
54:26
maybe that makes you realize how
54:27
powerful he is about who he is uh he is
54:30
limitless in his understanding and his
54:32
knowledge and in his revelation he's
54:35
unlimited in almost every way he's
54:37
unlimited can i ask you a a difficult
54:41
question
54:42
that some watching will even um
54:45
it would be their question it would be
54:47
their question
54:49
god knew you before you were born he
54:51
knew what you would look like before you
54:52
were born and then there are people who
54:55
are product of of either
54:58
born out of wedlock in some cases rape
55:01
how do you what do you say to people who
55:03
say but what about me how could god have
55:05
known me
55:07
and allowed me to either have
55:10
children of abuse or
55:12
what do you say about the plan of god
55:14
and what
55:15
sometimes we're allowed to go through
55:17
in this life
55:19
i think one day
55:21
when you get your book given to you that
55:23
was written about you in heaven you'll
55:24
understand that he didn't choose any of
55:27
the evil stuff at all that wasn't had
55:29
nothing to do with god at all he sent us
55:31
to this earth it's an imperfect earth
55:33
there's imperfect people
55:35
everybody is held accountable for what
55:37
they did they they there there will be
55:39
an accountability uh of course when you
55:42
receive jesus christ that has something
55:44
to do with wiping that away
55:46
but i can tell you this he sent you this
55:48
is what happened he picked you for
55:50
certain things he sent you to earth at
55:53
the time he needed you to be here
55:56
he didn't choose those people to be
55:58
wicked they weren't always wicked when
55:59
they were children they weren't wicked
56:01
okay so everybody making their own
56:03
choices are raising their children
56:06
in a certain way because of what's in
56:08
them
56:09
and that's why i always i talk to young
56:11
people a lot i've done young people
56:13
meetings and i say you have to
56:14
understand that you're not just going to
56:17
be raising children one day you are
56:19
shaping souls
56:21
that came from god for his use do not be
56:24
abusive i'm i'm telling them this
56:26
already but you know what that's if they
56:28
watch a lot of violent stuff
56:30
just go into their soul and even
56:32
psychiatrists know this they don't
56:34
understand the workings of the soul or
56:36
what the soul looks like but what you
56:38
what you choose what you listen to all
56:41
the time will become a part of you what
56:43
you watch all the time would become a
56:44
part of me and eventually you might even
56:46
act out some of those things you see
56:49
and that's why there's evil satan helps
56:51
that to happen he makes sure it happen
56:54
happens and yet there's some people who
56:56
grew up in a violent household
56:59
that that never part part took of that
57:01
they they were strong they never allowed
57:03
that to affect their life or how they
57:06
lived it later and became and were
57:08
totally totally different people than
57:10
what that person was that had them so
57:12
you have to understand god didn't create
57:15
he didn't make evil happen
57:17
he didn't even make lucifer satan
57:20
if you go back that far let's go that
57:22
far he may lucifer to be an anointed
57:25
being who would help lead worship
57:27
for him to create glory for him to be a
57:30
light for him that's what that's what
57:33
lucifer's job was he made him for that
57:36
he didn't make him to be evil it says in
57:38
the bible iniquity was found in him
57:42
that was significantly because god
57:44
didn't put that in him
57:46
okay by his own thoughts by lucifer's
57:49
own thoughts and own
57:50
wicked desires to be greater than god
57:53
and want to rule
57:55
from that came evil began to be birthed
57:58
inside of him before it came out so
58:00
because there is evil
58:03
present in this world one day there
58:05
won't be any
58:07
we can look at it that way but god
58:09
didn't choose you to be tormented he
58:12
didn't choose that those people who
58:15
raised you had every right to choose to
58:17
do what was right regardless of what
58:19
within them they had every right to be
58:22
kind to you to nourish you
58:24
to nurture you and everything and know
58:26
god and no happiness and joy
58:29
and not have your mind tormented later
58:31
in your life all the things that
58:32
happened to you as a child but god
58:33
didn't create evil
58:35
in this earth
58:37
he didn't know evil would be here but he
58:40
also sent his son for the very purpose
58:42
that you could be free from anything
58:44
you went through you can be free from
58:46
any event no matter how bad it was or
58:48
when it happened you don't have to carry
58:50
that stuff on the inside of you
58:52
and that's why he came to bring freedom
58:54
in life he had an appointed time to be
58:57
here even jesus christ had to be made
59:00
into a seed this is what it says christ
59:03
was made into a seed he was made okay he
59:06
had he was going to have flesh on him
59:08
and i think on my our next um report we
59:11
do i'll actually read the poem holy
59:13
spirit gave me
59:14
about when the announcements began to
59:16
made it be made in heaven that the word
59:18
would die for us that the word would be
59:20
made flesh which it says in the bible
59:24
he was planted as a seed in the womb of
59:26
mary but there's this whole beautiful
59:28
story
59:29
it's called the year before christmas
59:32
and what literally began to happen in
59:34
heaven um you know before he was even
59:36
sent
59:37
and i'm not going to do that today but
59:39
we'll do that next week but you have to
59:41
understand god has been from the
59:42
beginning to the end and no matter what
59:44
you thought you could do that would be
59:46
better
59:48
he
59:49
has a plan
59:51
he was willing to sacrifice his own son
59:53
who was tormented and tortured and so
59:56
horribly abused wrongfully accused uh
59:59
you know unjustly treated
60:02
and and basically murdered
60:05
he knew that
60:06
his son would go through that but what
60:08
comes from that and this is the thing
60:11
you even though it's not god's intention
60:13
to make you suffer for him his son
60:16
suffered for all of us
60:18
you can take your life no matter what
60:20
you've been through and you can lose all
60:21
of that all of that horror all of that
60:23
abuse all that torment all that trauma
60:26
lucifer from your soul in jesus name and
60:28
jesus will come pull it out of you
60:30
and it will be like it didn't happen in
60:33
other words you might think about it but
60:34
there'll be no torment in it there'll be
60:36
no suffering in it
60:38
because we can be totally free
60:41
from all of the effects of evil but god
60:43
didn't make people bad he didn't make
60:46
evil itself
60:48
and the evil one who's done this will be
60:51
more tormented than anything that ever
60:53
existed throughout all the time he satan
60:57
will be more tormented than any other
60:59
anyone else who ends up in that lake of
61:01
fire
61:02
satan will be the most hated being in
61:04
there the most tormented and he will
61:06
have no
61:08
power whatsoever so you can think of
61:11
it's one thing you to be in a place of
61:14
torment but when you everyone is
61:16
tormenting that one person and they
61:17
can't escape or get away uh that is his
61:20
end he will have nothing from anything
61:23
he's done god also knows that he's a
61:26
just god
61:27
and kind loving god so you need to see
61:30
him the kind loving one who gave the
61:32
greatest sacrifice i know i'm not trying
61:35
to cover up things that were done to you
61:37
my parents didn't torment me uh but i
61:40
certainly was picked on and and made fun
61:42
of most of my life growing up and i just
61:45
had to let it go i don't even know about
61:46
losing you know i decided i'm going to
61:47
let it go and go on i have stuff i have
61:50
to do and i want to see done
61:54
you have to make the same decision but
61:55
let me tell you god does know everything
61:58
and he is not it is seedtime and harvest
62:01
people this is not
62:03
don't get your 50 bottles of anointing
62:05
oil out okay because this is not the end
62:08
time harvest it talks about in the bible
62:10
before all the other stuff start to
62:12
happen we're not even ready to handle
62:14
that harvest like that okay you're going
62:16
to be powerful you're going to be filled
62:18
with god when those days come but it's a
62:21
seedtime and harvest for what you've
62:23
been planting what the left has been
62:25
planting harvest for them is about to
62:28
happen what you've been planting by
62:30
yours making a stand still filled with
62:33
life encouraging people bringing people
62:35
hope you're going to get the greatest
62:36
harvest you've seen in your life so far
62:39
this is the seedtime and harvest is
62:40
happening now just that's for free what
62:43
time is it time and harvest for us
62:46
individually for whole groups of people
62:48
if it's evil you're going to get a
62:50
harvest of justice and and probably the
62:53
rather that and
62:54
while
62:55
while you're talking
62:57
as this as we close out i know i feel
62:59
like there's some people out there that
63:00
says i wish someone would just show me
63:03
right now how to get saved i i like this
63:06
stuff
63:07
no one's ever led me to the lord how do
63:09
i do that would you
63:11
i sure would love to do that yeah
63:14
and and let me tell you it's really
63:16
uh man can come
63:18
complicate things so much sometimes we
63:21
feel like we don't read you know the the
63:23
50-page syllabus
63:25
or if we don't have someone who's like
63:27
known god forever lead you even a child
63:30
can lead someone to be born again you
63:32
make a decision in your own self that
63:35
you want jesus christ okay
63:37
you're tired of what you've been living
63:39
in you're tired of the junk going on in
63:40
this world you see no hope if you don't
63:43
have hope right now
63:44
you may not have a lot of god in you
63:47
because right now he's releasing hope in
63:49
life when you are born again
63:52
literally your your soul gets a shower
63:55
of the blood of jesus christ to wipe
63:57
away every sin you've ever committed no
64:00
matter what it is when it happened in
64:03
your life if you want to walk as
64:05
righteous if you don't have jesus christ
64:07
you're unrighteous okay you're not
64:08
counted as righteous if you want to be
64:10
counted as righteous you're going to be
64:12
part of god's plan what he has in this
64:14
earth you need to know his son jesus
64:16
christ
64:17
you first of all recognize that jesus
64:19
christ is the son of the living god he
64:22
did die for your sins and he did it
64:24
purposefully he chose to do that so the
64:27
first thing you do is repent of any sin
64:29
you've ever committed no matter when it
64:31
happened or how that happened re repent
64:34
recognize that you are a sinner and you
64:36
repent and you receive jesus christ as
64:38
your savior that's the first step that
64:41
you do that the second step is you thank
64:44
him for dying for you thank him for your
64:46
sins being forgiven and it will be like
64:50
in god's books in heaven when you
64:52
receive christ he literally will go and
64:54
wipe out in his books every sin up to
64:58
that point every one you've ever
64:59
committed will be wiped off like you
65:01
never did them that's how powerful the
65:04
blood of christ is
65:06
then you say i receive everything that
65:08
that blood affords me i receive
65:09
everything that that sacrifice that
65:12
affords me i realize now i'm part of
65:14
god's family i'm a part of his family
65:17
i'm not a i'm not an old sinner set free
65:20
by grace you are a powerful born again
65:24
uh believer now jesus christ will
65:26
literally step inside of you that's what
65:28
happens he'll step inside of you
65:31
it says you invite him to live in you
65:33
and he will and then you begin to feel
65:36
his presence
65:38
miraculous things will begin to happen
65:39
because now you're carrying his presence
65:42
with you and anytime temptation comes to
65:44
you after that make sure you say no i'm
65:46
not that person anymore it says you're
65:49
born again you are a new creation and
65:52
the reason why god can say that is none
65:54
of your past sins you're not being
65:56
looked at anymore by a sinful person
65:59
you're being looked at as god's son or
66:01
his daughter whichever one he made you
66:04
and now he opens doors for you to
66:07
understand him more make sure you get a
66:08
bible i would encourage you to start
66:11
reading the new testament read the book
66:12
of john and make sure you study the book
66:14
of john as a lot about who jesus was
66:17
also talks about what what it's like to
66:19
be born again and in in there it's real
66:22
exciting and then make sure you speak to
66:24
him you need to know that prayer is very
66:27
important for you you don't just get you
66:28
know born again and now i'm saved and
66:31
live your life like he always lived it
66:33
i'm not saying you can't stay at the
66:34
same job or live in the same home you'll
66:36
have the same family but you need to
66:38
recognize now you're a new creation made
66:41
by god because of the blood of christ
66:43
you begin to seek him and what does that
66:45
mean get in a room by yourself and say
66:47
jesus christ i want to know you more i
66:49
want i want to know you i want to know
66:51
what your heart is i want to know what
66:53
your thoughts are of me and i would say
66:55
i i used to do it at one point every day
66:57
of my life i did that usually late at
66:59
night i'm not saying you have to do
67:00
anything late at night and this is the
67:02
thing some people say you have to take a
67:04
certain posture it's okay if you want to
67:06
kneel to do it you can be walking down
67:08
the street and get born again you can
67:10
get born again arriving in your car he's
67:12
looking to know you more he is seeking
67:15
you harder than you are seeking him
67:19
so the most important thing in your life
67:21
should be to receive christ and then
67:23
begin to pursue to know him more and
67:26
then you start on a whole different
67:29
journey
67:30
in your life the inside of you has
67:32
changed your spirit man god puts light
67:34
in your spirit your spirit man has light
67:37
in it it gives it more understanding it
67:39
gives you more of his presence inside of
67:41
you
67:42
your name is literally written in the
67:44
lamb's book of life he'll write it right
67:46
there at that moment that you get born
67:48
again and so powerful things happen in
67:50
the spirit when you are born again so i
67:53
would just say just you can say a simple
67:54
prayer so let's just say this you can
67:56
say
67:57
jesus christ
67:59
jesus christ
68:01
i want to receive you as my savior i
68:04
want to receive you as my savior
68:06
i recognize
68:08
we recognize
68:10
you are the son of the living god you
68:13
are the son of the living god
68:15
you came to this world to die for my
68:18
sins you came to this world to die for
68:20
my sins
68:21
so i repent of all sin so i repent of
68:24
all sin
68:26
up to this moment in my life up to this
68:28
moment in my life
68:30
i ask you to wash me clean i ask you to
68:33
wash me clean
68:35
with your blood with your blood
68:38
i receive your sacrifice i receive your
68:41
sacrifice
68:43
and i now thank you and i now thank you
68:46
for making me part of the family of god
68:49
for making me part of the family of god
68:52
i give you permission i give you
68:54

03:14
hearing all about christmas town um but
03:17
before we start do you have any current
03:19
events that you want to share with us
03:22
i just want to say some of the greatest
03:24
things ever about to happen people
03:27
um you know i can share but not share
03:29
all of it i just know that things are
03:31
rumbling
03:32
in the undergrounds not just the
03:34
earthquakes but uh behind the scenes and
03:38
then covert places the solicitor's
03:40
covert
03:42
i can just tell you the new norm will be
03:44
better than what it was before people
03:46
it's not gonna we're not gonna be
03:47
controlled it's not gonna be a time of
03:49
sorrows we are not entering into the
03:52
perilous times we have way too much
03:54
stuff to do in this earth for jesus
03:55
christ and of course you know this show
03:58
highlights him also but it highlights
04:01
one of his best friends in heaven his
04:02
name would be nicholas so that's about
04:05
it let's just get going with those
04:06
questions
04:07
yes awesome so the first the first thing
04:11
i want you to just tell like a brief um
04:14
a little bit about what where christmas
04:16
tower is and what is christmas town for
04:18
the people who haven't heard you talk
04:20
about it before
04:21
christmas town is actually a place in
04:24
heaven
04:25
and for those who don't know me um
04:27
you you may not be able to
04:29
wrap your natural mind around anything
04:31
that i say because it comes by
04:33
revelation
04:34
revelation comes from the heart of the
04:36
father it's not man's thoughts man's
04:38
ideas are man's plans
04:40
it's god's and so i've been taking on
04:44
tours of heaven not just once but many
04:46
times and before you start you know
04:48
beating me up i forgive you i forgive
04:50
everybody out there so don't waste your
04:52
time doing that i have too much of a
04:54
life to live for jesus christ
04:56
but i do want to say this years ago
05:00
kenneth hagin senior has somebody
05:02
working for him who actually still on
05:03
this earth her name is billy brim
05:06
and um and he would tell billy brim
05:09
before these days are over
05:11
uh things that will begin to happen he
05:14
said i won't be here this kenneth hagin
05:15
senior speaking to billy brim who worked
05:17
for him okay
05:19
and uh and he said to her before these
05:21
days are all over something great will
05:23
begin to happen god will begin to catch
05:26
people up to heaven and taking them on
05:27
tours
05:29
really those are his words and then
05:31
bringing them back to earth this is
05:33
without dying so they can share
05:35
revelation about heaven and that he said
05:37
that to billy brim and when she found
05:40
out about me she was so excited she
05:42
called me i sent her my first book i
05:44
think i sent her the second book too and
05:47
she said she knew this was true because
05:49
years ago kenneth hagin senior who's now
05:51
in heaven uh had told her this would
05:54
happen and she saw that i was taken on
05:56
tours continually she knew that was the
05:58
truth so there's somebody right there
06:00
who's an eyewitness
06:01
that god had this plane all along i just
06:04
happened to be one of those people i've
06:06
been taking in many places in heaven
06:07
over the last 20 some years and i was
06:10
taken to exciting profound places that
06:13
were so filled with awe and wonder but
06:16
has also taken places to have fun
06:20
and the father said to me why would i
06:22
not have fun if i said in my word you
06:24
know you must come like a little child
06:27
he said i'd be in a lot of trouble if i
06:28
didn't have fun places for people who
06:30
are like little kids to play in and one
06:33
of the places i was taken to
06:36
is a place in heaven where it snows all
06:38
the time now i know a lot of people are
06:40
going to love this more will love it
06:42
than not
06:43
it snows all the time but you have to
06:45
remember i'm talking about heaven not
06:47
the earth the snow is alive
06:50
everything in heaven has life the plants
06:53
sing the plants talk the birds the
06:55
creatures even the buildings shout out
06:58
the ground shouts out all the time and
07:00
worships jesus christ they have a place
07:02
called the friendly forest you can go
07:03
and have conversations with trees with
07:05
the rocks uh with the creatures there's
07:08
so much life there you can't escape it
07:09
so i hope that under makes you
07:11
understand
07:12
in in christmas time when you go there
07:14
that is where nicholas lives
07:17
yes nick some people call him saint nick
07:19
some people come saying you call them
07:20
whatever his actual name is nicholas and
07:23
god created a place he knew one day so
07:27
this place has been around don't go into
07:29
the druids and all the stuff that it's a
07:31
bad place and it's part of this thing
07:33
this thing i'm sorry but god was there
07:35
heaven was there before anybody was born
07:37
on the earth he had places already
07:40
planned in heaven that he knew that we
07:42
would love to come there and he knew
07:44
people would come home and use their
07:45
gifts in heaven which is what you do
07:48
so nicholas had a place all prepared for
07:51
him when he passed to come nicholas
07:54
lived in the 3rd century i think 270 a.d
07:57
that's really close you know it's only
07:59
270 years after christ died so everybody
08:02
was still talking about him knew about
08:04
him in those days but of course you know
08:06
our enemy satan wasn't happy about that
08:08
so he'd always send people out into the
08:10
crowds into places to talk against
08:13
the deity and the person of jesus christ
08:16
so nicholas was actually this is the
08:18
person who people then made him become
08:20
like santa claus he actually was a very
08:23
wealthy person he lived in turkey you
08:25
can look all this up even i think
08:26
wikipedia talks about it he lived in
08:29
turkey and uh he would offender of the
08:31
faith and i think he was even a bishop
08:34
but he was very fierce when people would
08:36
attack the person of jesus christ or
08:38
speak against who he was
08:40
he had a staff he would use that staff
08:42
for things other than leading his sleigh
08:45
how about that people he actually had a
08:47
sleigh he would take gifts to children
08:50
he used to set them outside their home
08:52
at that certain time of the year and
08:54
then thieves would begin to come by and
08:56
get it so he is the one who actually
08:58
started the whole stocking thing the
09:00
parents would hang stockings inside and
09:02
nicholas would come by and leave gifts
09:04
for them this is the truth i'm telling
09:06
you and so all that came the wonderful
09:09
story we have now but i do want to say
09:12
this he lives there he loves the snow
09:14
it's known where he lived on earth
09:16
and so god created this beautiful place
09:18
when you make a snowman in christmas
09:20
town in heaven it is alive so i kind of
09:23
want some of the christmas songs and the
09:25
things that they say
09:27
uh your sleigh can go through through
09:29
the air it can go on the ground uh
09:31
there's all kinds of things to enjoy
09:33
there ice skating and i i learned from
09:36
the father that our seasons on the earth
09:40
are here there's four main seasons
09:42
and we know that there's winter summer
09:44
spring and fall
09:46
and god said i took a a shadow of an
09:49
actual place
09:51
that existed in heaven i took a shadow
09:53
of it and made it a season on the earth
09:56
so that's one of the reasons why we have
09:58
snow on the earth because it is in
10:00
heaven it was there first and so he made
10:02
this beautiful place it's like this
10:04
beautiful village and everybody goes
10:06
there with their families who are in
10:08
heaven and yes everybody gives gifts but
10:11
then excuse me the main thing they do in
10:13
christmas town is they celebrate the
10:16
birth of jesus christ
10:18
it's like happy birthday all the time in
10:20
heaven because people go to there to see
10:22
sometimes jesus will show up and people
10:24
will bring him gifts they pile gifts
10:26
gifts you know at a place for him
10:28
but they get gifts before they leave
10:30
christmas town because they're huge
10:32
trees in christmas town and all the
10:35
lights on the trees are baby stars
10:38
like that he plucked out of the sky put
10:40
them on the trees and they all sing
10:42
worship music to jesus but they also
10:44
sing christmas songs
10:46
so this is a delightful place that the
10:49
kids will love to go but even big kids
10:51
you know parents and whole families go
10:53
to this beautiful place and they really
10:56
enjoy it
10:57
so that's where nicholas lives he made
10:59
this place where nicholas has a shop
11:03
he still makes toys
11:04
and my brother recently passed and he
11:06
used to say all the time when i get to
11:08
heaven one day i'll work with saint
11:09
nipple guess what he does
11:14
my brother would create toys on the
11:15
earth every single christmas he would
11:18
dress to santa claus he would go give
11:19
gifts away he'd visit places to be be
11:22
that person of course the honor of jesus
11:24
christ in his heart more than anything
11:26
else and i want you to know
11:28
nicholas himself loves jesus christ and
11:31
that's why therefore the shirt you know
11:33
here's a shirt right here with santa and
11:36
having doing selfies with jesus
11:41
and so people people just love some
11:43
people live in christmas town i mean
11:45
that's where their mansions are and so
11:47
it's a really fun exciting place to be
11:50
wow that's so awesome i can't wait to go
11:54
and see that myself and all the all the
11:57
kids questions um i asked i even asked
12:00
my daughter this morning i knew i was
12:01
coming on with you and i i said to her
12:03
her name's lily and i said lily if
12:05
there's one question you could ask what
12:07
would you want to ask and she thought
12:09
for a while she had a couple questions
12:11
but um michael could you pull up i i put
12:14
a little video of her asking you uh can
12:17
we pull that up
12:19
hey mrs cat um where where is eva's
12:22
favorite place to go in heaven
12:25
jesus's favorite place to go in heaven
12:28
would be christmas town
12:32
it really is he visits here a lot
12:35
he actually makes toys with nicholas he
12:39
goes to his shop because you have to
12:40
remember
12:42
jesus was a carpenter on the earth uh
12:44
when he actually walked on the earth and
12:47
people go well he built houses he built
12:49
furniture he made toys too
12:51
uh jesus loved children you could see
12:54
all through the new testament that he
12:55
would be with the little children he
12:57
said don't keep them from coming to me
12:59
he loved he loved to talk with him and
13:01
play with them but he would make toys
13:02
for them too so guess what he's using
13:04
his gift he had on the earth in heaven
13:08
he also loves the snow he loves the
13:10
beauty of it
13:11
and everyone loves to see him and they
13:15
all run want to run up and hug jesus and
13:17
guess what they take pictures with him
13:18
in heaven how about that
13:20
uh they do have a way to do that you
13:22
think people are taking pictures down to
13:23
earth where do you get to heaven one day
13:25
so i would say definitely christmas town
13:28
is one of his most favorite places
13:30
oh she's gonna love that um and
13:34
annabelle is eight she's nine years old
13:36
and she wants to know if you paint a
13:38
picture in heaven can you hop right into
13:42
it and does it become real
13:46
that's what i remember some of the
13:47
movies on the years that were made
13:49
people need to understand all those
13:50
great movies the decent fun ones
13:54
a lot of those places are in heaven i'm
13:57
not going to give you a list of some of
13:58
those movies but but we all know that
14:01
there is one that shows something like
14:02
that happen there's so much creativity
14:06
and as i said everything alive is in
14:07
heaven just to give you another idea uh
14:10
there's a whole place called the
14:11
galleria where all the artists come now
14:13
people would think oh you know that
14:14
would be like rembrandt or somebody like
14:17
that no anybody in heaven who has a gift
14:19
you paint or loves to paint there's even
14:22
a whole section for children
14:24
and what they paint does come to life
14:27
now before you think in your natural
14:29
earth head there's nothing wicked
14:32
there's no bad there's no witchcraft no
14:34
darkness no evil none of that is in
14:36
anything anyone does in heaven it
14:38
doesn't even exist there so your
14:40
thoughts your creativity is not ever
14:42
tied to the darkness so you understand
14:44
that but fun excitement you know those
14:48
type of things definitely yes your art
14:50
would come alive but not only does it
14:52
come alive there if you are an artist in
14:55
heaven you have a gallery of your own
14:57
you have a studio that's part of your
14:59
mansion people come to get the art you
15:02
create and you give it away now when
15:04
they take that art home and hang it on
15:06
the wall guess what it comes alive
15:09
oh my god so so she actually thought of
15:13
something that really does happen in
15:16
heaven not just in the galleria area
15:18
where all the artists come but in
15:20
anybody's home they'll come by no matter
15:22
what you create or make that's your gift
15:24
you give it away there's no money
15:26
everything is given freely but how
15:28
delightful for somebody maybe sees a
15:31
magnificent
15:32
horse picture and they take it home and
15:33
hang out and all of a sudden that horse
15:34
is galloping in the picture
15:37
so yes that is exactly true it does come
15:39
alive and not only can you jump into
15:41
your art
15:43
there's a place called cartoon village
15:45
in heaven that he also made for children
15:48
and when you go there you can create
15:49
cartoon of movies with your friends and
15:51
then you become a cartoon and you jump
15:54
in the movie the cartoon and all your
15:56
friends can come and see and watch it
15:58
and when it's over you step back up and
16:00
then you're you again
16:01
so i'm telling you people that think
16:03
kevin is boring they don't know very
16:05
much about it so you were absolutely
16:07
right yes you can jump into your artwork
16:10
and then you're there in the art
16:13
wow oh that's exciting annabelle i know
16:15
you're going to be excited about that so
16:17
think about what you're going to draw
16:19
when you get there annabelle because
16:20
you're going to be able to to be part of
16:22
it
16:23
okay the next question is from
16:25
evangeline and she's four years old and
16:28
she says can i have a rainbow house with
16:31
rainbow things in heaven
16:34
hi evangeline of course you can it is
16:37
heaven
16:38
um mansions are made out of almost
16:41
anything that you can think of but
16:42
totally that rainbow comes from the
16:45
father it's living it moves in and out
16:47
it's on a lot of places in heaven you
16:50
yourself can become rainbow color if you
16:52
want to
16:53
the clothing you wear changes color so
16:56
why wouldn't you be able to have a
16:57
rainbow house i would say yes that would
17:00
definitely be a yes
17:02
oh that's that's exciting my daughter's
17:04
gonna love that too evangeline because
17:06
she always talks about i want to ride on
17:08
the rainbow i want to slide on the
17:10
rainbow and i think i've said in heaven
17:13
i bet you can that's always how i answer
17:15
in heaven you can and then michael is
17:18
age eight this is my son and i asked him
17:21
to ask you a question and he said can i
17:23
have a house made out of candy
17:26
oh no everybody every child wants their
17:30
house made out candy and the best part
17:32
is you can eat it and it comes right
17:34
back uh because it's heaven
17:37
there's a whole place called jello land
17:40
in heaven it really does exist and then
17:42
part of that land of course there's
17:44
there's houses made out of candy they're
17:46
made out of all kinds of things uh
17:49
flowers a whole house made out of
17:50
flowers and they sing to you all the
17:52
time when you come to your mansion and
17:55
uh but candy is one of the most favorite
17:57
things i know there's chocolate
17:58
waterfalls probably would be a part of
18:00
that mansion made out of candy uh you
18:03
can just go jump out in the waterfall
18:04
and drink the chocolate or swim in the
18:06
chocolate and so yes and in the jello
18:09
lamb part of it people will reach out
18:10
and they'll take you know a bite of the
18:12
house or take a handful the house need
18:13
it then it comes right back
18:15
you can bounce in the jello land houses
18:18
also and uh but the candy house i think
18:21
is a great idea it makes me think of
18:22
that game candy land
18:24
so let me tell you i will say this jesus
18:27
christ
18:29
does have a soft part in his heart for
18:32
sweets he loves sweets and so he'd
18:35
probably be right there with you you
18:36
know tasting the chocolate or the candy
18:38
canes or whatever else was made your
18:40
house was made out of so the answer is
18:42
absolutely yes you could have a house
18:44
made out of candy
18:46
oh well he's gonna be really excited
18:48
about that because that is his question
18:49
he's asked me many times cat he said do
18:52
you think i can have a candy house and i
18:54
said well with the lord all things are
18:56
possible so i'm sure yes you can
18:59
yes that's absolutely true
19:01
now we're gonna we're gonna move uh now
19:03
to questions from adults so they're a
19:06
little different than the kids questions
19:08
i have i have noticed that um so the
19:10
first question is from illumination and
19:13
she actually um is behind the scenes
19:16
here and she wants to know my grandma
19:19
went to heaven in 2019 and she
19:21
absolutely loves christmas even her
19:24
memorial service was christmas themed is
19:27
it possible that jesus would give her a
19:29
home in christmas town because she loved
19:31
it so much on earth
19:33
i'm sure he had started building it your
19:36
your mansion gets started being built
19:38
when you're born
19:40
uh when you're born he starts working on
19:42
okay now in heaven there's no time so
19:44
it's not like wow was that 10 years 20
19:46
30 40 50 years
19:48
and usually he times you're coming home
19:50
to heaven with your mansion being done
19:53
so i promise you he already knew what
19:55
she loved you know he sees and hears us
19:57
on the earth i assure you that he had
20:00
already built that house in christmas
20:02
town knowing her love for that so
20:04
if you want to visit her when you get to
20:05
heaven you will be going to christmas
20:07
town probably going on sleigh rides she
20:09
might come to your mention and pick you
20:11
up in the sleigh and then you can go see
20:13
her mansion a lot of that type of things
20:15
happens in heaven so
20:17
i'm sure yes that she lives in christmas
20:20
town
20:21
oh that's awesome well there you go
20:23
elimination she we talked a little bit
20:25
behind the scenes and she said i feel
20:26
like the answer is yes but i i just want
20:28
to hear from cat what what she has to
20:30
say about it so paulette is our next
20:33
question and paulette um asks does
20:36
heaven celebrate jesus's
20:38
earthly birthday
20:40
yes
20:43
can i hold up something you can zoom in
20:45
on it and i'm just gonna show them this
20:47
is a new product not we've already been
20:49
selling about a hundred so it's not
20:51
about buying it but i want to show you
20:53
uh how much they celebrate the birth of
20:56
christ this is a scene i actually saw in
20:58
heaven now this is part of the scene i
21:00
might show you the artwork for the rest
21:02
of it in a minute but this is a scene in
21:04
heaven of a little girl uh who lives in
21:07
heaven and she's riding on a sled with
21:10
the snowman she built
21:12
on the front of the sled actually says
21:14
happy birthday jesus because i had
21:16
already said that everybody celebrates
21:18
the birth of christ in heaven and so
21:20
here they are on their slide you might
21:22
have to tell me if i can can you see it
21:25
yes
21:26
can you see the little the girl the
21:28
snowman her pet
21:31
is also there and there it says at the
21:33
bottom happy birthday jesus
21:36
so yes they do celebrate the birth of
21:39
christ in christmastown
21:41
and uh and everybody loves to come
21:43
there's one of the reasons they actually
21:45
do come there they all sing happy
21:46
birthday to him they have non-stop cake
21:50
people
21:54
was gonna get cake in christmas town and
21:57
hot chocolate you know and
21:59
and other things like that you're
22:00
definitely going to experience that but
22:02
but it is the number one place people
22:04
would think it would be some other place
22:06
maybe religious place but nope this is
22:09
where he chooses and i know people it
22:12
may not have been exactly december 25th
22:14
but he loves for people to celebrate his
22:16
birthday and also created christmas
22:19
towns so people would be able to go
22:20
there to do that
22:21
[Music]
22:22
and in christmas town today is there um
22:25
a big christmas dinner
22:27
uh constance wants to know this and it
22:29
kind of links with the last question is
22:31
there a big christmas dinner in heaven
22:34
for christmas
22:36
and
22:39
why do you um we do it on the earth
22:43
many of the things we actually do and
22:45
the holidays we celebrate they already
22:47
celebrate those in heaven
22:49
and absolutely you're going to eat and
22:52
people can eat all they want to there's
22:53
no weight gain no no allergies no food
22:56
allergies
22:57
and so absolutely how would that be to
22:59
celebrate during that time what what
23:01
represents the time of the year why
23:03
would there not be a feast yes there is
23:06
definitely a big feast the good part is
23:09
this no animals life is taken
23:12
god makes all the food out of light but
23:14
it tastes like turkey it tastes like it
23:17
tastes like ham it tastes like pie
23:18
whatever you love to eat but they
23:21
certainly have a a non an ongoing feast
23:25
in christmas town
23:27
wow that's awesome i can't wait to eat
23:30
in heaven i know i've heard you talk
23:31
about it before
23:33
about how big also isn't the food really
23:36
big in size there oh yes like the pizza
23:39
place that was taken to a place called
23:41
pizza joe's in heaven
23:43
and the pizzas were the size of the
23:46
table it was sitting on now this was a
23:49
round table
23:50
this round table will seat about eight
23:52
people now when i say the word table
23:54
don't think i'm talking about just a
23:55
normal table that's not like that it's
23:58
filled with light and you have like your
24:01
your plate or you can eat on slides out
24:03
in front of you
24:04
and then you just point you you eat a
24:06
slice of pizza it's about this big i
24:08
can't even get it i can't even get it
24:11
the pizza slice is so big you have to
24:14
hold it with both hands to eat it it was
24:16
the best tasting pizza i had ever had in
24:19
my life and right next to that is an
24:21
italian restaurant where the meatballs
24:24
are like
24:25
[Laughter]
24:29
and the guy who the guy who has that he
24:32
had an italian restaurant on the earth
24:34
it was his gift he loved to cook for
24:35
people
24:36
he has a chef's hat on he has one of
24:38
those handlebar mustaches and
24:41
he's really really happy person so yeah
24:43
i've been to like an italian restaurant
24:45
the ice cream parlor oh my goodness the
24:49
the scoops are this big of the ice cream
24:52
and you can even create your own kind of
24:54
ice cream in this ice cream shop and
24:56
then they change and they add a name to
24:58
the um the menu up there what you can
25:01
order and you can you can name the ice
25:02
cream yourself
25:04
wow that's so awesome
25:07
and i know i i love to bake so i'm a big
25:10
baker and i thought when you talked
25:12
about christmas town how the artists
25:14
where um they give away their paintings
25:16
is it the same with bakeries like we can
25:18
make really huge christmas cookies and
25:20
then give them away to all our neighbors
25:23
oh yes you can they'll probably be lined
25:25
up outside
25:29
you can give away your baked goods and i
25:31
know people they say i don't know what
25:33
my gift is and yet oh my word they like
25:35
to make the best brownies on the earth
25:37
and when are you kidding it's going to
25:39
be making brownies you know they love to
25:41
do it they love to give them away as
25:42
gifts
25:44
uh people who are blessed on the earth
25:45
are the ones who who get to operate in
25:47
their gift now
25:49
and so uh they they're used to do that
25:51
but in heaven nobody misses their true
25:53
destiny
25:54
god sent us all as a gift with a gift it
25:58
wasn't not talking about a spiritual
25:59
group talk about a natural gift that
26:01
everybody can enjoy
26:03
and uh and we know people who sing
26:05
they're singing amazing that's their
26:07
gift people in sports they play really
26:08
well that's their gift but there's a lot
26:10
of other gifts gifts there's like design
26:13
you know or baking i can tell you that
26:16
that food and baking and stuff like that
26:18
is considered an art in heaven
26:23
that's awesome
26:24
i can't wait to bake and and i bet the
26:26
the machinery there is like incredible
26:29
too
26:30
like
26:31
huge mixers times 10.
26:34
yes it's incred the thing is is now
26:36
if you want to have a bakery that will
26:39
be part of your mansion you don't have a
26:41
place where you live in a place where
26:42
you work and it's not work when you love
26:45
it right
26:46
so you would go to your mansion to visit
26:48
your bakery and all your good you'd have
26:51
a showroom with all the food there you
26:53
had made and yes they do have kitchens
26:55
in heaven if you want one now if you're
26:58
gonna be a baker you're gonna have to
26:59
have a kitchen you probably have people
27:01
a sign that that's their gift is to help
27:03
in that um unless it's one of the little
27:06
tiny angels that looks sort of like an
27:08
elf and i'm just gonna get bash for that
27:10
but i don't care uh there are ones that
27:12
you have little helpers assigned in
27:14
heaven if you have a bakery because you
27:15
know you know if you got a half a
27:17
million people coming to get your goods
27:18
you need help
27:20
yes
27:21
and so it's a whole different life
27:24
because i've seen the kitchen of someone
27:26
who loved to feed people her dining room
27:29
seated 100 people and it was a dining
27:31
room in her mansion and in her kitchen
27:33
had such high tech i didn't even know
27:36
what some of the stuff was this is one
27:38
of the best parts about heaven if you
27:39
choose to cook i saw this woman making a
27:42
massive salad that was going to be
27:44
served
27:45
to all of her guests and she was peeling
27:47
like a cucumber and as she peeled it in
27:49
the in the and it came off of the
27:51
cucumber it disappeared there's no waste
27:54
there's no trash there's no cleanup how
27:57
about that isn't that awesome hallelujah
28:01
there's no cleanup no garbage to take
28:03
out people there's there's no waste
28:04
dumps and having to leave stuff
28:07
it just disappears and um
28:10
that's like back to the waterfall
28:11
chocolate waterfalls you can get in and
28:13
swim around you have chocolate all over
28:15
you but when you step out of it it's
28:16
gone
28:18
so but the food thing in heaven just
28:20
amazed me that everything you eat is
28:22
made out of life but your substance i
28:24
know people think well light is
28:26
something you can't really touch or feel
28:28
and heaven it is it's the number one
28:30
thing that things are made out of in
28:32
heaven actually your spirit man is made
28:34
out of light but you don't float around
28:36
like a little cloud in heaven you walk
28:38
on the streets you use your stuff in
28:40
your mansion you ride the horses uh it's
28:43
an actual life it's a literal life in
28:46
heaven
28:47
wow that's awesome well i'm excited to
28:50
go and cook in heaven i'm telling you
28:52
that i've had that deep within me where
28:54
i'm like i can't wait to cook and bake
28:56
and give away my stuff in heaven because
28:58
that is your visit your place yes
29:01
please do please everybody come visit me
29:04
please okay
29:05
um
29:06
elaine elaine wants to know can you
29:08
describe how jesus became a seed and was
29:12
planted in the womb of young mary
29:15
that's awesome
29:17
there's actually a story the holy spirit
29:19
told me one time
29:20
it's called twas the year before
29:22
christmas
29:24
and i'm just going to share a little
29:25
part of it i'll probably have it printed
29:27
out later on there but it starts like
29:29
twas the year before christmas when all
29:32
through father's house every creature
29:34
was stirring yes even the mouse
29:37
there was so much activity like uh maybe
29:41
um earth time a year before that when it
29:44
was being announced that the word
29:47
who was christ in heaven the word was
29:49
going to be sent to earth as a baby to
29:52
be raised up to walk among the people
29:55
here
29:56
and then one day would give himself for
29:58
them so
30:00
i don't know if people even think about
30:02
this they think well they're just
30:03
supernatural they just fly around do
30:05
whatever they want to do oh no there's
30:06
much planning in heaven and explaining
30:09
in heaven because you have to understand
30:11
the angels were there long before we
30:14
were put on the earth
30:16
and so there was all kinds of activity
30:18
in heaven all the time they'd be sent on
30:19
assignments places throughout the cosmos
30:22
and
30:23
things so much activity going on in
30:25
heaven
30:26
because people were on the earth you
30:28
know people were living on the earth at
30:29
the time christ was born and so the
30:32
father had to take the word and explain
30:34
to him this is the plan this is the plan
30:38
i have for you
30:39
you will have flesh on you number one
30:41
the word was all spirit but like i
30:43
explained in heaven that's like a whole
30:45
different realm the spiritual realm to a
30:48
spiritual person would be literal like
30:50
i'm touching this like i'm holding this
30:53
cup right here see in heaven if you had
30:55
something to drink uh you would also
30:58
touch the cup and drink out of it even
31:00
though it's a spiritual world uh it
31:03
still had life and activity and there
31:05
was building going on plans being made
31:08
talking about people who had just come
31:09
home to heaven people getting to greet
31:11
them so but heaven does like to have a
31:14
lot of celebrations so this was a
31:16
different time when the father called
31:18
the word to see him and explained to him
31:21
talked to him he said would you be
31:22
willing to do this he asked him we know
31:25
it was it was at that time it was a
31:27
father the word and holy spirit
31:31
and when the father would want to create
31:33
something when there was nothing he
31:35
would go somewhere where there was
31:36
nothing he would speak what he wanted
31:38
the word would step out of him
31:40
and you have to understand in the
31:42
spiritual world the father the father
31:44
son holy spirit can step inside of each
31:46
other that's what makes them one the
31:48
three in one
31:50
so they would go places together and i'm
31:52
thinking the word probably thought oh
31:53
we're going to go create something but
31:55
the father took him aside and explained
31:56
to him it's time now
31:59
for hope to come to the earth
32:02
and therefore my plan is to send you
32:05
as a baby to be a baby on you to be
32:08
raised by a wonderful mom
32:10
and then one day you would grow up and
32:12
then you would give yourself
32:14
for the sins of the world
32:16
and i'm quite sure because i know we
32:18
think well they know everything the
32:20
father really does know everything
32:21
because everything comes from him
32:24
and this was his plan for man to help
32:26
man to help man on the earth they needed
32:28
help okay uh the enemy who satan was
32:31
wreaking havoc everywhere he was just
32:33
getting people to fall into darkness and
32:36
the answer was to send the light of the
32:38
world which was jesus christ so he did
32:40
explain to him he said i will take you
32:43
and i will make you into a seed and holy
32:45
spirit will take you down to the earth
32:47
hover over mary and plant you in the
32:50
womb of mary
32:52
and i know people don't think about this
32:54
too much when they just read the word
32:55
but you should really study the word
32:58
it says in there that he was planted in
33:00
this as a seed in mary and later because
33:03
we know man carries a seed i won't get
33:05
into all that normally the man carries a
33:07
seed and then you get married then you
33:08
have children but this was totally
33:10
different
33:11
uh this was a supernatural divine thing
33:14
that happened that the father
33:16
took the word who was his son made him
33:18
into a seed the holy spirit hovered over
33:20
the womb of mary and even talks about it
33:22
in the bible and then she he was he was
33:24
planted as a seed grew up in mary was
33:28
burst into the earth as a real being he
33:30
had flesh on him okay
33:33
why did he have to have flesh so that
33:34
people could see him because on the
33:37
earth normally you don't see spiritual
33:39
beings unless god opens your eyes to
33:41
that spirit realm which is also all
33:43
around us so he had to explain not only
33:46
to him what he was going to do he had to
33:48
take all the tribes of angels and
33:50
explain to them this is what is going to
33:52
happen
33:53
it's going to be different now it'll be
33:55
different because redemption is coming
33:57
to mankind the word has said yes he's
34:00
willing to do this
34:01
and then he will be known on the earth
34:03
as my son who one day will give himself
34:06
they were totally they were undone
34:09
because this was something that had
34:10
never happened before
34:12
i know when new things happen on the
34:14
earth people think oh that couldn't
34:15
happen or that won't happen but you know
34:17
heaven has been through many things like
34:18
we have there was even there was kind of
34:21
war one time in heaven that was when
34:22
satan tried to take over and he was
34:24
kicked out in a lightning bolt
34:26
uh so they've experienced that all of
34:28
that happening so this was new news even
34:31
for them a new revelation so now the
34:33
word was being sent to the earth
34:35
would be not not recognized on the earth
34:38
because when he was the word he was a
34:39
spiritual body and he's going to have
34:42
flesh on him so he'll look different and
34:44
they could watch from having to see
34:45
everything going on
34:46
so yes on that beautiful morning
34:50
nine months after the holy spirit
34:51
hovered over mary and planted that seed
34:54
uh jesus christ and then he was born
34:57
into this earth such a celebration in
34:59
heaven took place um that the host came
35:02
in saying to the shepherds gabriel came
35:04
to announce his birth
35:06
i'm sure there was quite a sight uh you
35:09
know here on the earth to see this all
35:11
this activity going on it was very major
35:14
for the father to give his son as a gift
35:17
to this world
35:19
and that's why god loves it when we give
35:21
gifts just so you realize
35:23
christmas time on the earth is so
35:25
precious to god it represents us loving
35:27
one another giving gifts to each other
35:30
helping each other you know making a
35:31
difference bringing hope when christ
35:33
came
35:34
as that child he began to bring hope to
35:36
people
35:37
everything was going to change about
35:40
when you pass from this earth you could
35:42
go back home to heaven having received
35:45
christ as your savior so this is one of
35:46
the best gifts ever given to the earth
35:49
would be
35:50
jesus christ the son of the living god
35:52
and he was raised just like you and i
35:55
had to be a little baby learn to walk
35:57
and learn to read and write and i do
36:00
know this about jesus he loved reading
36:03
when he was being schooled on the earth
36:04
he didn't care too much about writing
36:07
and i love the holy spirit he said
36:08
that's why there's only 10 commandments
36:10
instead of 20 because he didn't care too
36:12
much about writing that's a joke in case
36:14
you didn't get it
36:16
so anyway the star coming several years
36:19
before the birth of christ that the wise
36:21
men came across the deserts
36:23
and some people see them in a little
36:25
play here's the three kings they were
36:27
from different countries they saw the
36:30
star of christ in the east so they
36:32
traveled east from the desert regions
36:34
from three different countries it took
36:36
them two years to cross those deserts to
36:39
come and bring the gifts to
36:41
to to jesus and i don't know that he was
36:43
living in the manger at that time they
36:45
did come to honor him recognize who he
36:47
was so even people on in other countries
36:50
knew something special had happened
36:53
and so from that point on jesus lived
36:56
his life walked out his life on this
36:57
earth so that he could become our
37:00
sacrifice and what he was doing was
37:02
making a way back to the father so i
37:05
will say this the day you pass and you
37:08
step out of this body and you're going
37:10
home to heaven jesus will come get you
37:12
he's the one who walks you up the steps
37:14
of the throne and says look father your
37:17
if your son or daughter your son or your
37:19
daughter whichever one is has come home
37:21
to you
37:22
that's part of the blessing that christ
37:25
gets for having given himself for so but
37:28
it was all a stir in heaven all these
37:30
people these these creatures and these
37:33
angels and the host of heaven the army
37:35
they were all talking back and forth
37:36
non-stop did you hear the words going to
37:38
go to earth did you hear he's going to
37:40
be a baby uh that sounds to them that
37:42
was like sort of wild but they knew when
37:44
the father said something it was going
37:46
to happen
37:47
so all of heaven prepared for this to
37:49
happen things were repaired on the earth
37:51
people were put in place there would be
37:54
a part of this whole story of his birth
37:56
how they had to travel they were told
37:58
they had to travel to uh you know be
38:00
accountable for who they were and
38:01
register
38:03
and that happened to be in bethlehem how
38:05
about that and god had already placed
38:07
his star in the heavens to be seen
38:10
uh two years before this happened so
38:12
that's the true story of why we
38:15
celebrate this time of the year is
38:17
because we celebrate the birth of jesus
38:20
christ who came for us because he loved
38:22
us the father loved us
38:25
the holy spirit loved us and this is
38:27
their plan
38:28
for you for i for every person in the
38:30
earth god desires that none should
38:32
perish but you have to choose jesus
38:34
christ to live in this beautiful place
38:36
this world called heaven that is the
38:39
father's house
38:42
that's beautiful when you talk about
38:45
jesus walking us up the stairs back to
38:47
the father
38:50
i mean that
38:51
touches my heart so deeply because it's
38:54
i can just imagine that and the beauty
38:57
of
38:58
seeing the father and just the love that
39:01
must come and
39:03
washed over you as you're with
39:05
jesus and seeing the thought oh i just
39:08
can't wait for that day
39:09
oh you're already undone
39:12
that
39:13
that jesus christ
39:14
is with you
39:16
you hear about him people have
39:18
encounters sometimes i already got the
39:19
spirit of god all over me right now
39:21
you hear stories of people encountering
39:23
him on the earth and i can say i have
39:26
seen him many times but it is never
39:29
normal i'm so undone every time consumed
39:32
by the love that just comes from him it
39:35
it just permeates every part of your
39:37
body and you forget about every care you
39:39
have you're not you're not listening so
39:41
much to all the stuff going on right now
39:43
in this world god has a plan for this
39:45
world okay it says the earth is the
39:48
lord's and the fullness thereof this
39:50
earth belongs to jesus christ he paid a
39:52
price for it and he knows what's going
39:54
on let me tell you there's stuff that's
39:56
going to be exposed i can just say get
39:58
ready for some great great days ahead no
40:00
matter what the enemy thinks they're
40:02
going to do god has a plan to be in some
40:04
of the greatest days if you're young you
40:06
have the most powerful amazing future
40:09
ever on the earth to do great things for
40:11
him the creativity will be so powerful
40:14
and amazing people will be shocked some
40:16
of the stuff will be created on the
40:17
earth to help us our life to be better
40:20
and and happier but the number one thing
40:22
that will happen is the presence of the
40:25
lord is about to consume this whole
40:27
earth and the knowledge of that glory
40:30
will be seen and known all over the
40:31
earth
40:33
hallelujah i feel i feel that so strong
40:36
when you talk about that it's it's going
40:38
to be an awesome time it's awesome time
40:41
to be alive
40:42
uh there was some there's someone who
40:44
asked a question about i wanted to find
40:47
it real quick because they asked about
40:48
the oh the shepherds here we go sally
40:51
asked about um what happened to the
40:54
shepherds to whom the angels appeared
40:57
30 years later did they connect with
41:00
jesus um the baby they had seen or did
41:03
they always wonder what happened to that
41:06
baby have you seen any of those
41:08
shepherds in heaven
41:10
um i'm sure the shepherds made it happen
41:13
i will tell you this they never forgot
41:16
what they saw
41:17
i mean here is one of the one one of the
41:19
archangels appearing and gabriel is
41:21
beautiful he's so glorious i'm sure the
41:24
sky lit up you know the sky open person
41:28
lit up and here he's given this glorious
41:30
announcement you know that this messiah
41:33
is being born the son of god has come to
41:35
be amongst mankind and i can tell you
41:38
that i will say this too that where it
41:40
talks about the great host appeared the
41:42
ones that sang were actually part of the
41:44
army of heaven okay
41:47
and you know it says in the bible that
41:48
the shepherds were afraid they were so
41:50
afraid that their body hurt now they
41:52
weren't going to be hurt but they'd
41:53
never seen anything like this so you can
41:55
imagine warring angels coming with
41:58
gabriel to sing and to glorify christ's
42:00
birth on the earth that's actually what
42:03
actually happened and so they were
42:05
singing i'm sure it was really loud but
42:07
it was beautiful and so you think you
42:10
saw just one angel you'd never forget it
42:12
but here you've seen multitudes of the
42:15
these armies of heaven and gabriel
42:17
and the seraphim probably were there
42:19
singing their heads are like blue fire
42:22
blue fire their hair is so can you
42:24
imagine this site and i know no one has
42:26
been there and has not seen it doesn't
42:28
understand i was taken back and i
42:30
actually saw that scene i saw what
42:32
happened because he was using the army
42:34
of heaven and i'm like no wonder no
42:37
wonder no for me because i see i'm a
42:39
seer i see the army of heaven around me
42:40
all the time i see their activities i
42:42
see them you know battling the army of
42:44
darkness and how badly they get beat
42:47
the army of darkness gets beat but so
42:50
i'm i was accustomed to seeing them but
42:51
seeing the sight
42:53
the shepherds were cowering behind rocks
42:56
or bushes their eyes were so wide you
42:58
know here's gabriel making this
43:00
beautiful announcement and then here
43:01
comes the army to sing in the heavens
43:04
and and it's the lights just like
43:05
blinding from there so you can imagine
43:08
they probably repeated that story over
43:10
and over again to everybody they knew
43:12
probably they probably didn't believe it
43:13
but it didn't matter to them when you
43:15
have an encounter you never forget it so
43:17
i'm quite sure because jesus did teach
43:20
over in that region he taught over there
43:22
there was jerusalem and other places
43:24
there
43:25
i'm sure some of the shepherds probably
43:27
eventually lived in um
43:29
in jerusalem i mean it wasn't that many
43:31
years now he was in there he was already
43:34
known as a great carpenter joseph taught
43:36
him as a master carpenter so jesus was
43:39
known as the carpenter the son of joseph
43:42
but we know he was the son of god
43:44
uh so he was known because of that
43:46
but but when jesus turned
43:49
30 he began his public ministry that
43:51
means he started demonstrating the
43:52
miracles the signs and wonders and i'm
43:55
quite sure it made it back to the ears
43:57
of those because this spread far and
43:59
wide that said i'm sure that some of
44:01
those who were in bethlehem or maybe
44:03
relooking in jerusalem they probably
44:05
knew exactly who that was when he
44:07
started talking about being the son of
44:08
god i i'm quite sure that there are some
44:11
of those shepherds are in heaven yes
44:15
wow that's awesome i i can imagine that
44:18
you went got actually got to go back and
44:20
see that whole entire scene
44:24
that's incredible oh my god i can so if
44:28
when i get to go to heaven can i go to a
44:30
place to watch that scene too
44:33
yes actually there is a place they have
44:35
um they actually have theaters in heaven
44:37
how about that now again i have to
44:39
always explain you don't have to have
44:42
ratings like r for rotten pg like partly
44:45
good g for good
44:47
uh you know i mean they actually they
44:49
they know what goes on here so any of
44:52
the theaters in heaven again there's no
44:54
darkness there's not going to be
44:55
profanity there's no no uh you know
44:58
killings none of that no violence
45:00
whatsoever so there's no dark witchcraft
45:02
none of that is in the theaters in
45:04
heaven but they have a place where you
45:05
can go
45:06
uh and you can actually watch when god
45:09
made when they made the earth you
45:11
actually get to see him creating earth
45:13
by watching it but it's not like a
45:15
screen it's like you're there
45:20
wow
45:21
oh my gosh i can't i cannot wait for
45:24
that um there's another question about
45:27
um renee asked this question and i've
45:29
heard a few people ask this question
45:31
before
45:32
um i'm seeing a lot of christians
45:34
fighting about celebrating or not
45:36
christmas is that a spirit of religion
45:39
trying to stop the celebration of
45:41
christ's birth
45:43
i think it's partly that i think it's
45:45
partly what we've been taught our whole
45:47
lives in church
45:50
you know depending on the church you go
45:51
to because you know there can be 50
45:53
churches to probably hundreds of
45:54
thousands of churches right now
45:56
and i tell you i tell people no matter
45:58
what church you go to make sure they're
46:00
teaching about the validity of jesus
46:02
christ who he is he's the only way to
46:04
heaven
46:04
i think it was that but i think totally
46:06
satan any chance satan god to draw
46:09
people away from the truth
46:12
that's the bottom line satan doesn't
46:14
want people to have fun
46:15
joy celebration but he does not want
46:18
them to have the truth because the truth
46:21
sets you free
46:23
so okay this place in heaven was created
46:26
before the earth was here
46:29
so you can't say
46:31
that christmas is some pagan holiday
46:33
sorry people
46:35
okay the pagans weren't here when god
46:38
made it in heaven however there is
46:40
someone who lived in heaven saw all the
46:42
beauty the wonder and the fun and when
46:44
he was thrown out of heaven he created
46:47
wicked evil things and said that was his
46:50
symbol that was his celebration their
46:52
lies i'm not saying there weren't these
46:55
wicked groups on the earth doing things
46:57
but satan stole different things in
46:59
heaven to make them look like they were
47:01
bad
47:02
so christmas town belongs to god
47:05
he decided to create it no human hands
47:08
made that place because it's a place of
47:10
fun of splendor a place to celebrate his
47:13
son it's in heaven he loves it when we
47:17
celebrate it on the earth and you know
47:20
what you all need to go get can you get
47:22
me the dvd real quick jen i'm going to
47:24
show you really quick a dvd i would
47:26
encourage everyone to get and watch with
47:28
your family it's called saving christmas
47:31
it's right there by kirk cameron
47:33
actually got really tired of listening
47:35
to the very thing you're talking about
47:37
he got tired of all the insults and and
47:40
and dragging you know christmas down
47:42
saying it's a pagan you shouldn't have
47:43
nothing to do with it so he went to the
47:46
word of god got all the scriptures and
47:49
wrote this script for this movie called
47:51
saving christmas it is hilarious but it
47:54
actually shows you nicholas back in the
47:56
time when he walked down the earth where
47:58
that came from and he actually explains
48:01
why christmas is so important on the
48:04
earth
48:04
like i said it's the only time some
48:06
people forgive each other it's the one
48:09
time they reach out and give to help
48:11
others even people they don't know
48:13
and we watch this many times and so i'm
48:15
just going to show you the cover i
48:17
already heard from kirk cameron's people
48:18
saying thank you for showing it
48:20
it explains everything and i think you
48:22
can get it on amazon is that where you
48:24
got it janet amazon so i'm going to
48:26
share with you right now here it is
48:28
it's called saving christmas
48:30
by kirk cameron and he explains why the
48:33
christmas tree is important are the all
48:36
the balls the lights on the tree what
48:38
they represent and you know representing
48:40
christ
48:41
even things like the nutcracker what
48:43
that represents for for heaven for
48:45
heaven on the earth and why do we eat
48:48
why do we celebrate what does all this
48:50
mean
48:51
and he shoots down
48:53
every myth
48:55
or reality of what evil has tried to
48:58
take over he explains it the best of
49:00
anyone i've ever heard so i will
49:02
encourage people get that dvd
49:05
let let yourself watch it with you and
49:07
your in your family it's the best
49:09
explanation i've heard i can just say
49:12
christmas even now people are having
49:14
more hope than they've had in like
49:16
almost two years uh hope is flooding
49:19
joyous flooding through celebration
49:22
i know most people pitch or sell heaven
49:24
is nothing but a place where you bow
49:26
down to god all the time part of the way
49:28
we worship in heaven is enjoying things
49:31
he put there that's our gratefulness for
49:33
what he gave us even in heaven so heaven
49:36
celebrates
49:38
it doesn't have funerals
49:40
there's no funerals there's no firing
49:42
squads there's no death certificates
49:44
being made out no one's crying no one's
49:47
grieving in heaven it is a celebration
49:50
of what christ did for us
49:53
by coming to this earth walking as a man
49:57
showing you the right way to live what
49:59
righteousness is what unrighteousness is
50:01
but i can tell you what there is a
50:03
copycat enemy our true enemy enemy is
50:06
satan i know he uses wicked people to do
50:09
things and then he makes up all these
50:12
occults and all these things i don't
50:14
even understand don't care about because
50:16
i'm not a part of that and i choose not
50:18
to participate or read it or watch it i
50:21
feel myself with the light of god with
50:23
his word what his plans are but i can
50:25
tell you christmas
50:27
has always had the presence of god on it
50:30
when you attend church celebrating the
50:32
birth of christ the choir singing
50:34
represents the angels that sang on the
50:37
day of his birth of some of the most
50:38
glorious songs ever made or created were
50:41
ones about christmas because in those
50:43
songs many of them talk about oh holy
50:45
night
50:46
hearts and heart the herald angels sing
50:49
and so all these beautiful things came
50:51
out of this one beautiful holiday
50:54
it's more than a holiday it's actually a
50:57
way of life that's what it is so yes i
51:00
celebrate it i will celebrate it now i
51:03
will celebrate in heaven one day it
51:05
brings families together but the gift
51:08
giving is one of the big things i know
51:10
man has commercialized it and i'm not
51:12
saying you know go go get a gift for
51:13
somebody it's a wonderful beautiful
51:14
thing to do maybe help the poor with
51:17
something
51:18
you know that's one of my favorite
51:19
things to do also but christmas is dear
51:22
to the father's heart
51:23
he made it
51:25
not a pagan
51:26
not some satanic group
51:28
even satan didn't make it he just tried
51:31
to steal it
51:32
and he lost
51:35
amen
51:36
and what this is a perfect this is a
51:38
perfect question to go along with what
51:40
you just said um there's the user it
51:43
says username because i'm happy they
51:46
asked a question um what can we give
51:48
jesus for his birthday to show him we
51:52
love and honor him i'm gonna move my
51:54
scarf over there yo
51:55
i would say
51:58
he loves cards
52:01
and uh what i do if i want to make a
52:03
card out for jesus i actually make one
52:05
out to him and i put it on my tree
52:07
i mean you don't need to put it even in
52:09
a card you can make him one
52:11
i would say he loves the kids to draw
52:13
pictures you know maybe christmas trees
52:15
or gifts or something like that
52:18
just telling him that you love him thank
52:21
him for coming to earth to be the way to
52:23
make a way back to the father
52:25
he loves it when we sing christmas
52:28
carols especially ones that talk about
52:30
the holy night and away in the manger
52:32
he loves and actually watches many of
52:36
the events put on by churches or groups
52:39
that show that scene back in the way
52:41
back in the day when christ was born and
52:43
they have someone be mary and joseph and
52:45
baby jesus and then they show you know
52:47
if they're really big ones they bring
52:49
live animals in
52:50
but he lost to see the celebration in
52:52
our heart so i would say the best gift
52:55
you could give him would be celebrate
52:57
the holiday
52:58
help people love them and remember why
53:02
we celebrate it
53:03
it is about funny gifts and you know the
53:06
joy but number one it's about a child
53:10
being born in the manger a king the king
53:12
of this world who created everything we
53:15
see and everything we touch and he's
53:17
very much a lie right now excited about
53:21
this time of the year
53:23
so i'd say make a little note telling
53:25
him that drawing a little picture
53:27
hang it on your tree
53:29
if i was a parent i would save those
53:30
somewhere in a special box one day and
53:32
say this is what you did
53:34
to celebrate our king jesus
53:37
oh that's beautiful
53:39
uh there brandon wants to know is there
53:42
spiritual significance when people here
53:45
on earth light up their homes with
53:47
christmas lights do people in heaven
53:49
light up their mansion in a similar
53:51
fashion for the sake of christmas
53:55
they have lights everywhere i can tell
53:57
you if you think that you've been driven
53:59
somewhere where they have a lot of
54:00
decorations and things
54:02
everywhere in christmas town even
54:04
outside of christmas town they all have
54:06
some kind of lights because it's
54:08
celebrating when the angels came and the
54:12
sky lit up with the glory of heaven
54:15
that's actually what those lights
54:16
represent that's what they like they
54:18
represent on your tree on your home
54:20
you're making a statement i celebrate
54:22
the birth of jesus christ i celebrate
54:25
with him in my life that i belong to him
54:29
and i'm recognizing that i'm standing
54:31
with the promises he gave me so i would
54:34
say definitely put lights up
54:36
we put lights everywhere we can
54:38
uh the other thing one more thing in the
54:40
and jesus just said to me now that
54:43
sounds wild he said don't forget the
54:46
cake
54:47
it is celebrating my birthday why not
54:50
make a cake and eat it so i can come and
54:53
see you eating the cake we actually make
54:56
a birthday cake for jesus on christmas
54:58
and at our christmas dinner we have a
55:00
birthday cake for jesus and we sing
55:02
happy birthday to him even though he
55:04
doesn't need to have that done he loves
55:06
it so don't forget to have cake or
55:09
cupcakes or something
55:10
that your children can be a part of and
55:13
celebrate with him
55:15
at a time when he had to change his
55:17
whole life
55:18
and even who he was just to come to this
55:21
earth for us
55:23
so we can sing happy birthday to jesus
55:27
on christmas and
55:28
make that part of our family tradition
55:30
with our kids so that they're always
55:33
raised knowing that it is that's why we
55:35
celebrate that's a great idea to do that
55:38
as a family for all you moms with young
55:40
kids that's a great idea we did that
55:43
growing up and now we still do it even
55:45
now we still do it so definitely you're
55:47
recognizing him you're you're honoring
55:49
him by recognizing him that he is so
55:52
special he's worth making a cake for
55:54
besides like i said he loves sweets i
55:57
didn't get to finish that when jesus was
55:59
growing up as a child he loved honeycomb
56:01
it was his favorite thing it talked
56:03
about it in the bible him and honey but
56:06
john the baptist his cousin also ate
56:08
honey and it was the sweet of that time
56:11
that would be like eating cake you know
56:13
in this day and he still loves sweets
56:16
and every time some new baker comes home
56:18
to heaven he's going to visit their shop
56:20
uh he loves his squeezing
56:23
he'll probably visit you if you make
56:24
sweet sweet
56:27
i was just making a half cake have cake
56:30
and celebrate the birth of christ
56:32
oh that's awesome well we have one i
56:35
think we can get through one more
56:36
question um christine asked my dad went
56:39
to be with god recently and he loved to
56:42
feed god's cardinals
56:45
my dad loved how the snow and the
56:47
cardinals looked would my dad be feeding
56:50
the birds in christmas town or are they
56:52
all over heaven
56:55
birds are all over heaven but i have
56:57
seen i don't know why they just look so
56:59
beautiful people make ornaments with the
57:01
red cardinals and i think i know they're
57:03
around normally other times of the year
57:05
but i just think they're represented if
57:07
you look at i got probably probably 20
57:10
christmas cards at least that had red
57:11
cardinals on them i'm not kidding
57:13
like with the tree with the snow and
57:15
everything in it i'm sure there are
57:18
birds there because the birds come to
57:19
sing happy birthday to jesus too
57:22
and so the birds will come in they'll go
57:24
out they'll come in but i have seen red
57:26
cardinals in heaven uh in christmas town
57:29
and other types of birds too but i'm
57:32
sure that they will be able to see birds
57:34
in that place singing
57:36
to jesus
57:37
oh that's beautiful well thank cat for
57:40
all the
57:41
questions today i mean they were they
57:43
were some awesome questions when i was
57:45
reading through them i was like oh my
57:46
gosh these are all you guys did an
57:48
awesome job sending in christmas time
57:50
questions i enjoyed each and every one
57:53
of them so will you just pray for us
57:56
real quick before we end uh this time
57:58
together and just bless everybody that's
58:00
listening
58:02
sure um i was gonna show one more
58:04
picture
58:05
and this represents sort of like the
58:07
army of heaven coming with gabriel
58:09
making the announcement um this is the
58:11
star right here if you can see if i can
58:14
hold it right i'll put the star you see
58:16
the star or not
58:17
yes
58:19
is it right side up
58:20
yeah there's the star of bethlehem
58:23
there's gabriel making the announcement
58:25
but the army that's with him is not
58:28
normal
58:29
and you can see some of them look like
58:31
creatures and they're singing so the
58:32
shepherds would be down on the ground
58:34
you know trying to go like oh my gosh
58:36
what is that and what is that up there
58:38
in the sky uh whenever it says host uh
58:41
in the bible they're talking about the
58:42
army of heaven
58:43
and so uh yes many of them came to sing
58:46
because you have to remember
58:48
jesus name was the lord of hosts so this
58:51
was his army coming to sing about his
58:54
birth on the earth along with gabriel
58:57
and so i had to show that real quick
58:58
picture but i will pray father i thank
59:01
you right now for blessing everybody in
59:03
this wonderful time this wonderful
59:05
season on the earth god don't let
59:08
legalism and religious mindsets set into
59:11
people that they don't think you should
59:12
celebrate it's not about fun
59:15
it totally has always been about fun the
59:18
sacrifice of your son
59:20
was one part of his life but his birth
59:23
was totally different
59:25
great celebrations were taking place in
59:27
heaven even mary and joseph and those
59:30
who were present with him they were
59:31
celebrating
59:32
and knowing he was the son of god coming
59:34
to this to this earth so father i thank
59:36
you that the reality and the presence of
59:38
jesus christ will flood everyone's home
59:41
everyone's person at this time of the
59:43
year god let love
59:45

59:49
cares you know jesus came to take them
59:52
away
59:53
i thank you for recognizing his birth
59:55
recognizing who he is but also remember
59:58
the celebration part
60:00
that they celebrate in heaven on earth
60:03

60:05

60:14
we're entering into a holy season of the
60:17
glory being released in the earth thank

01:49
in the rear view mirror you know not
01:51
that god was taken
01:52
by surprise by any of this he saw it all
01:55
ahead of time he knew what was going to
01:57
happen he wasn't shocked or starved in
01:59
fact i'm going to ask cat a question
02:00
about that when we bring her on in just
02:02
a minute but a couple of quick
02:04
announcements
02:05
for the next 90 days give or take uh
02:09
when we do johnny eno and he'll be on

04:26
in kat kerr
04:28
hi there
04:29
kat how are you doing
04:31
i'm doing great
04:32
good so you just said you're taking a
04:34
little bit of vacation so you're back
04:36
from your vacation started to do the
04:38
show and then back at it
04:40
well my vacation is i get a hotel in the
04:43
city because i have to come back and
04:45
forth here all the time so it's not like
04:47
i'm a way away that's but still you know
04:51
i'm away at the nighttime
04:53
wow nice nice family visiting and of
04:56
course right now we're not out of our
04:58
our offices yet so there's really no
05:01
place for anyone to visit me here so
05:03
just go get a really big nice hotel room
05:05
and get them some and we all can get
05:07
together and do things that's what we do
05:09
good good
05:10
i have a question that i will open with
05:12
when we go to questions
05:14
but before i do that um anything you
05:16
want to talk about current events or
05:18
anything going into next year anything
05:19
that either the lord's showing you or
05:21
what to expect i'm going to throw that
05:23
to you because we haven't pre-talked
05:24
about this i don't know if you have
05:25
anything so
05:26
oh i do absolutely the father's been
05:29
talking to me the last few days
05:31
now you have to understand when he talks
05:33
to me he talks to me like it's already
05:35
done when i say already done i mean his
05:37
plan
05:38
at the completion of his plan for
05:40
america his completion of his plan in
05:43
these days
05:44
for the world so he talks to me it's
05:46
always positive it's always powerful and
05:48
that's why i'm able to release that to
05:50
the people but i want you to know
05:53
even though it looks pretty bad in
05:54
certain places there are things still
05:56
happening i mean i i think probably the
05:59
number one thing i notice and hear about
06:01
a lot is how many people in the country
06:03
this country america are standing up
06:05
against the left i'm not going to say
06:07
much more than that
06:09
in unexpected ways and they they didn't
06:12
ever think this would all happen
06:14
i know you think it's all dragged up
06:16
they thought everything was going to be
06:17
over a couple months like they'd have us
06:19
and our whole lives would be over that's
06:21
what they had planned but the devil
06:24
always forgets
06:26
that we have god in us and this is god's
06:28
country and he doesn't know the mind of
06:31
god himself satan does not he doesn't
06:34
even know your mind unless you speak it
06:36
that's why you need to be careful what
06:37
you're saying with your mouth that's
06:39
good a lot in the atmosphere around you
06:41
you actually create an atmosphere around
06:43
you who's going to be in that atmosphere
06:45
and so make sure it's not all about doom
06:47
and gloom and fear and stuff like that
06:49
i'm not saying that kind of thing thing
06:51
isn't real but you do not have to choose
06:53
that so i can tell you god does not
06:55
choose it he's talking about the days of
06:58
glory more than he ever has before to me
07:01
because he said everything is beginning
07:03
to be like dust
07:05
and i know you probably don't understand
07:06
that as a spiritual a phrase that means
07:09
everything you're living in now or
07:11
having to be confronted with now will
07:13
become like
07:14
dust and in spiritual that means that
07:18
will be hard to see
07:19
hard to remember what that was like so
07:22
when things do happen on god's timeline
07:25
because everybody's talking about
07:27
different timelines or calendars or
07:29
whatever i go by god's timeline and if
07:32
you could be taken to heaven i'd
07:33
probably ask him to show you his own
07:35
timeline that wouldn't take you forever
07:38
because then you would know number one
07:40
you're not at certain times that people
07:42
are saying right this is not the
07:44
perilous times it is not the tribulation
07:47
and stop saying that the antichrist is
07:50
on the earth he's not on the earth
07:52
people the antichrist spirit is which is
07:55
a whole different thing but he's not
07:57
here yet okay he's not going to sit
07:59
around and wait for several hundred
08:00
years to do anything
08:02
satan however is trying to do a big
08:04
takeover right now which will fail
08:06
miserably
08:08
embarrassingly
08:10
i'm telling you what they won't want to
08:12
talk about hell and these times are
08:14
going through because of what is about
08:15
to happen they won't talk about that
08:17
part he probably won't allow them to
08:19
mention what a huge fail it was and
08:22
trying to take over this country and i
08:24
don't even have to mention names or
08:25
right or left or anything to tell you
08:27
that i'm telling you from god's plans
08:30
the days that are coming of greater
08:32
glory major changes will begin to happen
08:36
probably in the first quarter i can tell
08:38
you that much and the first quarter of
08:41
2022 uh which is some of god's great
08:44
plans to be revealed in that time and
08:46
things major things to begin to happen
08:49
and whether it's about certain
08:51
presidents or not certain presidents
08:52
fake or real or whatever god himself is
08:55
going to start doing things in the first
08:58
quarter of this 2022 i'm extremely
09:02
excited about it so i want to encourage
09:04
you you don't have to live in your soul
09:07
but every wicked terrible thing you're
09:09
hearing or watching hopefully you're not
09:11
i do want to add one thing or this is
09:13
glorious news
09:14
i happen to know actually literally
09:18
that these big networks are way down in
09:21
their viewing by 25 or 30 percent wow
09:26
yeah that is good
09:28
they're even this is on the secular
09:30
channel this was talking about this
09:32
which i i just heard about you know
09:34
literally heard about from another news
09:36
person
09:37
that they're down like i i can't mention
09:40
what networks but you know all those
09:41
who've been going along filling people
09:43
with lies
09:44
they're down by the viewing many of them
09:47
30 percent 25 which is unheard of for
09:51
major
09:52
networks
09:53
because they won't stop saying the same
09:56
thing
09:57
people are tired of hearing the same
09:58
news hey you network you're supposed to
10:00
be able to deliver the news
10:02
unbiased to give us great information
10:05
about many different things
10:07
get out of your box get out of your rut
10:09
you're stuck in a hole you may be
10:11
covered up with dirt one day
10:14
that's good this is the for real this is
10:16
a for real does not is some kind of a
10:18
spiritual kind of a thing out there
10:20
in the natural world this is really
10:22
happening for the first time on network
10:25
reviewing they they're so they're
10:27
they're filled with fear and they're
10:28
really very upset
10:30
that people aren't watching them anymore
10:32
but they're fed up with what they're
10:33
getting that should be a clue yeah for
10:36
sure for sure okay let me ask you this
10:38
because you said something and i want to
10:40
see if i heard you right you said when
10:42
things began to happen which i think you
10:43
were referring to when god starts doing
10:45
what he's about to do
10:47
you said it would be hard to remember
10:48
were you saying it's going to be hard to
10:50
remember these bad times is that what
10:52
you were saying yes that's a huge thing
10:54
that's a huge prophetic word right there
10:57
it is it will be very hard to remember
10:59
and even in the past when people went
11:01
through things and i've said this before
11:03
but i don't mind repeating myself
11:05
because god doesn't mind repeating
11:07
himself to me
11:08
he says things almost certain parts of
11:11
the day now he's continually saying
11:13
things to me
11:14
not just to keep me encouraged but every
11:16
time he speaks his frequency goes in me
11:20
and you want people want to know why are
11:21
you so fear sometimes why do you why do
11:23
you just get loud and yell because he's
11:26
yelling
11:28
because he is so he knows that he knows
11:31
that he knows if anyone else does he
11:32
does
11:33
this is what's going to happen not what
11:35
they're saying is going to happen the
11:38
new norm will be living in the glory
11:40
manifesting for god who he is in this
11:43
earth to the point where people want
11:45
believers to be their friends
11:47
wow
11:48
wow is that going to begin to go on
11:51
you will not even in your soul have room
11:54
for the past stuff that you went through
11:57
are these days which everyone's going to
11:59
realize at one point
12:01
it was all a fake
12:03
even some of those who were part of it
12:07
god removes things sometimes off the
12:10
earth in the atmosphere
12:12
even in the spirit realm some things are
12:14
just wiped out and i can prove it in the
12:16
word of god because at the very end of
12:17
the bible it says the former things will
12:20
be remembered no more there you
12:22
go well he's the only one who can do
12:24
that and i'm telling you what he's going
12:26
to do that somewhat as this whole thing
12:29
crumbles and falls
12:31
and you need to go back and look at the
12:33
november 4th report people of um was
12:36
that 20 20 20 21
12:39
no 2020 if it's november 4th it's 2020.
12:42
yeah yeah
12:43
yeah yeah go back and see that and you
12:45
hear exactly what's gonna happen guess
12:47
what he has not changed his plans
12:50
just like when he told noah build the
12:52
ark it was 120 years later people now
12:55
aren't you glad you're not noah we're
12:57
not waiting 120 years for things to not
12:59
just go back the way they were they
13:00
there's no way they can
13:02
and we don't want them to want to be
13:04
greater and more powerful
13:06
and more known in god's presence more on
13:09
the earth and creativity and inventions
13:12
and joy and celebration we've been more
13:14
on the earth than they ever before so
13:16
you can't even say i want to go back
13:19
we're going forward
13:21
we're going forward into the news that
13:23
he has for us uh new for america new for
13:26
places in this world but i can tell you
13:28
right now he's not concerned he's not
13:30
there you know
13:31
rubbing his hands or anything yeah
13:34
he knows what our beginning is he knows
13:37
what our end is and it's not the end of
13:40
ends okay
13:41
that's good that's good cat let me ask
13:44
this question you brought this up before
13:46
a couple times we've mentioned this on
13:47
the air but it's a long time in between
13:50
where someone was writing to me the
13:51
other day and she said it was so hard
13:54
because all of these things kept
13:55
happening bad and i can identify with
13:57
that because after a year and a half of
14:00
doing this give or take um a little more
14:03
than less give or take but
14:06
you see even when i try to never watch
14:08
the news some gets in it'll slip in or
14:10
i'll see something on that net while i'm
14:12
working or something like that but
14:15
the to the to the untrained eye it looks
14:18
like worse and worse and worse things
14:20
are happening
14:22
but you said once this wickedness has
14:25
been here all along god is just
14:27
uncovering that am i saying that right
14:30
you're absolutely right and almost any
14:34
time god's going to do something really
14:36
great on the earth
14:37
the first thing he does is expose what
14:39
evil is there
14:41
you can go back to the bible with the
14:43
old testament new testament that's
14:44
happened over and over again but people
14:46
who don't study the word like study i
14:49
know people read it but if you study the
14:51
word of god you would see and you look
14:54
for certain things
14:55
in the word then you would find out that
14:57
whenever something god is going to
15:00
happen the devil shows up to make people
15:03
believe it's a lie there's no way this
15:04
can happen i'm taking over you know you
15:07
won't have a chance you won't have a
15:08
life he's done that and not just in this
15:10
country the devil always does that and
15:12
that's what he's doing now only now you
15:14
know his little ploy was take the whole
15:16
world right now i'm going to push this
15:18
whole thing through i'm going to bring
15:20
the heat like satan could do it i'm
15:22
going to bring the perilous times and
15:23
the tribulation me and that's my big
15:25
time i have news for him the tribulation
15:27
won't be his big show it's going to be
15:29
the greatest downfall he'll ever have
15:31
ever for a thousand years after that
15:33
he'll be thrown in the bottomless pit i
15:35
would say that night would be a big show
15:36
for him
15:38
so even that's not if god's already got
15:40
that
15:41
and he knows what's going to happen at
15:43
the end of those few short years he does
15:45
have which is several hundred years away
15:47
i'm just going to keep saying it
15:49
um nobody knows the day but god god
15:51
hasn't told me today but he has told me
15:52
his generations and generations away
15:56
that's good you're sitting there in fear
15:58
that your children will have already
16:00
having a rough time but your
16:01
grandchildren your great grandchildren
16:03
what is it going to be about so bad then
16:04
they won't be able to live no this is
16:06
the opposite it'd be so great the
16:08
darkness won't be able to survive very
16:10
well or work very well because of the
16:12
power of god being operated in the earth
16:15
so yes um what was the question
16:18
well you did good on that uh let me ask
16:20
you this there was a time i don't
16:22
remember i have a suspicion that it
16:24
could be this time period but when god
16:27
first told you to declare let the show
16:29
begin
16:30
and then it's like the glacier on earth
16:32
i don't know if he used that term but
16:33
when did when did he declare that to you
16:35
and what was going on in the earth at
16:37
that time that was when
16:39
um the show began was right about the
16:42
time when well i'll have to say the t
16:44
word when those elections started the
16:47
first time okay
16:49
the first time it was probably when i
16:51
can go back and look because i actually
16:53
have someone that recorded
16:55
and it might be fun actually to release
16:57
those cds just so people can happen to
17:00
hear what god was saying because it
17:01
really didn't start stuff back then yeah
17:03
i didn't know
17:04
any of this was known god already knew
17:06
this stuff would happen but he knows how
17:09
it's going to end and what will happen
17:11
why is god allowing this so he can wipe
17:13
out the platform of evil that is right
17:16
now trying to control us
17:18
you can see people go well if this
17:20
wasn't here we'd all be doing fine oh no
17:23
don't use the word fine say powerful
17:26
because if evil wasn't present to
17:28
control your every word every movement
17:30
and dictate to you as a dictator what
17:32
you were going to do what you could have
17:33
what you couldn't have
17:35
you don't you you forgot sometimes i
17:37
think what freedom really is
17:39
but what's coming is the greatest
17:41
freedom we've ever had in this country
17:44
wow that's like everywhere and he did
17:47
say that i remember even the places i
17:49
was in uh if you go back and look at um
17:52
i think it's called
17:53
what's it called jen not activation
17:55
ministries anymore if you go back and
17:57
look at yourself
17:58
gateway i'm not zion and this was back
18:00
in 2014 i think probably 2014 2015
18:05
um was when he began to say let the show
18:08
begin
18:10
and also i was in uh also in missouri
18:12
saying that some people didn't want me
18:14
to say that they weren't sure you know
18:16
who would win in 2016.
18:18
and yet he did win in a landslide yeah
18:21
before that when god said let the show
18:23
begin
18:24
that show began actually in
18:28
2016 when those elections happened that
18:31
was the show beginning wow all that
18:34
you're in guess what
18:36
all of this going on right now i got to
18:38
just move the spirit
18:40
the holy spirit's going like this
18:43
drama king people yeah
18:45
drama he's ahead of this whole drama it
18:47
is a drama and you're all a part of it
18:50
so you know what you sit in the
18:51
sidelines and you cheer him on you cheer
18:54
on god the show has begun the show of
18:56
what it's like a big movie playing in
18:59
heaven because to them it's happened
19:02
of of god coming into this country
19:05
laying his hands on it turning it red
19:08
for righteousness and also for what is
19:10
right
19:11
yeah he's only touched it too late they
19:13
can't come in their little black evil
19:16
cells and and think i'm taking this and
19:18
here's the power of god in the life of
19:20
god laid in our country that's what
19:22
they're trying to walk on and run on and
19:24
let me tell you what there's going to be
19:25
some slipping and falling like you never
19:27
saw before because when it begins to
19:29
rise up out of the ground this is how
19:31
the spirit realm works when that begins
19:33
to rise up it got laid on our country
19:37
and he laid it down and like the
19:40
beginning of 2016
19:42
and he was telling me to say even louder
19:44
let the show begin that was his show
19:46
this is not satan's show wicked man show
19:49
this is god's show wow it's got comedy
19:53
it's got excitement it's got drama you
19:55
see all the drama it's got exposure in
19:58
it for the evil uh it is a big show and
20:01
it's not like it's a joke it's really
20:03
real i know that but if you saw god's
20:05
viewpoint
20:06
the show has begun and it isn't over and
20:10
guess what at the end is victory and
20:12
celebration so god talks a lot about
20:15
that's why i talk about victory and
20:16
celebration you know celebrate and eat
20:18
kate eat little pieces and i already
20:20
tell people we're gonna have a glory
20:21
diet when this is all over that's good
20:24
so when you've been to heaven multiple
20:26
times hundreds and hundreds of times
20:28
have you ever seen the lord rubbing his
20:30
hand saying man i don't know if this is
20:31
gonna work out
20:35
never once never
20:38
and i have i mean i have seen when i say
20:41
them that's the trinity okay
20:43
when i've seen them
20:45
they laugh a lot yeah i'm not laughing
20:49
at the devil good laughing at the devil
20:51
who thinks i have everything he's always
20:53
saying i got it now that's what the
20:55
devil says i got it now i got it i sort
20:57
of like i don't know whatever
20:59
but he hadn't got nothing but fair
21:01
because he is the biggest loser that
21:03
ever existed
21:04
i think he must have been branded with a
21:06
big l on his forehead that'd be
21:07
interesting to see that
21:09
because he thought listen if this person
21:11
is dumb i mean i don't use a word
21:13
lightly if he's stupid enough
21:16
no intelligence almost left in his
21:18
entire head who lives in heaven with the
21:22
trinity and thinks he's taking over
21:27
do you think he's numb enough and stupid
21:28
enough try to take over the earth i
21:30
would say yes he probably is he has not
21:32
any marbles left in his head whatsoever
21:34
um i think the demons play marbles with
21:36
him or something i'm not being funny i'm
21:38
being serious wow
21:40
because something happened when he was
21:42
kicked out of heaven part of his brain
21:44
did get seared by the lightning bolt you
21:46
can't be hit by a lightning bolt from
21:48
god lightning in heaven is blessings and
21:50
love he was kicked out of heaven with a
21:54
million megawatts of love on that
21:56
lightning bolt
21:57
and ever since then was planning and
21:59
planning to take this earth and now this
22:01
is what robin and i heard robin say a
22:03
little bit the other day that that satan
22:05
was making his move to try to push it
22:07
when he said push it push it ahead of
22:09
time right like perhaps time people it
22:12
lives in god it comes from god here's
22:14
the one you thought he was going to take
22:15
over kicked him out right he has no seat
22:17
there no power there whatsoever and the
22:19
only power he really has over us is what
22:21
we give him or allow him to take or we
22:24
participate with him those are our
22:26
family members let's go this is still
22:28
the show this is still the show's going
22:30
on
22:30
and now i'm telling you what the angels
22:32
are sitting watching except not the army
22:34
the army is extremely busy yeah to our
22:37
fam our family members who have gone
22:38
before uh we
22:40
you said many times about they they are
22:42
allowed to look down to portals to see
22:44
special events weddings and births and
22:47
parties and things like that whatever
22:49
god allows them to see
22:51
do they know about this stuff that's
22:53
going on on the earth at all or are they
22:55
kept from knowing this what what i'll
22:57
tell you what they've seen they've
22:58
already seen the show steve oh really
23:01
how so we've already seen the show many
23:03
times he will actually show them if
23:06
there's a movement going on in the earth
23:07
there's a time that's his time on there
23:09
she shows them the end already in heaven
23:12
so they're not up there going oh no
23:13
what's going to happen to them they're
23:15
up there celebrating and saying
23:18
you know like go holy spirit go god go
23:21
jesus
23:22
they've already seen the end of that
23:24
show that we're in right now
23:25
okay that's really good all right here's
23:28
a question i'm going to skip forward to
23:30
number five so if you're watching this
23:31
illumination she and i share the same
23:33
list
23:34
this kind of taps into what we're
23:36
talking about and then a woman named
23:38
debbie asked what's the difference
23:39
between the kingdom age which i think
23:41
the lord announced to you on uh 2012
23:45
and what's the difference between that
23:47
and the millennial age do you
23:49
can you describe it because they sound
23:52
similar like the kingdom age
23:54
and the millennial age people would
23:56
think those were the same things so
23:57
what's the difference no they're not the
23:59
kingdom age is where we actually we
24:03
as the body of christ operate in that
24:05
kingdom that christ always talked about
24:08
it is a spiritual kingdom you operate in
24:10
spiritual power and authority it's all
24:13
connected to heaven but it's our
24:15
operations on the earth so when jesus
24:18
takes over the millennial age it's a
24:20
whole new age and actually the kingdom
24:23
age goes all the way up
24:25
into the into the millennial age where
24:27
some people say are not it's not going
24:28
to happen well you need to go to heaven
24:30
and see god's timeline all right because
24:32
i do know what will happen
24:34
no this is us walking in power and
24:36
authority on the earth because of christ
24:38
with him uh changing and shifting all
24:41
kinds of things because he wants it done
24:44
and needs it done until the day when of
24:46
course that that battle happens at the
24:49
end of the kingdom age at the end of the
24:52
kingdom age which includes the perilous
24:55
times the tribulation at the end of that
24:57
time
24:58
when satan is bound and thrown in the
25:00
bottomless pit for a thousand years
25:01
christ takes the throne
25:03
in the city of jerusalem
25:06
in this natural world and rules
25:09
as king of this world
25:12
that's the millennial age so this is uh
25:14
walking power and authority the kingdom
25:16
age is a whole new time on the earth
25:18
because of the revelation we have an
25:20
understanding of who we are we will
25:22
begin to shift things for god and i'm
25:25
saying i'm not going to give the
25:26
fullness of that yet but we were walking
25:28
upon authority not having any fear of
25:30
the enemy crushing darkness pushing it
25:33
back operating with the army of heaven
25:35
it's our time to shine
25:37
it's hard time to do that for him at the
25:40
end of those days
25:42
will be the millennial age where christ
25:44
himself will be sitting on the throne he
25:47
won't need us to do that people
25:49
yeah and the 2012
25:51
am i right was that when god announced
25:53
the kingdom age 2012 yes yes we stepped
25:56
off a threshold of time and we stepped
25:58
into the kingdom age in 2012.
26:01
okay and i i told people on this show
26:03
before
26:04
my uh
26:05
spiritual father way taylor who's gone
26:07
home to me with the lord was telling me
26:09
that in 2012 that we had entered the
26:11
kingdom age and i thought where is he
26:13
getting that you know well he obviously
26:15
received it from the lord he's been
26:16
caught up in heaven himself
26:19
so he said that and there was a uh older
26:21
man who's now gone to be with the lord
26:23
arthur burt
26:25
there's a arthur burke with the k arthur
26:27
who's the older one he began to prophesy
26:30
this in 2012 that the he talked about
26:32
the
26:34
the flaw of the spirit that would not
26:35
even ab again or something and he
26:37
probably was 2012. so there are multiple
26:40
people you're not the only one in other
26:41
words that got that this is when we
26:43
entered the because i have you you're
26:45
wrong
26:45
people in africa someone in africa wrote
26:48
a book
26:49
saying it's the kingdom age and they
26:51
didn't fully understand what that meant
26:53
they weren't shown into the future the
26:55
kingdom age they knew god was saying
26:57
that and that was also in 2012 i didn't
27:00
even know about them so i had gone to
27:02
the middle of america and declared this
27:04
for god that we have stepped because he
27:06
was telling me to do that so i did that
27:09
we're in the kingdom age right now
27:10
people which means we will understand
27:13
fully what christ meant when he talked
27:14
about the kingdom the gospel of the
27:16
kingdom
27:17
he was talking about the gospel but
27:19
there's a whole kingdom that comes with
27:20
that that's your power that's your
27:22
authority that's your dominion because
27:24
of belonging to him you have you operate
27:27
in that kingdom and you're over the
27:29
darkness
27:31
so all this exposure of darkness has
27:33
everything to do with that there's
27:35
different things he will have god will
27:36
have happened in the kingdom age first
27:39
one understanding you're in a new time
27:41
and then he sets a new person in place
27:43
who will begin to bring the greatness
27:45
here and then even though there's a
27:47
disruption god knows all this and then
27:49
he he had you know
27:52
that people were understanding there is
27:53
great darkness in the earth because
27:55
before most people were ignoring it
27:58
we were sound asleep we thought
28:01
you were sounded asleep let me tell you
28:03
yeah we were sound asleep we didn't know
28:06
that the child trafficking was actually
28:08
going on that the human trafficking was
28:10
going we didn't we we literally because
28:13
and whenever we brought up people would
28:15
say that sounds like a big conspiracy
28:17
theory there's no such thing
28:19
no it was not a conspiracy theory yeah
28:22
wow i mean that's huge in this year that
28:25
we're in 2021
28:27
i think more people in the body of
28:29
christ have awakened than have ever
28:31
awakened i don't know if they're fully
28:32
awake i don't know if we're we're fully
28:34
awake yet in fact i want to segue into
28:37
this question regarding cocaine we're in
28:39
the kingdom it's getting intense now the
28:41
lord already knows what's going to
28:43
happen it's already done in his
28:45
so are there things i'm not asking you
28:47
to tell me what you shouldn't tell me
28:49
but are there things that the lord has
28:51
told you about the kingdom age that
28:53
you're not supposed to release yet and
28:56
maybe what are those type of they're not
28:58
saying tell me if you're not supposed to
29:00
but what are the why would you why would
29:01
he give you stuff to say no don't
29:03
release this yet
29:05
oh i do know this that the revelation
29:07
that he has given that we will operate
29:10
in will totally change everyone's life
29:12
yet he said it will change the way the
29:14
body of christ operates
29:16
so it's much more major than just an
29:18
individual life being changed during
29:20
these days uh it's not just waking you
29:23
up this is what he said you need to wake
29:25
up stand up and stand out so that's
29:28
what's coming
29:29
that's what he wants they need to wake
29:31
up but they need to stand up that means
29:33
stand up and say stuff and then when you
29:35
stand out that's you operating in the
29:38
power of god so he's letting me tell you
29:40
that much he always has like a process
29:42
or a wave a protocol that he does things
29:45
god is not without protocol and planning
29:48
okay he does do that probably more than
29:50
anyone so the whole
29:52
plan for this is happening now
29:54
is for people to wake up and go wow
29:56
there really is evil there's wickedness
29:58
and it does want to take over and and
30:01
he's showing people this is what people
30:03
would live like in some foreign
30:05
countries they do live like this they
30:07
have nothing it's often taken away
30:09
they're controlled
30:10
they own nothing that is the plot of
30:13
satan being worked out by man by wicked
30:16
man
30:17
satan can't take a throne right now
30:19
himself and do what he'd like to do he
30:22
can't do that so he's still using humans
30:24
to do his dirty work that's all i can
30:27
call it he's using humans who
30:29
participate
30:30
and say oh yes i want this i'll make
30:32
money i'll be hell have power and he'll
30:35
make them even feel powerful i'm talking
30:36
about satan but he has no real power as
30:40
far as god is concerned and he shouldn't
30:42
have any power over us at all so what's
30:46
going to happen is when god begins to do
30:49
certain things
30:50
you begin to not just wake up you're
30:52
going to stand up and start saying stuff
30:54
like i'm talking about taking authority
30:56
declaring things to happen in the
30:58
atmosphere and places in the earth
31:00
that's what you should be doing it's
31:02
wonderful to know god is here and yes he
31:04
is he he is in control he owns all of
31:07
this but he wants you as his
31:09
representative as his son or his
31:11
daughter not something else in between
31:14
uh taking authority that you have a
31:16
right to take because of christ
31:18
and so what's coming next is the
31:20
stand-up thing many people are waking up
31:23
they don't know what to do i'm talking
31:24
about believers right now right right
31:27
dude they don't know what to say you
31:28
know should i say be quiet or say
31:30
nothing your voice power in it you have
31:33
such power in the spirit realm because
31:35
you have to remember you see with your
31:37
human eyes right the physical realm you
31:40
don't see unless you're a seer the
31:42
spiritual realm when you say something
31:44
what happens in the spiritual realm is
31:47
satan's plans begin to get crushed
31:50
from the spiritual side
31:52
when they begin to get crushed by things
31:55
you're declaring and taking authority
31:56
over that power is taken away from the
31:59
humans who are operating in wickedness
32:01
this is why it's so important to
32:02
understand who you are that's what
32:04
spirit forces which is why i'm not gonna
32:07
say everything yet but i'm telling you
32:09
you will fully understand
32:11
that's the stand up part but the
32:13
standout part is really those words so
32:16
stay wake up stand up and stand out
32:19
that's god's plan for us in this time
32:23
wake up realize this stuff has really
32:24
happened it's really going on but you
32:26
shouldn't have fear if you're a believer
32:28
you have authority over it where in the
32:31
kingdom
32:32
in the kingdom of age
32:34
so this all going to flow together and
32:36
you know what it'll be almost like
32:37
breathing one day steve when they wake
32:39
up they're already declaring and saying
32:41
things they're stopping things in the
32:43
natural because of what they're saying
32:44
in the spirit realm that's good that's
32:46
how it's going to happen
32:48
so wake up stand up many are starting to
32:51
stand up they're actually saying things
32:52
against what's going on and i'm not just
32:55
talking about taking things to court
32:56
going to the media who will listen but
32:59
i'm saying they really begin to stand up
33:00
and where they live and say things that
33:02
they're not agreeing with it that this
33:04
is not god god's got great plans it's
33:06
important to say god's plans so
33:08
important if you hear a bad report
33:10
always give a good report
33:12
you have to give a good report from god
33:14
god has us under control we're working
33:16
with him we're going to see his hand
33:18
move for us but we have to stand up and
33:20
be on his side and we have to say we're
33:22
on his side okay it makes the difference
33:25
in the spirit realm around you
33:27
and what's in your own soul is very
33:29
important so the stand up part
33:32
is recognizing in your own soul man this
33:34
just been flooding in i'm getting all
33:35
this negative stuff out and ask god to
33:38
put stuff in you can say god i i choose
33:40
my will to bind to my soul your love
33:43
your authority the dominion
33:46
your will your way
33:48
what i have in christ when you say those
33:50
things he'll flood your soul with that
33:52
which will kind of wipe out which is
33:54
part of the dust thing if you come like
33:55
that
33:56
it begins to minimize the impact in your
33:59
soul and the way you think of what you
34:01
choose because to minimize that when you
34:03
ask and bind the things of god to your
34:05
soul yeah let me ask this about you
34:08
until this whole wake up season in these
34:11
last few years
34:12
i've always been taught that when things
34:14
are wrapping up it'll get worse and
34:16
worse one world government
34:18
elites globalists will appear and they
34:21
will begin to try and take control and
34:23
now we're in the midst of the kingdom
34:25
age and you're saying it's not
34:27
that time yet
34:29
so but we know right now cat that
34:31
there's elites out there i'll just use
34:32
the word elites or globalists they would
34:35
rather just control everything and make
34:37
the rest of us you know serfs and slaves
34:40
and whatever
34:41
so is god telling you during this
34:43
kingdom age that whole
34:46
elite thing is going to get
34:48
tamped down destroyed wiped out or just
34:51
less influential what what are we
34:53
expecting god to do with these globalist
34:56
elites who are trying to control us
34:59
i know that some of them well this is
35:01
what he said lose their power
35:03
lose their money and lose their voice
35:07
okay
35:08
and you know
35:10
and and you don't know if it's you're
35:12
not saying if it's
35:14
because here's what i'm one of the
35:15
reasons it's in my mind is when i've
35:17
when i'm asking this question you said
35:19
before there's going to come a time when
35:21
if you want to sin you're going to have
35:22
to go to a city where that's
35:25
uh probably because
35:26
there'll be righteous cities where
35:28
there's just almost no sin if i am i
35:30
saying that about right
35:32
there's yes there will be glories of uh
35:35
realms of glory
35:37
cities of glory regions of light it's
35:39
called regions of light steve and
35:41
regions of darkness that's what god
35:42
called okay regions of light will
35:44
overwhelm the regions of darkness in
35:47
other words there'll be more regions of
35:48
light
35:50
where people will go to live in because
35:51
of the presence of god
35:53
sickness this is god there'll be no
35:55
sickness in those cities
35:57
wow wow that's so this is why this is
36:00
why this all has to happen
36:04
it has to happen so we understand you
36:06
have to see the division there's so much
36:08
gray and god says gray is where people
36:10
don't know or don't care
36:12
there is an area even in the spirit
36:14
realm there's those who are in the
36:16
darkness those who are in the light
36:18
and then in the middle is a gray area
36:20
where people can't make the decision or
36:21
their play back and forth in the camp
36:23
because the camp of darkness came from
36:25
the enemy or his camp the camp of
36:27
righteousness is the camp of light so
36:29
there's regions of light
36:31
okay and regions of darkness you'll have
36:34
to live in the regions of darkness
36:37
do evil i mean the crime will be
36:39
outrageous but there will be almost no
36:41
nothing that is counted as illegal in
36:43
the regions of darkness wow they can do
36:45
any kind of perverted awful horrible
36:47
thing
36:48
because it'll be pushed back
36:51
when i said god said crush it and push
36:53
it back
36:54
that's what will be happening in the
36:56
spirit realm
36:57
crush uh the enemy out of whole regions
37:00
and push them back until they won't be
37:03
able to just go into some they won't
37:04
want to go i say better i'll say it
37:06
better holy spirit yeah they don't want
37:08
to go into the regions of light it'll be
37:11
so painful for the demons to go into a
37:13
region of light they won't be able to
37:15
function yeah and what you're describing
37:18
huh well what you're describing yeah i'm
37:21
really focusing on these regions of
37:22
light because i'm saying gee is is the
37:24
lord saying to his believers his kids of
37:28
you know children of god is he saying
37:30
look
37:31
i'm giving you all of these righteous
37:33
cities throughout the earth or
37:34
throughout the united states live in any
37:36
one of them that you want and you will
37:37
prosper and you'll you will be no
37:39
sickness is that what
37:41
or will some people some people it
37:43
doesn't sound like your people are being
37:45
called into regions of darkness to
37:47
evangelize them but maybe that's maybe
37:49
that's just my
37:50
i think that would have to be a very
37:52
special people
37:54
that have very special people
37:56
um the why for the reasons of life is to
37:59
magnify god's power and glory
38:02
and i can tell you when it spreads it
38:04
says it will be known around the world
38:07
if there's only one way that happens
38:09
it's not going to necessarily just but
38:10
by spoken word it's going to be by the
38:12
activities
38:13
of the saints of god and i love to say
38:15
the saints of god because people are
38:16
already bashing you know
38:18
nicholas and saint whoever don't you
38:21
know in the bible we're called saints
38:22
that's right is that true stephen that
38:24
is true that's right to the same welcome
38:27
person
38:28
if you belong to jesus christ you are
38:30
the saints of god this is not what this
38:32
whole thing is about but i just couldn't
38:33
help but put that little
38:35
thing out there well you know it's just
38:37
so well so you're saying that it would
38:40
be the right thing for christians to
38:42
find
38:43
regions of light and just move there
38:45
well i think it's going to be created by
38:47
the saints
38:49
okay okay the glory when these these
38:51
waves of glory will come
38:54
to consume us you have to understand i
38:56
don't we don't have time even in this
38:58
short segment to explain it all i mean i
39:00
know robin knows so much he tries to but
39:03
he can do one after the other you know
39:04
we do it once a week and that's great
39:07
because god wants people to be focused
39:09
on that and again i have to thank you
39:11
and i'm still going to say people you
39:13
need to give to elijah a list of
39:15
elijah's streams because you would not
39:18
be getting this broadcast you would not
39:20
be getting powerful revelation and it's
39:22
nice to have head knowledge about the
39:24
word and head knowledge what people
39:26
researched and looked up and seen but
39:28
revelation comes from the heart of god
39:30
it doesn't come from me at all okay the
39:33
12th grade education
39:35
that doesn't come from me i can't make
39:36
it up i can't even think it up the
39:38
things that god says revelation is one
39:40
of the most important things you will
39:41
get that's when it says man does not
39:44
live by bread alone but by every word
39:47
spoken by the mouth of god that's
39:49
revelation he speaks and his prophets
39:52
speak it but sometimes other people in
39:54
the five full ministry sometimes
39:55
everyday people will get revelation
39:57
but the regions of light and darkness
39:59
they won't happen overnight just so you
40:01
know that
40:03
there are some things that actually will
40:04
be a suddenly and begin to change right
40:07
away
40:08
in this next year it's going to start to
40:09
change right away but what will build
40:11
he's building on
40:13
is he will have regions of light and i
40:16
was shown those regions of light that's
40:18
why i can talk about it i saw this whole
40:20
city the light coming from it was
40:22
amazing and thinking god you're really
40:24
in that city this was in the future he
40:26
was taking me he took me there
40:28
and i and he said those that's coming
40:30
from the saints of god who live there
40:33
that's my light in them
40:35
operating and living there permeating
40:38
every structure the ground the
40:40
atmosphere
40:41
and he showed me a line of cars coming
40:44
down 95 who had they had sick people in
40:47
their cars or even dead people in their
40:49
cars and i don't do this right now
40:51
and they were coming to a region of
40:52
light when they pulled over the line
40:55
that was the boundaries of that city the
40:57
people came to life i'm not making it up
41:00
they were healed instantly or they came
41:02
to life
41:03
where's 95 by where is this that you're
41:05
describing is that
41:06
95 runs up the entire east coast all the
41:09
way from the furthest north all the way
41:11
down to miami the i-95 interstate 95 wow
41:15
wow and i saw cars backed up so far and
41:18
they were bringing people to a region of
41:21
light that's incredible where god was
41:24
because they gave themselves to god they
41:27
had no sin in their life and so stop
41:29
telling me you can't sin
41:31
and stop making excuses by saying we've
41:33
all sinned and come short of the glory
41:35
might as well keep sinning well you know
41:37
what you know what you forgot the last
41:38
part of that sentence what is the sin
41:40
he's talking about
41:42
all have sinned
41:44
and come short of the glory of god
41:47
that's what he's talking about you're
41:48
talking about being an old sinner and
41:50
just sinning all day long he's not
41:51
talking about that right he's talking
41:53
about the glory have you made any
41:55
creativity for him have you used your
41:57
life to bring glory to of god in this
42:00
earth
42:01
that's going to change
42:04
because we'll know him so well and be in
42:06
his presence so much
42:08
and be used by him because we said yes
42:11
to use us you can say yes i want to be a
42:13
believer and repent to jesus and get
42:15
saved but if you want more you go after
42:17
that more
42:18
you go after the more but what is coming
42:21
in this country i know i saw it there
42:23
will be one day regions of light where
42:26
people will go to be in that presence of
42:28
god they'll be consumed by the presence
42:30
of god
42:31
if they want to sin they'll have to
42:33
leave
42:34
yeah so when you think there's not going
42:35
to be a change we are not going further
42:37
into darkness right now it's being
42:39
exposed god said what is exposed can be
42:42
taken
42:42
down yeah
42:46
so he's so you're so all of these wicked
42:48
things that we're having is not people's
42:51
eyes being open so they can see how far
42:53
we are now going downhill it's not that
42:56
he's exposing this so people can stop
43:00
the evil cooperate with god is that what
43:02
you're saying yes you need to choose
43:04
what god if you're a believer i'm
43:06
talking to believe okay the world the
43:08
secular world
43:09
is going to be influenced by whoever you
43:11
know i'm sure they're there's some let
43:13
me tell you this i have to say this
43:15
there's more
43:16
right now living in this country against
43:19
the darkness
43:20
whether the believers or a secular world
43:23
are good moral people they're not
43:25
necessary believers they need to become
43:27
believers but they don't want what's
43:29
being dished out to us that's good
43:32
probably close to 80 million are against
43:35
all of it which is the majority of this
43:37
country but the other side it can't sink
43:40
in their own minds are seared
43:43
it talks about your mind being seared
43:44
you can't think normal so those who have
43:46
said yes to the wickedness and evil they
43:48
can only think that they can't even
43:51
think what is good that's why they can't
43:52
plan anything good why can't they play
43:54
any good there's only darkness in them
43:57
so god is exposing to you all of you it
44:00
is present this is how satan operates he
44:03
comes in in certain ways to try to take
44:04
what he wants he'll always find people
44:07
somewhere he did way back in the days of
44:08
noah and ever since then he can always
44:10
talk people into doing wicked things if
44:12
they if they have greed in them and have
44:15
anger or hate or whatever he will go
44:18
after those people to use them to be
44:20
leaders but we who are already in the
44:23
light who are filled with christ can
44:24
speak against those things i'm not
44:26
saying you have to go to the doorstep
44:28
and do it either but you shouldn't just
44:29
be repeating the horrible things as
44:32
being said by those people you should be
44:34
saying what god says he's exposing the
44:37
darkness it will be taken down he will
44:40
clean a platform so that we can operate
44:42
freely in these days of glory coming on
44:46
the earth he already put part of the
44:48
glory in the foundation in the very
44:50
ground you put his hand on it and put it
44:52
in there so when it comes from above and
44:54
beneath guest is going to get caught in
44:55
that smack i can tell you he's got
44:58
powerful plans he's not ignoring us he
45:01
is working out his plan and there will
45:03
be nobody escape
45:06
there's been a part of all that kind of
45:07
controlling they won't escape
45:10
and he assures me of that all the time
45:13
justice has actually already been sent
45:15
he's just waiting to release it and
45:18
that's interesting can you elaborate
45:19
that a little bit more you said it's
45:21
been sent
45:22
so it's here
45:24
but he's not
45:26
um initiating it somehow he's not
45:28
anytime
45:30
god will send things many times ahead of
45:32
the time it's activated
45:35
and it's waiting
45:37
so you can't see
45:39
those who are waiting to do something
45:41
because these are spiritual things
45:44
okay but i can tell you the spiritual
45:46
realm is the main realm it's the primary
45:49
realm not the physical realm
45:51
yeah the super the spirit realm
45:52
supersedes it was here before it'll be
45:56
here after this physical realm so in
45:58
that spirit realm with how god operates
46:00
but he uses physical
46:02
being here just a minute yeah go ahead
46:04
and get it while you're taking that and
46:06
um well i don't want to interrupt that
46:08
thought so go ahead
46:10
he uses us to carry out things he wants
46:13
done on the earth
46:15
so if everybody starts citing oh listen
46:17
all i can listen to stop listening to
46:19
the bad stuff people
46:21
i'm not saying ignore it i'm saying say
46:23
something against it yeah i get up in
46:26
the morning i begin to declare the day i
46:28
declare the day i take authority every
46:30
day
46:31
over anything trying to interfere in my
46:33
life to kill steal or destroy to attack
46:36
me in any way to take things from me
46:38
that are mine i command the host to pull
46:40
down strongholds that's what strongholds
46:42
do they build their self around you to
46:44
do something against you
46:46
but he's given that the army of having
46:48
to pull them down you can't see him you
46:50
can't walk up and take something in your
46:52
hand so some people think it's not real
46:54
it's more real than you are it was here
46:56
before you were
46:59
wow wow
47:02
go ahead go ahead and finish that well
47:04
he really is right now waking up
47:07
not just so you'll be awake and be aware
47:10
it's so you then stand up
47:12
and start speaking against it
47:15
in your own life if every believer just
47:17
started speaking in their own
47:18
neighborhood i'm not the darkness in the
47:20
evil flooding my neighborhood i'm not
47:22
agreeing with any evil takeover i'm not
47:24
gonna i'm not tolerating it in any way
47:26
in jesus name you have left you have
47:29
like loosed bombs in the spirit realm
47:31
against the darkness
47:33
yeah
47:34
and every evil person on the earth no
47:36
matter who they are i mean there's a
47:37
list of names i can't give you but if
47:40
you if you spoke against the evil
47:42
controlling them
47:44
their power they've been operating and
47:46
will be stripped away
47:48
man left on their own has fear that's
47:51
what they live in if they're in darkness
47:53
and the power that's been given to them
47:55
through satan or to operate in or demons
47:58
around them to do that is stripped away
48:00
this is what comes fear and confusion
48:03
that's why you're going to see more and
48:05
more of those people fall upon each
48:07
other tell on each other that's a good
48:10
sign that that foundation that god
48:12
talked about is crumbling you cannot
48:13
have a foundation of evil it never
48:16
stands it won't even stand in the day of
48:19
tribulation because no matter how bad
48:20
satan wants everybody he's never going
48:23
to get them and he isn't going to win
48:25
now that's the main thing you have to
48:26
remember god is not there just twiddling
48:29
his thumbs he already had plans for all
48:32
of this
48:33
i'm not tolerating evil around me i'm
48:36
not participating with it in any way
48:38
whatsoever by gossiping about the bad
48:40
things going on i
48:43
i shoot darts into the heart of the
48:45
enemy that would be satan and all his
48:47
demons when i say i'm not tolerating the
48:49
darkness i have power over i'm speaking
48:52
against all these things have been said
48:54
that we have to do in the spirit realm i
48:56
want them to become like dust
48:58
now can there's people
49:00
something
49:01
there's people we know who are evil you
49:03
said you talked about there's a list and
49:04
most of us could name nine or ten off
49:06
the top of our head who we know they're
49:07
doing evil they're everybody knows it
49:10
they know their name they know what
49:11
they're they've been up they know how
49:12
famous they are for their evil now
49:14
so if i know let's just say i take five
49:17
or six of those who i know who i believe
49:19
are the most evil
49:21
tell me how i should decree
49:24
without getting in trouble with god
49:26
because we're not supposed to
49:28
wish anyone to go to hell because god
49:30
doesn't wish anyone to hell so how would
49:33
we fight against what those specific
49:35
people are doing without praying a miss
49:38
or without decreeing wrongly
49:40
it's what is what they're operating in
49:42
my scarf's
49:44
it's
49:45
they operate because they have given
49:47
themselves to the evil okay and a lot of
49:50
them know they've done that and don't
49:51
care they're benefiting from it some
49:54
actually have had promises from evil
49:56
beings that they will be promoted in
49:58
satan's kingdom which is a joke they'll
50:01
be promoted they'll be honored they'll
50:02
have more than anyone else this is what
50:04
they get they get tormented more than
50:06
anyone else in hell and satan laughs at
50:08
them i'm talking about the highest
50:10
people involved in all this he will
50:12
laugh at them and he will have them and
50:14
he will take them to hell when they die
50:15
that's what will happen to them that is
50:17
their end and they can't change that end
50:20
only by confessing to jesus christ and
50:23
asking him to forgive will they not go
50:26
there because you cannot commit that
50:27
much evil against human flesh against
50:30
babies against god's own against god's
50:33
own
50:34
and not think you're going to pay a
50:35
profit so how do i
50:36

52:59
it through you or i heard it from some
53:01
other prophetic person who said that
53:03
they saw a couple regions that they even
53:05
named that had god had one day turned
53:08
them into like a region of light one of
53:10
those that i heard mentioned again i
53:11
don't remember who it was said that they
53:13
saw las vegas as dedicated to the lord
53:16
is that you that was yes it was
53:19
wow
53:22
i was actually in las vegas i've been
53:24
there like what three or four times
53:27
uh i was invited to speak in las vegas i
53:29
was speaking in reno on a yearly basis
53:32
and first of january i was invited to
53:34
speak out all the time and i would see a
53:36
lot of of course when in las vegas so
53:38
let's talk about las vegas when i was in
53:40
las vegas the first time i went i saw
53:42
uh demon serpents wrapped around some of
53:45
these great big old hotels that had
53:48
gambling and let me tell you the thing
53:50
why another thing that man is
53:51
pornography and prostitution is legal
53:55
yeah it's legal and they follow you
53:57
around and give you up these packets
53:59
these groups that's what they do for a
54:01
living they go around to give it to
54:02
different people and it tells you how to
54:04
connect with
54:06
very defiled defiled places that are
54:08
already there so i saw unclean spirits i
54:11
saw spirits of witchcraft i just tell
54:13
you witchcraft i saw a wickedness in
54:16
high places and these platforms you hear
54:18
me talk about it's what it is it's a
54:20
platform in the spirit realm and these
54:22
demons sit on them and give orders to
54:24
the other demons
54:26
who to mark who to go after because of
54:28
things that they're doing in that you
54:30
know they call that the city of sin
54:31
right
54:32
[Music]
54:33
in the midst of walking down the
54:35
sidewalks and i would every now and then
54:37
say something against something i saw
54:39
the holy spirit would say something
54:40
against us so i'd take authority over it
54:42
and cast it out of that and it would it
54:44
would have to leave it would scream and
54:45
leave it would scream like it was on
54:47
fire or i would just say fire fire of
54:50
god and they would all run and scatter
54:52
they were with these groups of people
54:53
walking around so these are people had
54:55
demons with them that were were working
54:57
in defilement to defile people
55:00
uh and they paid for the department
55:03
but these other big buildings i saw some
55:05
weren't hotels some are places that
55:08
wicked people go to operate from they
55:10
have operations there that are secret
55:12
operations that are wicked and evil and
55:14
i saw them and these like snakes were
55:16
coming in and out of these buildings
55:18
like poking his stuff in there and
55:20
delivering stuff and coming back
55:22
and he said
55:23
those buildings that you're going right
55:25
now i will take my hand one day and i'll
55:27
go shh when he did that every one of
55:30
them were gone every man on every
55:32
building gone wow
55:35
he said and i will put my mark on those
55:37
buildings i would begin to see the mark
55:39
of god either his own personal star
55:41
which we call the star of david was
55:43
actually put on these buildings there
55:46
there was a cross on some of these
55:47
buildings stopped saying the cross is
55:49
irrelevant
55:50
you're throwing away your whole
55:51
salvation you need to know that they
55:53
have crosses in heaven number one jesus
55:54
christ is a carpenter that's his mark
55:57
i bet it's important to him he died on
55:59
one okay anyway i began to see the light
56:02
of god
56:03
come first
56:05
because i talked about it from the
56:06
ground up and began to consume these
56:10
buildings and then all the lower level
56:12
demons who'd been on assignment were
56:15
running screaming like dust out of this
56:18
city
56:19
and god said one day this will be called
56:21
the city of his son
56:24
it will no longer be the city of sin i
56:27
have a market for myself so las vegas
56:30
is gonna be god
56:33
if you think you can't affect your city
56:35
i don't think they're as bad as that
56:36
place okay the stuff that goes on that's
56:39
actually been legalized by people who
56:42
allow it to be legalized when when
56:44
humans give permission
56:46
that's why some areas are darker than
56:48
others they're there in authority giving
56:50
permission for that to happen
56:52
and i don't need to say anything about
56:54
what's going on in other places right
56:55
now they're giving permission but you
56:58
have a voice yourself as a believer you
57:01
have more power in one little finger
57:03
than all these wicked people do because
57:04
you believe in the one who owns it all
57:07
who made it all okay you need to find
57:09
out from jesus christ what he wants for
57:12
you what is your point where's your
57:14
partner
57:15
and all this i know this is to always
57:17
speak life and light to people of course
57:19
you always declare that people will not
57:22
leave this earth until they've known
57:24
jesus christ as their savior you allowed
57:26
you're allowed to offer that
57:29
but there are some
57:30
there are some right now that will not
57:32
have mercy and god has told me i will
57:34
not give them mercy they've gone beyond
57:36
what they know that is so defiled and so
57:40
filled with the darkness and the evil if
57:42
i don't wipe it out it will continue
57:44
okay wow
57:45
yeah
57:46
yeah and you know i've asked you that
57:48
question too about that mercy part and i
57:50
if i believe that you
57:52
that i'm being correct when i say
57:55
usually the lord has shown him when
57:57
someone has become that well known for
57:59
their iniquitous ways they're
58:02
by and large gone they've by and large
58:05
given themselves over is that kind of
58:07
what you're saying
58:09
some of them have some of them don't
58:11
care when they begin to not care about
58:13
life itself yeah not any form of life
58:16
they don't care what they do that is so
58:17
wicked and evil they don't care who dies
58:20
they don't care if they kill everybody
58:21
and because if you give yourself to
58:23
satan satan wants everyone to die i mean
58:25
he wants everybody off this earth he
58:26
wants to take over with his own regions
58:28
of demons that's what he wants but he
58:31
can't do that he doesn't have the
58:33
authority or the power to do it he has
58:35
to use mankind well apparently there's
58:38
enough wicked people now who've been
58:40
placed in different places that that can
58:43
say things to make things happen for the
58:45
devil but you know what
58:47
there he's not god
58:49
he is not god
58:51
okay satan is not god people he was
58:54
created
58:55
as lucifer by god sin and evil was found
58:59
in him by the way god did not create sin
59:01
i need to clear that up he one of his
59:03
accusations bought against him by god
59:06
was uh iniquity was found in him that
59:09
sin wicked evil sin it was found in he
59:13
himself desired and that's why that's
59:16
the only thing he can say is his nothing
59:18
else that was made was made by him god
59:21
made everything in this earth how we use
59:23
it or what we do with it that's our
59:25
decision it's our decision
59:27
but there would be a day when evil that
59:30
person called evil satan will not be on
59:33
the earth they'll still be angry people
59:36
angry leaders in countries who haven't
59:38
received god when that tribulation does
59:40
end there's going to be people on the
59:42
earth that haven't accepted christ
59:44
they're just going to be the people who
59:46
will survive it although people always
59:47
show in movies they've nobody survived
59:49
well who is christ going to rule over on
59:51
his throne yeah and it does talk about
59:54
those people and some of them will be
59:55
kings and he said they won't want to
59:57
bring what they have before him he'll
59:58
say i won't send rain on your land
60:00
because they'll be wicked evil people
60:02
so yes he jesus christ is still going to
60:05
have a say in this earth especially
60:07
sitting on the throne in the millennial
60:08
reign it will happen it's after the
60:10
kingdom age comes that millennial age
60:13
but right now it is a decision ground
60:15
and i hear more people who don't know
60:16
what time it is they say you have to
60:18
make a decision now for christ well
60:20
everybody should every day is a good day
60:22
to receive christ and start operating
60:24
with him instead of giving yourself to
60:26
the other side which is you're never
60:28
going to win on that side but there will
60:30
be regions of light where people will
60:32
sickness will not be able to abide not
60:34
even crime can take place in those
60:36
regions
60:37
wow wouldn't that be no crime no
60:39
sickness uh it's gonna be a little bit
60:42
like heaven on earth i was gonna say
60:43
that it sounds a little bit like heaven
60:45
it's like a pre it's like one of the
60:48
the single most beautiful place and
60:51
situation you would have ever have lived
60:53
in up to that point any human being
60:55
right this side of heaven
60:57
yes that is absolutely true and the
60:59
miraculous will be happening everywhere
61:02
i i like to say this about the
61:03
miraculous it will you'll never become
61:05
familiar
61:06
every time you see a miracle of god a
61:08
suddenly of god
61:10
god given you you know his goodness or
61:12
moving his hand on your behalf you never
61:16
become familiar you're overwhelmed every
61:18
time by his love by his patience with us
61:22
he is long-suffering and i think i
61:24
mentioned this the last time the reason
61:26
why noah had to take 120 years to build
61:28
the ark wasn't because god was trying to
61:29
make noah work
61:31
he offered out of the long suffering of
61:34
god's own lobby allah 120 years for
61:36
anyone to repent that was there
61:38
they would have been on the ark
61:41
so all those wicked people had 120 years
61:43
to tell god
61:45
they were repent for their evil ways
61:47
they wanted to know him they could have
61:49
been on that ark so it was their own
61:52
fault their own a hardheartedness that
61:55
they didn't god didn't need 120 years
61:57
from noah to build the ark he wanted to
61:59
give 120 years for all the evil wicked
62:00
so yes he is long suffering he does want
62:02
to extend his mercy but we
62:05
we have a choice to make with our own
62:07
will
62:08
and right now god wants you to stand up
62:10
with your own and start declaring
62:12
against any evil present that you're not
62:14
tolerating it i serve only the most high
62:17
god i don't serve the darkness i will
62:19
not tolerate the darkness you just say
62:21
that in your own home you're releasing
62:23
stuff in the atmosphere that god can
62:24
actually use against that physical
62:26
darkness that's trying to take over this
62:28
world so i'm not ignoring anything and i
62:31
am not ignorant and very well informed
62:34
by the god who made this world but i
62:37
also know he has a timeline and this is
62:39
not the end it may be the end of many
62:42
wicked people
62:44
but i do ask for mercy you have to add
62:46
that mercy for those who were sucked
62:48
into it forced into it threatened into
62:51
it and they don't want it god make a way
62:53
for them to get out of that in jesus
62:55
name yeah for those i suppose that god
62:58
would seem to have even more mercy if
63:00
they were literally from birth
63:01
victimized sacrificed over and all that
63:04
they didn't even have a choice
63:07
i can imagine the lord giving them extra
63:09
you know attention to make sure they had
63:11
the choice that was never given to them
63:13
so wow wow
63:15
well cat you know i think you know we
63:16
could go on and on i have a list of
63:18
questions but i don't want to tamp down
63:20
anything you've already said i don't i
63:22
feel glad to just ask you if you would
63:24
just pray for the people who are just
63:26
what i'm hearing is a lot of people
63:27
saying this is so
63:29
encouraging why doesn't anybody speak or
63:32
why don't more people speak about the
63:34
encouragement that's ahead of us so
63:35
maybe just pray for those people and
63:38
whatever god fills
63:39
your heart with
63:41
yeah father i thank you for this
63:42
beautiful day that you have made no man
63:45
has made this day no man holds the air
63:48
we breathe no man really says what can
63:51
happen what cannot happen only you alone
63:54
sitting on your throne you have the
63:55
right to say that you in the word made
63:58
this world you made everything ever
63:59
existed your son came and died because
64:02
you asked him to if you think people
64:04
that there is not mercy why did he come
64:06
to die he didn't have to he he agreed to
64:09
do that but he wasted hell on the third
64:12
day he took authority walking as a
64:15
righteous man he was the son of god he's
64:17
also called the son of man he walked
64:19
righteously on the earth hell could not
64:23
hold him
64:24
so it should not be able to hold you
64:27
force you put fear in you you need to
64:31
stand up and start saying i'm not
64:33
tolerating the darkness i'm not
64:34
tolerating the evil around me anymore
64:36
open your front door and kick it out and
64:39
then you say i invite god the god that
64:41
created all things his son jesus christ
64:43
i invite holy spirit to consume this
64:45
property consume our home and then you
64:48
begin to build a habitation for heaven
64:50
which is what we all need around us god
64:53
i speak against anyone trying to control
64:55
hurt a maim or steal people's identities
64:59

67:01
him more things to declare and decree
67:04

think there's testimonies on there and
67:08
it's the one place on planet earth that
67:10
you can give to me online if anybody
67:13
else if you see me on other places
67:15
there's a lot of fake facebooks and
67:16
youtubes out there but i will not ever
67:19
stand here or sit here and say i'm
67:20
asking you for money i won't do that i
67:23
won't say there's some group over here
67:24
you need to give to those are just plots
67:26
to get your money but you can go to
67:28
catcure.com and click on the treasury
67:30
and that is how you can give online if
67:32
you want to and while you're given to me
67:35
please remember
67:36
to give to elijah streams because if it
67:39
wasn't for them
67:40
you would not have these weekly shows
67:43
that have been happening actually since
67:45
october of uh is that 2008 2020 i think
67:50
yeah yeah 2020 all the way from october
67:53
up to election day and then we were
67:55
going to stop on november the 3rd and
67:57
god said tell steve i want one more day
67:59
you know he said that
68:00
one more day i have something to say he
68:02
didn't even tell me on november the 3rd
68:03
it was on november the 4th he began to
68:05
say what had happened what was going to
68:07
happen what people would be thinking
68:09
about it and then he would say what he
68:11
was going to have happen and ever since
68:14
that day we decided to not stop these
68:17
broadcasts that's right you have got a
68:20
lot of gratitude and things to steve uh
68:23
i'm a very um
68:25
i i'm moving the spirit a lot and i'm
68:27
very super busy but this has been an
68:29
anchor that i have no question there's
68:32
no no choice in my life that i do this
68:35
every week because god said you're going
68:36
to do it so because of him because if
68:39
steve has opened the door you've never
68:41
had before i'm not saying they are not
68:43
the prophets but the ones god is
68:45
speaking through and steve knows are
68:47
true and let me tell you if he finds out
68:49
they're not he's going to let you know
68:51
but this is his call on his life and
68:53
he's gone through a lot to sit where he
68:55
is right now
68:57
it hasn't been easy it never is you pay
68:59
a price so i hope you will open up your
69:01
pocketbooks and your wallets and you get
69:04
money and you send that to steve schultz
69:06

14:10
hey cat hi
14:11
yeah that was all for free you got to
14:13
watch all that for free
14:14
yes it was nice getting to see your
14:16
staff though people think you know
14:19
they see you and they think that's it
14:21
and it's not true really you've got to
14:23
have a lot of other people to do things
14:25
that's why it costs money and even
14:28
people say well why do you have to sell
14:30
products why do you have to do that and
14:31
i said well
14:32
because we put money out we have to pay
14:35
money out for all kinds of things where
14:36
you know the building the electricity
14:38
whatever just in normal things but then
14:40
when you have staff involved or if you
14:42
order a lot of equipment and supplies
14:44
and stuff to produce things you're
14:46
putting out
14:47
it does cost a lot of money and god is
14:49
faithful though but the staff is so
14:52
important it really is next to your own
14:54
family i have to say the staff that work
14:57
with you day to day is so important now
14:59
i'm going to be in agreement with what
15:01
you're doing or you're going to have
15:03
issues to believe in that god has called
15:06
you and placed you or he has
15:08
and to show honor and everybody needs to
15:10
show honor to one another
15:12
that's something in this new year that
15:14
we're doing we're going to make some
15:15
changes that's going to really help
15:17
everybody have more fun do things
15:18
together as our staff and we'll be some
15:22
at some point moving into a building
15:24
itself this year which will make
15:26
everything much easier for all of us
15:28
awesome awesome well kat we talked a
15:30
little bit off the air we're going to
15:32
take a twist not a bad twist a good
15:34
twist but
15:35
talk about
15:37
some things i'm trying to decide do i
15:38
just throw it open for anything first or
15:40
should i get to my questions that we
15:41
were talking about off the air what
15:43
would you like to do
15:44
um
15:46
go ahead with the things that are off
15:47
the air okay let's do that
15:50
let's talk about that first okay so
15:52
here's what's here's what the let me
15:54
just introduce it like this uh we get
15:56
lots and lots of emails and we can't
15:58
answer every single one but the probably
16:00
one of the most common
16:02
questions that comes out
16:04
just in general not just with cats show
16:06
but all the shows is they'll say steve
16:08
kat said
16:09
and robin said da da da da da
16:12
and they and they and they'll list what
16:14
it is they said and they'll say who's
16:15
right and basically who's wrong
16:18
and so i was talking to you about the
16:20
and i i it's very important for me to
16:23
tell the people
16:24
you and your husband are good friends
16:26
with robin and his wife robin and rob
16:28
yes we are so we are when you see things
16:32
really really differently at times
16:34
uh this is not a friendship breaker this
16:37
is not a deal break in your relationship
16:39
isn't it
16:40
no it's not okay so
16:43
so what happens i'll just continue with
16:44
the question then so robin had a very
16:46
intense word about the president's life
16:49
and praying for this his safety and all
16:51
that and i brought that up to you you
16:52
don't watch because you keep your
16:55
prophetic uh disconnected so that you
16:58
get your right from god if i'm saying
17:00
that right right
17:01
and i said that to you today about the
17:04
president's safety and what what was
17:05
your initial response about that
17:08
well i had of course um the father will
17:11
talk to me anything that has to now we
17:12
know who president we're talking about
17:15
um
17:16
yeah
17:17
anything comes up about him the father
17:19
will immediately tell me and then i will
17:21
do what is what i normally would do uh
17:24
there is a million hosts with him right
17:26
now in florida let's just say in florida
17:29
in florida right now a strategic
17:31
positions strategic places
17:34
um and their assignment is to be with
17:36
him as long as god is using him for
17:38
specific things they will remain
17:41
so i had done that that was it that was
17:43
the limit that's all he told me to do he
17:45
didn't tell me to um and let me say this
17:48
first i have to say this verse
17:50
when god chooses people to be a prophet
17:53
there that's the office of a prophet
17:55
that's not somebody who's real prophetic
17:58
or they see prophetic things or hear
18:00
them sometimes that is their office that
18:02
is a position
18:03
that gives them a lot of authority with
18:05
god he's going to clearly speak to them
18:07
but he does not tell every prophet the
18:09
same thing and you should never expect
18:11
for those who are new to it you can't
18:14
expect every prophet to say the same
18:16
exact words about the same exact thing
18:17
because we're not going to do that i
18:20
have my whole call in my life as a
18:21
prophet to train the body of christ to
18:23
be powerful
18:25
to know their spiritual weapons and do
18:27
that type of thing but also to know
18:28
about heaven my number one call is to
18:31
reveal heaven to earth i've been there
18:33
thousands of times so i'm going to speak
18:35
mainly about that if god has something
18:37
to say about things going on in the
18:38
earth he'll tell me i will certainly
18:40
tell people and right now we have a lot
18:42
going on in the earth and he shows me
18:44
different parts of that and what to do
18:46
about the different things he's going to
18:47
show robin something different that
18:49
doesn't make either one of us wrong it
18:51
doesn't it's just that he's handling
18:53
that for god and dealing with that i'm
18:55
dealing with the another part of it
18:57
hank's dealing with another part of that
18:58
daniel i mean we all have our part with
19:01
god but one thing we do do is we know we
19:03
each hear god and we'll honor them as
19:07
the office of a prophet and so i would
19:09
encourage people what you're being told
19:11
in the moment um you should participate
19:14
in that like praying for the president
19:16
of course is always going to be
19:17
important and i would just say this
19:19
they've always been trying to take him
19:20
out people
19:22
yeah they could get rid of anyone on the
19:25
earth it would be him
19:27
because he is a big threat but god's got
19:28
him in his hand but robin because it was
19:32
revealed that's what he shares what is
19:34
revealed to me i will share and you're
19:37
never going to be disappointed in
19:39
hearing the voice of god and making sure
19:42
that it is all covered but by different
19:44
ones of us so don't expect us all to say
19:47
exactly the word and i can't validate
19:49
robin i didn't hear that from god i
19:52
can't validate hank he can't validate me
19:55
or johnny in law or any of the other
19:56
prophets we have we're accountable for
19:59
what he shows us and tells us to say and
20:02
to and to share and so that's what we're
20:05
doing yeah
20:07
he wouldn't have us here yeah and i'll
20:10
say this let me add this because there's
20:11
there's that one that just came up and
20:14
the one that we get even more than that
20:15
and you know i i am a perfect piece i'll
20:18
just tell you i didn't used to be this
20:20
way but i
20:21
after knowing cat and knowing robin i'm
20:24
at perfect peace that robin
20:26
holds a position that at any moment of
20:28
the day
20:29
the rapture could happen i think he but
20:32
he also holds
20:33
he also holds and he said on the air
20:35
that what cat's position in his position
20:37
could all be true at the same time i
20:39
don't quite get what he means but i get
20:41
robin
20:43
robin knows what he means and i get cat
20:45
i tend to be like for everything i see
20:48
you know this says this gospel of the
20:50
kingdom will be preached to all the
20:51
world and then the end will come where
20:53
there's about five billion of the seven
20:54
who have not yet had the gospel preached
20:56
them so it's easy it's easy for me to
20:59
say we got some time we got some work to
21:01
do but there's an imminent
21:03
uh in the heart and understanding of
21:06
robin and so and how about how do you
21:08
what else would you like to say about
21:09
that cat
21:10
i would say that um
21:13
it depends on the way god uses a prophet
21:15
also i have to say that
21:17
um some prophets are more stubborn not
21:20
saying robin is stubborn in any way
21:23
but even in the old testament
21:25
and in the new testament there were
21:26
prophets that weren't very happy about
21:28
what god gave them to say but they said
21:30
it anyway
21:31
and uh i can just say that
21:34
you know we we all know that um
21:37
jonah didn't want to say some things
21:39
right and uh but god had him in the end
21:42
say what he needed him to say and i
21:44
think obedience is very key
21:46
uh for the prophet to realize uh
21:48
whatever he is saying i will say it they
21:51
all also they are still individuals we
21:54
are individuals like i i'm just going to
21:56
say this i like different colors i like
21:58
different food i like different things i
22:00
i'm not in a box in that in that that we
22:03
all have to eat the same thing or like
22:05
the same thing so inside our heart what
22:07
we've been raised in what we understand
22:10
and and as pointed out in the word is
22:13
what we will follow but i
22:16
was taken on purpose and shown before
22:19
earth began
22:20
after
22:21
even after the new earth is here god has
22:23
on purpose taking me down his own
22:26
timeline
22:27
and so for me
22:29
i will focus and say what god has shown
22:31
me on his timeline
22:33
not any calendar not anybody's calendar
22:35
anybody else's timeline no matter how
22:37
many are out there i have to say what
22:39
god has shown me on his own and on his
22:41
own we are not anywhere near
22:44
i know sometimes people are impacted by
22:46
the things are going on right now he's
22:48
actually setting up for what's about to
22:50
happen
22:51
the next 100 years would be so key to
22:53
seeing the power and the glory in this
22:55
earth and god is not willing to give
22:57
that up he's going to make sure it
22:59
happens he's going to love all those who
23:01
stand and speak for him he'll honor them
23:03
he'll reward them and so you you trust
23:06
that god knows what he's doing and this
23:09
only thing that will happen
23:11
uh uh you know in the end is what god
23:14
wants to happen his timeline will happen
23:17
his way and on his day and it says no
23:20
man knows the day that the lord will
23:24
return and even that's not the end
23:25
people
23:26
please you need to really understand
23:28
when christ returns is not the end okay
23:31
that's the beginning of another whole
23:33
age you know the millennial age will
23:35
happen that's christ himself sitting on
23:37
the throne in jerusalem it's going to
23:39
happen that's a thousand more years so
23:41
you can't really talk about the earth
23:42
being destroyed and disappearing and
23:44
dissipating and i'm not saying robin's
23:46
saying that or hank or anyone else i'm
23:48
just saying
23:49
it can't happen because things have not
23:51
happened that god in his own words said
23:53
would happen yet rest assured you're in
23:55
the sum of the greatest times that are
23:57
about to happen not the opposite and all
24:00
those who were were pure to their word
24:03
and their understanding
24:04
when they get to heaven they'll still be
24:05
happy anyway
24:08
it's not over until the father says it's
24:12
over
24:13
and we're in the great days that seem
24:15
impossible to you
24:17
but not with god we had some guests that
24:20
have come to us and especially when we
24:22
were in the studio not so much now but
24:24
we had some guests and they would
24:25
describe several different programs that
24:27
they were on one of them they had to
24:29
spell out pages and pages and pages of
24:32
their theology
24:34
to tell the this tv station so they
24:36
would now if they would be allowed you
24:37
know when is the rapture
24:40
you know and i don't i've never seen the
24:42
form but i understand it's very
24:43
voluminous
24:45
um and and i think let me just tell you
24:47
folks that's not us we want to know that
24:50
a prophet is is prophesying they're a
24:52
person of good character they have the
24:54
office of a prophet uh or close to it
24:57
and maybe i'll put it that way their
24:59
character is good their reputation's
25:00
good we're not gonna ask them
25:03
what's their va what's their uh
25:05
position on when the rapture is we're
25:07
not gonna ask him those kind of
25:08
questions it's one of the main reasons
25:11
is
25:11
that particular issue has just split the
25:14
body of christ we don't want to do that
25:15
so whatever your position is say it with
25:18
firm but we won't we will not tend to
25:20
even major on that issue
25:24
and i'm talking kind of out of both
25:25
sides of my mouth because it is true and
25:28
count you've seen this it is true
25:30
that i and we do tend to
25:33
gravitate towards this position which is
25:36
we're going to be here for a while we've
25:37
got work to do it is true
25:39
but
25:40
we are
25:43
the last thing last scripture in the
25:46
adjustment occupy until i come he never
25:50
said sit there and try to figure out
25:52
every day and everything and every month
25:54
so everything lines up with what you you
25:56
assume will happen
25:58
you know it says to occupy that means
26:00
take authority that doesn't mean sit
26:02
around and wait doesn't mean sit on the
26:04
sofa it means you take authority you
26:06
will be active in the kingdom and preach
26:08
the gospel the king be active and
26:10
demonstrating and manifesting who god is
26:13
that's what we're all supposed to be
26:14
doing right now not trying to figure out
26:16
if we have to drag our rapture rug out
26:18
or escape to the mountains he didn't say
26:20
to do any of that
26:22
you're supposed to be busy doing things
26:24
for him until the father says to his son
26:28
going down you know i think of that
26:30
scripture where jesus tells the story
26:32
about there was a master and he went to
26:34
a far away place where he's talking
26:35
about
26:37
the son going to be back with his father
26:40
and and though the servants you know
26:42
were given a task to do
26:44
and then after a while they kept not
26:46
coming back kept not coming back and
26:47
they said he's not coming back so they
26:49
began to beat their fellow servants and
26:51
put them in bondage and and then then
26:54
basically when the master did
26:56
come there was there was trouble to pay
26:59
you know a lot of trouble you know and
27:02
and the bottom line was if the masters
27:04
delay they're supposed to be doing he
27:06
gave them a job to do they were just
27:08
supposed to be doing it you know that
27:09
was what that whole parable is and and
27:11
what was important was how they treated
27:13
their fellow servants a long way that
27:15
was what what he was looking at and and
27:18
so anyway well we could talk about that
27:20
for a lot but that's the fascinating
27:21
thing but just remember folks
27:23
the guests we have on we don't
27:25
pre-screen them that they have to agree
27:27
with everything theologically especially
27:29
as it relates to that now i'm going to
27:31
say one other thing and i'm going to
27:32
admit this is a personal bias we knew
27:35
and felt absolutely convicted through
27:38
our prophets there are
27:40
earlier ones that god was saying he who
27:43
he had picked the man in florida who
27:45
starts with the t that was the man and
27:47
god had not changed his mind so yes in
27:50
that vein that wasn't a theological
27:52
position that was like what
27:54
if you're hearing what we're hearing
27:56
those are the prophets that we brought
27:58
on i will say that so you know we're not
28:00
going to bring someone on
28:02
um there was someone that used to write
28:04
for us and he took a position
28:07
and his position was and this is what he
28:10
said
28:11
he said god said
28:15
deal with it
28:16
biden's president now it doesn't matter
28:18
if he stole he's president now pray for
28:20
him well now he's not riding for us i'm
28:23
not mad at him
28:24
i'm not he's not an enemy but he's not
28:27
riding force he's not a guest
28:29
so that kind of position we'll take but
28:32
we don't we won't ruin a friendship over
28:34
it
28:35
it wasn't a punishment we just didn't
28:37
schedule them for the show or we don't
28:38
schedule his work so i think that makes
28:40
sense so well kat anything else you want
28:42
to share before we get into questions
28:44
the thing i just want to um
28:47
i have to say what god has said to me
28:48
almost every single day
28:50
to keep a heart of celebration
28:53
because that is his plan
28:55
and no matter what you see going on i'm
28:57
not saying it isn't happening i'm well
28:59
aware that's why i take authority over
29:00
it all the time uh make sure you're not
29:03
participating
29:04
when you participate with what the
29:06
darkness is or what the plans of the
29:07
enemy is you're highlighting that
29:10
you're supposed to talk more about the
29:12
power and the love of god and god's
29:15
plans in this time that inspires
29:17
encourages and it just it just dissolves
29:21
fear because you know yourself god's
29:23
never given us a spirit of fear but a
29:25
power love and a sound mind so what you
29:29
should be doing right now in this moment
29:30
no matter what's going on you should be
29:32
walking in the power of god having a
29:35
sound mind and no fear whatsoever that's
29:37
what you should be doing
29:39
good good good cat well i've got
29:42
eight-year-old lana if i'm saying her
29:44
name right with the first question she
29:46
says did jesus always look young
29:49
even as an adult so that's her question
29:52
well i'm quite certain
29:55
that he could not have been young and
29:57
gone to the cross
30:00
he couldn't have been young in the fact
30:02
that um
30:03
you know maybe he didn't look totally
30:05
mature or at his age he was 33
30:08
and we all know that that doesn't mean
30:10
you look sorry sweet and heaven please i
30:12
probably hear that more than anything
30:13
else
30:14
jesus had a light that was in him all
30:17
the time
30:18
and and he was a real character he was
30:22
he knew who he was at that point in his
30:24
life he knew he was the son of god he
30:26
knew that all of creation was made by
30:28
him he walked with such uh confidence in
30:31
this earth
30:32
knowing he made this and he came to die
30:35
for those who were on the earth that was
30:37
his goal but i can tell you he laughed a
30:40
lot and a lot of people don't see him
30:41
that way they seem only serious or
30:43
fierce you know when he up up ended the
30:46
whole temple courtyard and everything
30:48
because they were doing things wrong
30:49
there that's why he did it but he was
30:51
focused on what god sent him for what
30:52
his father sent him for to let people
30:54
know the truth to let them know that
30:56
you're not supposed to be afraid even he
30:57
taught about not being afraid of the
30:59
darkness so he walked in confidence but
31:02
it made him a little bit bold he was
31:04
bold but he was liked very much even the
31:07
sinners liked him because guess what he
31:09
didn't speak doom and gloom to people
31:11
even back then he took about the power
31:13
of god the life of god the light in us
31:15
you know why he came and and i think
31:18
that that probably would set him apart
31:20
he probably seemed maybe had that spirit
31:22
of youth in him since he was actually
31:24
eternal right and i think that's more
31:27
than what she she's talking about he
31:29
always had so much life in him there was
31:32
nothing that even probably was even
31:34
close to even aging but he did reach the
31:36
physical age of 33 he was strong even in
31:40
the natural he was strong he lifted
31:42
trees he built he was a carpenter he
31:45
used timbers he moved those himself so
31:47
he was strong he was in great shape he
31:49
was happy at the light of god in him uh
31:52
people wanted to be with him all the
31:53
time so i can see that he had that
31:56
spirit of use or life in him so as far
31:59
as that goes yes
32:01
he always acted like he was he was never
32:04
would probably act that he was an old
32:06
person at all nor did he even think that
32:08
way he loved to be with children also
32:10
all the time which to many people back
32:13
then probably would have been more of a
32:14
a chore or something like that he never
32:17
felt that way he liked the life the
32:19
imagination uh the belief that they had
32:22
and so in that spirit of youth i think
32:25
that's probably always going to be in
32:26
him good good all right now i've got um
32:30
this is it says i i
32:32
imc ega so i don't know if that's a name
32:34
or a username it says username here
32:37
and the question is is god's hair like
32:38
pure wool as described in daniel
32:41
7 9 says cat cat said she touched it
32:44
could she run her fingers through woolly
32:47
hair i guess that's the way she wrote it
32:49
now i i need to make a slight
32:51
correction which i rarely do they said
32:54
white as wool white as well did not say
32:58
it was wool it is not woolly
33:00
he was talking about you know that was
33:02
something he could equate to back in
33:04
that day you have to understand you
33:06
think of the culture of the day
33:08
the sheep the sheep who were like the
33:10
pure sheep whether they their wall was
33:12
white it was extremely white and they
33:15
would stand out with their black faces
33:17
if you never actually saw a sheep you
33:18
should go look it up uh back in that day
33:21
their their their wool was very white
33:24
and it was highlighted by the black face
33:26
that they had black wolves and so maybe
33:29
you never thought about that but god's
33:30
hair is no way is it woolly jesus is not
33:33
wooly it said it was white as
33:37
because on the earth they couldn't have
33:38
anything else that they could at that
33:40
day think of to compare it to
33:43
his hair was not his hair was alive when
33:46
i touched it life shot into my arm it
33:49
shot up my
33:50
spiritual
33:52
and i'm always um
33:54
somebody had painted a painting of a
33:56
horse believe it or not with other
33:58
colors mixed in it but when i looked at
33:59
that picture
34:01
it i saw the face of god in it
34:05
and uh but i don't want to equate him to
34:07
looking like a horse but like the mane
34:09
on the horse was the most beautiful
34:11
hair i'd ever seen on a horse but
34:13
literally i don't think they realized
34:15
that they painted what was imposed over
34:18
that looked like the face of god i mean
34:20
it looked like
34:21
that
34:21
his eyes are flames of fire real flames
34:24
of fire but his hair uh the father's
34:26
hair is like longer than jesus's hairs
34:30
it's beautiful his fear is amazing but
34:33
life is in every part of his being and
34:36
when i barely touch the
34:38
strands of his hair i even now right now
34:41
having goosebumps taking him out
34:43
life was in his hair it was like moving
34:46
not moving a lot but it was moving
34:48
because it was life in it it was the
34:50
whitest white i'd ever seen light was
34:52
coming from it
34:54
and i'm sure that's why they tried to
34:56
describe him he said it was white as
34:58
wool
34:59
it's about the whitest white i've ever
35:00
seen and again because the father can do
35:04
what he wants to he can either let all
35:06
of the glory come from him where you see
35:08
nothing people been they haven't seen
35:10
nothing but
35:11
maybe images of eyes or the shape of a
35:13
head he has so much glory pouring from
35:16
him but he really wanted to establish to
35:18
me he has a body his arms his legs has a
35:21
torso even though he's got the spiritual
35:23
body it's real it's very real and he'll
35:27
reach out and he'll hold you when you
35:28
get to having them if he lays his hand
35:31
on you sometimes he'll just walk behind
35:32
me and lay his hand on me i get so
35:35
undone i'm talking about on the earth
35:36
sometimes he will come and just visit
35:39
him briefly and then leave and he
35:40
actually did that in the old testament
35:42
so it's not a strange thing
35:45
and you need to believe in your heart
35:47
that he cares enough about you he's
35:49
probably been with you and you didn't
35:50
even know it if he didn't make himself
35:52
visible
35:54
you maybe felt the presence so powerful
35:56
if you've ever been consumed by absolute
35:58
waves of love that would be the father
36:01
standing near you he is love his son
36:06
carries that love but he is love and and
36:09
but the light coming from the glory
36:11
coming from his hair and his whole uh
36:13
but he condemned that and sometimes when
36:16
you come home to heaven to stay he will
36:18
let you see his face he'll let you see
36:20
the flames of fire that's his passion
36:23
burning for you but his hair it wasn't
36:25
woolly and it never said it was it said
36:28
white
36:29
so it's extremely white it's kind of
36:30
long it is is wavy but like i said the
36:34
waves of his hair
36:37
and i just was so undone just to be even
36:40
near him
36:41
near him at the throne well you this
36:44
gave me two more questions that had just
36:46
occurred to me so i'm going to ask him
36:47
um
36:49
have has jesus ever come to you
36:52
in the form of the line of the tribe of
36:54
judah and if he's coming to you in the
36:56
form of a lion have you can you see his
36:59
jesus face in that lies it seemed like
37:01
what you just described the father's
37:03
face and the horse or whatever um
37:06
almost never has he come in the in the
37:09
no he's just come in person okay
37:11
i mean like you're seeing me i yeah
37:13
because you know he has his he's
37:15
immortal he has his body he has his body
37:18
back from the grave he's got that body
37:20
you can literally put your hands in the
37:22
actually the the the holes are here oh
37:24
wow if they had been here it would have
37:26
pulled off on the cross you know that
37:28
nail could have that the holes are right
37:30
here and if if you're with him
37:33
in heaven somewhere and a breeze blows
37:36
you can see those marks still
37:38
still in the head where the crown of
37:40
thorns were
37:41
but he's so
37:43
amazingly powerful he sat next to me in
37:46
my own home and put his arm around me
37:49
i thought it was gonna melt into the
37:52
of all the things he said on my loveseat
37:54
i'll never get rid of that loveseat okay
37:56
never ever ever
37:58
get on it and feel his presence today
38:00
wow
38:02
when it my home is in stores right now
38:04
because we'll be moving whoever sat on
38:06
it could feel his presence just come up
38:08
around them so
38:11
his anointing and his presence is so
38:13
tangible a lot of people said i never
38:16
could see him if he visited him as i
38:18
felt him i felt him put his arms around
38:20
me
38:21
it's one of the most glorious things and
38:23
in heaven you can see him whenever you
38:24
want to but i've seen him in person he's
38:27
not like i would say he's not a pretty
38:29
boy he's a strong
38:31
looking uh
38:33
god he's strong
38:34
and he does still have muscle
38:37
um
38:38
his physical body
38:40
he was a carpenter okay his hands looked
38:42
like they were the hands of a carpenter
38:44
but if man i'm just telling you just
38:46
want to be near him i could just say
38:48
that
38:49
that's amazing now a minute ago you said
38:52
um and i never thought this until you
38:54
just said it you said
38:56
something like he might have even you're
38:58
talking about he the lord your father
39:00
might have even been with you but you
39:02
didn't know it was him and i'm thinking
39:03
wait a minute is it possible that the
39:05
father visits every one of his kids in
39:08
person
39:09
i think probably at some time in their
39:11
life he probably did
39:14
interesting you have to remember he is
39:16
the father the father he was your
39:18
original father no matter who raised you
39:20
on the earth he is the number one father
39:23
to you because he carried you in him he
39:26
carried you lived in him there's no if
39:28
you could look inside god you would not
39:30
see there's no distance in him there's
39:32
no back to him on the inside this
39:35
glorious river of life and stones of
39:37
fire and little spirits of life playing
39:40
in there that's where you were so he
39:42
carried you before he sent you to this
39:45
earth and planted you you know in in the
39:48
womb of the the mother he he
39:51
carried you and put you like a seed in
39:53
there and uh and then you grew but he
39:56
wants you to know him i can tell you
39:58
that's why jesus's greatest thing
40:00
himself was he what he talked we talked
40:02
about the father all the time because he
40:04
loves the father
40:06
and that was one of his biggest topics
40:08
was talking about the father and
40:09
mentioned him he said he even said
40:11
there's none good but god he was talking
40:12
about his father he was good but to him
40:16
he's the greatest that the father would
40:18
be the greatest to him
40:19
awesome all right this is kind of a fun
40:22
question carla is asking this you know
40:24
there's that thing i live in texas for a
40:25
while you know they say texas there's a
40:27
saying when you live in texas that texas
40:29
is a is a whole other country you know
40:32
they call it a whole other country so
40:33
here's maybe that's what's in this
40:35
carla's mind she says is there a place
40:37
in heaven that is like texas
40:40
i would love to get into her mind and
40:43
say what is she looking for you know
40:45
she absolutely is right there is a place
40:48
like texas
40:50
there's a place that's got um
40:52
the same terrain
40:56
back in this day in this day like i'm in
40:58
the future talking
40:59
um
41:01
on the earth you would say oh there's
41:04
herds of wild horses running around in
41:06
texas it's beautiful the river you know
41:09
the the i don't want to name rivers
41:11
because i'm not so good with topography
41:13
or geography down here on the earth and
41:15
having them really good with it
41:17
but but you would see certain things in
41:20
texas in the state of texas there's a
41:22
strength in texas
41:24
uh there's a frequency in texas itself
41:26
that god made of freedom he actually
41:29
planted freedom in texas
41:31
and uh not that he didn't put it
41:33
somewhere else but some there's some
41:34
states or some regions or even some
41:36
countries he actually put more of
41:38
something in the foundation of that
41:40
whole area and texas wears freedom it
41:44
does they had to fight for their own
41:46
freedom back in the day and by the way
41:48
they wouldn't mind doing it right now
41:52
but in this part i know because we're
41:55
just going to go crazy right now we're
41:56
going to probably get people's people
41:58
going to love all this and they won't
41:59
i've seen people went home to to texas
42:04
it's a whole lot of the west who live in
42:07
this western that looks like the west
42:10
and not wild though maybe the holy
42:12
spirit would show up he'd be wild but
42:15
but there are areas in in heaven that
42:17
look like the west they just are and
42:20
someone in particular i have seen
42:23
absolutely in heaven would be john wayne
42:25
i don't mind dropping names people i've
42:27
seen him there what is he doing making
42:30
cowboy movies what did he do on the
42:31
earth all right you use your gift in
42:34
heaven and i saw him making a cowboy
42:37
movie uh in this place that looks just
42:39
like the west except there's no bandits
42:41
okay you're not gonna roast get scorched
42:43
be bit by scorpions none of that happens
42:46
so in your natural mind you always go to
42:48
well this is there and it's not there
42:50
it's a glorious beautiful place but it
42:52
looks just like the west and i happen to
42:54
know he lives in this part
42:56
john wayne lives in that part of heaven
42:58
he loves that part of heaven it's got
43:00
rivers running through it off of the
43:02
crystal sea but it to me when i saw it
43:05
looked like the west
43:06
and so yes there is areas that look like
43:08
the west there's places that look like
43:10
it snows all the time
43:12
that has fall all the time and like i
43:15
love what the hell the father explained
43:16
to me why we have seasons here
43:19
we have a season you know that comes and
43:21
goes right like the winter
43:23
spring comes and goes but in heaven they
43:26
are like that all the time and the
43:28
father said when i made the seasons on
43:30
the earth i took a shadow of four of my
43:33
favorite places in heaven more than four
43:36
don't say i said there's four places i
43:38
took a shadow of four of my favorite
43:40
places in heaven and put on the earth as
43:42
seasons
43:44
wow that's amazing that is amazing now i
43:47
got to ask you this because there's
43:48
something you just said you said you're
43:50
not so good with the topography down
43:52
here as you are in heaven
43:54
which begs the question you've been
43:56
there so many times if you were to sit
43:58
with a piece of paper
44:00
could you draw out this is where this is
44:03
and this is over
44:05
as as if it was a kind of map would you
44:08
know where you have your orientation of
44:09
where you are
44:11
you know steve you've heard me say many
44:12
times heaven is the world
44:15
that's why the earth is round hello flat
44:17
earth people forget it
44:19
heaven is the world it's around it's a
44:22
round or
44:24
if the earth was made of the shadow of
44:26
heaven then the earth would have to be
44:29
round because heaven is
44:31
so the father's house that jesus talked
44:33
about in my father's house so many
44:35
mansions
44:36
and people have for ages try to picture
44:38
how many mansions can you get in a
44:40
building
44:43
because your mind is earthbound right
44:45
the the house that the father calls it
44:47
it's a whole world it's a whole world
44:49
and i pretty much could draw kind of
44:51
what's at one of the tops and what's i
44:53
can tell you what's on the bottom of the
44:54
world called heaven that's michael's
44:56
headquarters oh really really yeah
44:59
because they're saying they're sending
45:00
them to the earth it makes sense right
45:02
it's what it's way up beyond anything
45:04
you can see
45:06
you're not going to find heaven with no
45:08
no telescope and no no a satellite or
45:11
anything you will ever see heaven
45:13
because it's a spiritual world a literal
45:16
place where you live literally in your
45:18
spiritual body uh it's an unseen it says
45:21
that what was made that is seen was made
45:24
by that what was unseen so there's a lot
45:26
of activity up there in the spirit realm
45:28
uh that you in your mind couldn't even
45:30
possibly imagine but but god from where
45:34
he sits can see everything it actually
45:36
says the earth is his footstool
45:39
so you know he had to shrink himself to
45:41
come and walk on me yeah well right
45:44
but he had to shrink himself and where
45:46
are his foot touched the mountains they
45:48
set on fire there was a fire so if you
45:51
think he's unaware of what's going on
45:52
you don't know him
45:54
yeah
45:55
so yeah so this earth is a shadow and a
45:59
type of what is in heaven
46:01
but also even the way he made it so
46:03
there's mountains there's rivers there's
46:05
an ocean in heaven called the crystal
46:07
sea
46:08
um there's there's the there's places
46:11
that look like the west it looked like
46:12
the north it looked like
46:14
uh the south there's places that look
46:16
like spring okay
46:18
there's many places what i could do and
46:20
actually have sketched myself in a lot
46:23
of my journals and one day we will
46:26
actually make a movie we are going to
46:28
make a movie it would take you to these
46:30
little places in heaven that i was shown
46:32
i don't think i connect i could connect
46:34
the whole world together but there are
46:36
places and i know what's near them those
46:39
i could do something like that awesome
46:42
awesome yeah
46:43
it never occurred to me that you i know
46:46
you might if you were going to walk it
46:48
or fly it on your own go down here turn
46:50
left here
46:52
i mean you would know certain places you
46:54
would know where they are maybe i never
46:56
i always have people with me so i don't
46:58
get lost in the airport okay yeah i do
47:01
remember that i remember seeing your
47:03
husband take you by the arm through the
47:05
airport you walked right past this we
47:07
were
47:08
okay uh this person
47:11
lin for christ is their username they
47:12
want to know what what is the book of
47:15
records i don't know if that's
47:17
i don't know if there's a if you've just
47:19
talked about that i'm not sure if that's
47:21
the bible term of book of records she
47:23
wants to know what's the book of records
47:25
there are so many books
47:27
i couldn't name them all you think he
47:30
doesn't have one here's my birthday's
47:32
right
47:32
the father is a writer okay
47:35
the lord was the orator he the the lord
47:37
likes to speak he doesn't care to write
47:40
things i just know that about jesus even
47:42
when he was learning the torah he loved
47:44
to read read read he didn't like so much
47:46
to write things that's just the way he
47:48
was but the father is definitely a
47:50
writer he loves to write record in old
47:54
school it was old school to be
47:57
timeless school i guess you'd have to
47:58
say it's timeless he loves to write in
48:01
books there's the lamb's book of life
48:03
that's a whole different one he has a
48:05
book of remembrance that's a whole
48:06
different book
48:08
but there are things that are recorded
48:09
there's actually a hall of records
48:11
there's a whole hall where things have
48:13
been recorded over time
48:15
accurately recorded by him
48:18
so there's a whole hall of records
48:20
there's one that pertains to you
48:21
yourself and things in your life there's
48:24
there's your own book he wrote i wrote i
48:26
wrote you know your your book for you
48:29
every day of your life he wrote it in a
48:31
book that's a whole separate book that's
48:32
just for you so there are books of
48:35
records there's a hall of records um
48:38
there's so many different places to go
48:39
and see and be be a part of in heaven
48:43
you'd have to be here for eternity to
48:45
even begin to be part of it um but
48:48
there's beautiful places that record
48:50
things there's different ways no things
48:52
are like we would say video audio they
48:54
don't call that in heaven they just
48:56
things are captured
48:58
they capture things and say that you
49:01
don't say they read they don't record
49:02
they capture them
49:04
which when they capture something or
49:06
they have retained something it's what
49:09
it felt like what it smelled like what
49:12
was said what was done really uh it was
49:14
very accurate but for he for himself
49:17
he does have a book of remembrance
49:19
that's his favorite book to write in so
49:21
he he doesn't have to but he does it
49:24
because he wants to do it and he
49:26
remembers every kind thing let's just go
49:28
there every kind wonderful thing you've
49:31
done for him every person you've helped
49:33
every person you fed every time you uh
49:36
picked up a wounded animal i mean animal
49:38
health whatever it was it was kindness
49:41
he records and remembers that
49:44
and then when you pray
49:46
when you pray and say father uh i really
49:49
would like to have this or i need this
49:51
now he goes back to your book and
49:52
remember says look at all the kind
49:54
things they did for me look how they
49:56
treated this person even when they
49:57
weren't nice so i can tell you
50:00
that's good there are books of records
50:03
halls of records in heaven so and but
50:05
much of it is very beautiful wonderful
50:07
things it's not always like they're
50:09
writing every bad deed done when you get
50:11
born again that's kind of like wiped out
50:14
if you if you repent for your sins it's
50:17
like you never did them you need to
50:19
remember that and you've been sinning
50:20
lately please go again again
50:23
please repent again god didn't never
50:25
give us the ability to freely sin once
50:28
you get saved people actually believe
50:30
that and some even teach that he never
50:32
said that it said since grace of balance
50:35
should sin also bound in god's head god
50:38
forbid so because there's grace for
50:41
eternal life and grace for forgiving you
50:44
that doesn't mean you should just live a
50:46
sinful life you're not you're not doing
50:48
anything good for god even for yourself
50:50
or your destiny so we're just kind of
50:52
went there because of the record thing
50:54
but when you do repent no matter what
50:57
you've done you sincerely repent god
51:00
wipes it away and doesn't remember it
51:02
because remember the books of
51:03
remembrance are the good things right
51:06
the book of records might be other
51:07
things and when you pretend that part is
51:10
wiped out that's like that you never
51:12
know
51:13
and you said that they don't use the
51:15
word video and audio but they capture it
51:17
and it's like a 3d
51:18
movie video thing yeah
51:21
in our language but if a person goes to
51:23
heaven and wants to look at their life
51:25
and they're not going to see sin that
51:26
was forgiven or they wouldn't even be
51:28
there but would they be able to see
51:30
things like that time they went through
51:32
an intersection and an angel came and
51:34
did this to this car and would that kind
51:36
of thing be recorded
51:38
it would be recorded but also would be
51:40
all the funny silly things you did
51:44
like like like what like when you were
51:46
in your pre-teens in your early days the
51:50
wow like you know i'm gonna jump this
51:52
canal like he will
51:53
see how that worked out and of course it
51:55
would be miserably fail but you wouldn't
51:57
get hurt but funny silly things you did
52:00
you will see that you actually go to
52:02
these they actually have a place where
52:04
your friends and your own family when
52:07
you get to heaven you're not going to
52:08
escape seeing that movie because they're
52:10
going to take you to see it
52:11
and uh it'll be delightful this is like
52:14
the silly things you did that he rescued
52:16
you with like
52:18
sometimes you didn't get rescued
52:21
you know maybe some of the fashion of
52:23
the day when you dress like i don't know
52:25
emcee hammer or something
52:27
would they show things like
52:30
um i love anthony by the way he's a very
52:33
cool person yeah yeah um would they show
52:36
things like um
52:38
how the lord when they show how he
52:42
talked to this
52:44
person to come share the gospel like
52:46
that where they would show how he got a
52:48
hold of how your life was
52:50
apprehended through the through other
52:52
people would they show that kind of
52:53
thing i think you definitely
52:55
i think you probably absolutely see that
52:57
i know that you will see this is what
52:59
you do see
53:00
you see your life relive with the
53:02
operations of the spirit realm from
53:04
heaven's perspective oh
53:06
every time your life was rescued every
53:09
time uh a god intervened that you didn't
53:12
know about you'll see all of that okay
53:16
very cool very very good born again of
53:17
course when you get born again but once
53:19
when you see yourself get bored again
53:21
you will flash up to heaven in the video
53:24
or this movie and you'll see how all of
53:26
heaven celebrated including father's day
53:29
when you got born again
53:31
how they celebrated yeah yes yeah that's
53:34
always been a hard one maybe you've seen
53:36
what you're talking about but
53:38
on the earth there could be a in a given
53:40
day even though we've heard of so
53:44
many people get saved in china and
53:46
underground church but there could be
53:47
hundreds of thousands of people getting
53:49
saved today coming to the lord and yet
53:52
when i see that scripture it says
53:53
there's more joy in heaven over one
53:55
sinner who repents and and so how does
53:58
it seems like
53:59
heaven would be constantly in a state of
54:01
celebration maybe it is how do they all
54:04
have a rejoice is it that is that what
54:06
they're doing is constantly celebrating
54:13
well
54:14
they do celebrate all the time people
54:16
and especially their families or friends
54:18
or something like they're really going
54:19
to celebrate uh that their family member
54:22
got born again oh they can't stop
54:24
talking about they go all over heaven
54:25
and talk about even for the people
54:26
really really celebration is such in
54:29
their heart knowing that forever they'll
54:30
be together for eternity so it is a big
54:32
thing it's a big thing to know that your
54:34
family members got born again so
54:37
to use it in a practical way uh let's
54:39
say i and my wife uh went to heaven one
54:42
you know events different times now
54:43
we're friends and uh maybe our
54:46
grandchild was not was walking away from
54:48
the lord okay a grandchild now they're
54:50
all just babies almost
54:52
but if
54:53
at the time when that grandchild comes
54:56
to the lord
54:57
i'm running up to drain or she's running
54:59
up to me and said did you hear
55:02
so and so got saved right is it kind of
55:04
like that
55:05
huh well actually what what actually
55:08
happens is the father lets you know
55:10
right before it happens and you watch it
55:13
you go to this
55:14
design where you can look down on the
55:16
earth and you declare over your family
55:17
members and stuff and there's like these
55:20
columns around heaven and when someone's
55:22
face comes up on these different columns
55:25
or like big monitors they know on those
55:27
columns when it comes up they're about
55:29
to get born again so they will run into
55:31
one of these portals that are
55:33
huge places you walk you run up these
55:35
steps and look over the balcony you
55:36
actually can watch your family members
55:38
getting born again
55:39
then the whole place breaks it the whole
55:41
place celebrates every time so if you're
55:43
there with a thousand people watching
55:45
the family members you can imagine the
55:46
celebration going on if they're all
55:48
there to watch their family members get
55:50
born again yeah well it's like they're
55:52
all looking down but they're sitting
55:53
down
55:54
wow okay uh this person wants
55:58
to know can you command demons out of
56:01
somebody without the permission of the
56:02
person you're praying for and i guess
56:05
i mean that's deliverance so i don't
56:06
know if there's a special
56:08
what they have in their mind whether
56:09
it's a ministry setting
56:12
you can certainly
56:14
cast a demon out of somebody right
56:16
without their permission i'm not sure
56:18
it actually says in the bible that's
56:20
what christ gives us the power to cast
56:22
out demons you know he says that right
56:23
he says that so anywhere where you are
56:26
if you're in authority if you have the
56:28
understanding of what's going on usually
56:31
the holy spirit will move on you to
56:33
he'll just say cast out that demon and
56:34
you will do in jesus name i i've done it
56:37
many times in different places and it
56:39
didn't even have to be like a church
56:40
setting it didn't and that wasn't
56:42
anything that was planned um you know
56:44
outside of a theater or something and if
56:47
if it manifests that means if you see it
56:49
the manifestation of one you you have
56:52
every right and authority to cast that
56:54
demon out
56:56
lots of times people aren't even in
56:57
control of their own mind anymore you
56:59
absolutely have the right to cast that
57:01
demon out there are some people who have
57:03
them and want them and i know that
57:05
sounds awful but they do and they know
57:06
what they are
57:09
and then they want it you expound what
57:12
do you mean cat they want them
57:15
when they know that they're demons what
57:17
do you mean they want them can you be
57:19
more specific
57:21
well i i i don't know
57:24
about the darkness today but i will just
57:25
say they they talk about people who who
57:28
were there's a difference by the way
57:30
there's a huge difference in being
57:32
influenced by demons and being possessed
57:35
by demons okay oh what we're talking
57:38
about the casting out is someone who has
57:40
one living in them and you that may
57:43
freak you out but jesus lives in you
57:45
okay jesus when you got born again he
57:46
stepped on the inside of you he lives
57:48
there people watch what you're saying
57:51
i always like to say give jesus a good
57:52
day give your angels a good day your
57:54
angels were sent to be with you they're
57:56
also present they're also there uh no
57:59
matter where where you are your angels
58:01
are seen i mean they're seen by each
58:03
other of course
58:04
as a seer you see all this going on
58:06
around you is i have to focus sometimes
58:08
when i go in a place because i'm seeing
58:10
all this
58:11
i'm seeing people's angels i'm seeing
58:13
demons that are trying to speak to
58:14
people they'll try to whisper things in
58:16
your ear that aren't gone that's being
58:18
influenced by one okay a possession is a
58:22
as a whole totally different thing they
58:23
probably can't even think on their own
58:26
or do normally even natural everyday
58:28
things needed for them to live in a
58:30
situation like that
58:33
you better know the power of god you
58:34
better not have sin in you and try to
58:36
cast a demon
58:38
you just need to know that's not going
58:40
to remember the seven sons of skiva go
58:41
back to the bible uh they thought
58:43
because they saw you know all of them
58:45
cast demons out they thought they could
58:47
do the same thing and the demon came out
58:49
and jumped on them i'm not trying to
58:50
scare you i'm just saying what's
58:51
biblical you can't live a life of sin
58:55
even as a christian which sounds crazy
58:57
and think you're going to cast demons
58:59
out they're going to come after you
59:02
so
59:02
if you're operating if you're operating
59:04
and righteously and you have authority
59:06
and you know you have authority and a
59:08
situation like that that would be the
59:09
most natural thing for me to say i cast
59:11
you out in jesus name get out
59:14
he had me do that in a whole
59:15
congregation and this whole massive
59:17
congregation of like 700 people three
59:20
demons literally ran out of the people
59:23
and those people were set free instantly
59:26
from the
59:27
the the the the demon that had
59:30
controlled them either they gave
59:32
themselves to it and i'm saying you
59:34
cannot just go play around in the
59:36
darkness people you should not have an
59:38
ouija board i am sorry that's how you
59:40
contact me you don't want one of those
59:42
you don't want to mess with witchcraft i
59:44
just have to be honest if you want to be
59:46
full of god in these days and walk in
59:49
great authority you don't have to be a
59:51
prophet to do that you do need to know
59:54
who you are in christ and who christ is
59:56
and you walk to please him you you have
59:59
authority over the darkness the bible
60:02
says so you do and there's a whole list
60:05
of things that you have the right to do
60:06
as a believer it doesn't have to be
60:09
necessarily a five-fold person in the
60:11
ministry you as a righteous person have
60:13
great authority in the earth
60:16
but you can't play in the enemy's camp
60:18
in other words you can't decide well i'm
60:20
a born-again believer you know i'm
60:21
operating i'm reading my word i'm i'm
60:23
declaring things and and then decide to
60:26
go to some wicked evil science party
60:30
a guest
60:32
and that guest you wouldn't want with
60:33
you i'm not talking about a physical one
60:35
so you need to you need to be
60:36
accountable for your life and actions
60:38
when you get to the age of
60:39
accountability
60:42
that means you know the difference and
60:43
you know what's right or wrong don't
60:45
play with the darkness
60:47
okay if you want to be safe and powerful
60:49
don't play with darkness um you just
60:52
don't want to do that and i don't even
60:53
know how we got into all that yeah but
60:55
as far as casting demons out we we have
60:58
authority to do that jesus those who
61:00
followed him believed in him who had
61:02
repented of the sins was living
61:04
righteously they had the right to do
61:05
that
61:06
and remember the one man he cast all the
61:08
demons out and prayed over him and then
61:09
he sent him to do the same thing because
61:11
he'd received christ
61:13
but you need to know who you are who
61:15
christ is who is christ
61:17
he made everything that ever existed
61:20
that does exist and will ever exist
61:22
that's who he is
61:24
when you give yourself to him you get
61:26
everything with him you're not giving up
61:29
your few little sins you had or you feel
61:31
little things you like to do and play in
61:34
you're getting a life eternal
61:36
to one day being immortal
61:38
and this is what you're giving yourself
61:40
to it's not just oh no i have to read a
61:42
bible it's not that it's who are you
61:45
giving yourself to because one way or
61:47
the other you're going to participate in
61:49
the darkness or you're going to be in
61:50
the light with jesus christ so i would
61:53
say
61:54
run after him
61:55
get along and say i want to know you
61:57
jesus i want to know you more i want to
61:58
know about you i'm going to be like you
62:01
you're going to start having his
62:02
presence show up because of what you're
62:04
saying okay
62:06
what you say matters in this world
62:09
and so don't be bashing trashing
62:12
swearing profanity is how's language
62:14
people i'm sorry i don't tolerate don't
62:16
ever swear about me don't swear around
62:18
me i'll cast that on you that's good all
62:21
right now i think i may know where this
62:23
came from but let's see okay so you said
62:25
you said in the past everything in
62:27
heaven is alive
62:29
the flowers don't die the grass is alive
62:31
things like that and this person may
62:33
have heard that but maybe i don't know
62:35
if you said the angels took care of the
62:37
flowers but this person says what do
62:39
angels have to do when they take care of
62:40
the flowers do they have to water weed
62:43
fertilize so i don't know what you might
62:45
have said did you say the angels take
62:47
care of them
62:48
okay so what did they do they care for
62:51
them uh they'll go and sing
62:54
they'll release the life of god
62:57
they'll go visit them i mean there's
62:59
there are some that their assignment and
63:01
there's some that care for the
63:02
waterfalls there's ones that care for
63:05
the meadows and the flowers and the
63:07
creatures
63:08
god doesn't have to feed them it's not
63:11
the physical food you're thinking on
63:14
you're connected to earth okay i'm
63:16
talking about heaven
63:17
the life of god feeds everything in
63:20
heaven you eat in heaven because you
63:22
love to eat you don't eat because you
63:24
have to do it to live
63:26
so these these things he made
63:28
that he imparts the life life of god or
63:32
joy they may bring waves of joy to whole
63:34
meadows and the flowers begin to sing
63:36
with joy so there's things that they're
63:38
assigned to do in heaven but it's never
63:40
going to be the fertilizer fertilizer
63:42
they're not going to dig and put plants
63:44
in there okay
63:46
uh if you're a gardener in heaven you'll
63:48
speak and plants will begin to come up
63:50
on the ground oh wow you're gardening
63:52
with your with your mouth
63:54
by speaking
63:55
new things
63:57
that's right very cool very cool very
63:59
cool um here's one i don't know if this
64:01
is a child or not but i know that's a
64:03
serious question but this is does anyone
64:06
go to heaven and not like it
64:10
and now do they what
64:13
no does anyone go to heaven
64:17
there is not one single person who's
64:19
ever moved to heaven and lived there
64:22
and not liked it okay there's so many
64:25
things i don't even have time to tell
64:27
about or share about that exist there
64:30
you're living in an atmosphere of joy
64:34
there's nothing in you that would
64:35
despise or not like it's not even in you
64:39
i know in your head you can't understand
64:41
that because i know you go to a store
64:43
and you go i don't like that outfit but
64:44
i like that one no i would never wear
64:46
that but i sure would like to own that
64:48
it isn't like that in heaven okay you
64:50
love everything you have your favorites
64:52
or you'll go to different places to get
64:54
favorite things that you like because
64:55
everything's just given to you things
64:57
are created to me but it's given to you
64:59
but you're not ever going to say i don't
65:01
like living here
65:03
that is impossible
65:05
you are so filled every bar
65:07
part of your being is filled with the
65:09
life and love of god and
65:11
if anything you love more
65:14
you love your family more you love god
65:16
more you love his house the world called
65:18
heaven you love everything about it you
65:20
get to go on tours and nothing costs
65:23
anything there's no money in heaven uh
65:25
everything is freely given people share
65:27
the gift that they are that they were on
65:29
the earth that only they use it in more
65:31
fantastic ways than they would like an
65:33
artist doesn't just have to paint on a
65:35
canvas their paint floats in the air
65:37
whatever they use to make things it's
65:38
just there they paint with light they
65:41
paint the sky of heaven and it's there
65:43
for a while then it fades and they paint
65:45
something else
65:46
there's no what there's no way you could
65:48
not love being there yeah that's amazing
65:50
all right let's do this this is the last
65:52
one but this is a good one um never
65:54
heard this one but this is this is to
65:56
you cat christie's asking on one of your
65:59
visits to heaven kat have you ever had a
66:02
family dinner with father son and holy
66:05
spirit what did the conversation can
66:07
sound like
66:09
i i've never had a dinner with all three
66:11
of them
66:12
i haven't
66:14
i have visited with them separately and
66:16
they've taken me different places in
66:18
heaven i've i've spent i not i don't
66:20
think i ever ate with any of them okay i
66:23
think i've been in a bakery with jesus
66:25
one time just because he was showing it
66:27
to me he loves sweets yeah every baker
66:30
that comes to heaven he's going to visit
66:31
their shop
66:34
really great i've been in the the i've
66:36
been in the um mansion that is jesus
66:39
christ has his own why wouldn't he he
66:42
lived on the earth as a person okay
66:44
he served god while he was here on the
66:46
earth he has his own yes he's in the
66:49
throne room a lot but he also has his
66:50
own place what does he do he throws
66:53
events there invites people just come
66:55
home to heaven and let them meet all the
66:56
prophets and all the stuff i've been
66:58
there and all he served was desserts
67:01
people so i hope you like dessert you
67:02
had every kind of dessert imaginable on
67:05
this glorious mansion
67:08
and when you walk through the flowers
67:10
are so high they're all greeting you
67:12
you come in this beautiful carriage
67:15
and then he sent for you to invite you
67:17
to his place and there's people there
67:19
you probably always wanted to meet if
67:21
you said i always wanted to meet elijah
67:23
i always wanted to meet queen esther i
67:24
wanted to see david they would
67:26
definitely be there for you and then you
67:28
would all enjoy desserts on these tables
67:31
and he's going to have dancing like
67:34
beautiful dancing and i know in your
67:36
mind you're thinking all these different
67:38
styles of dance depending on what you
67:39
like there's nothing defiling there's
67:41
nothing degrading in heaven but
67:43
beautiful um they dance all over heaven
67:46
all the time usually from joy from
67:47
celebration but everything you you
67:50
usually think about is equated to what
67:52
is in the what's in the in the um
67:55
i'm trying to think of an earth ward
67:57
right now
67:59
they would compromise the area this is
68:02
the best i could do of the throne room
68:05
and even that would be hard for you to
68:07
do if you have not been there the throne
68:08
room is alive it gets huge it grows it's
68:12
round the throne is in the middle of the
68:15
throne room it's high and lifted up
68:17
there's like platforms columns platforms
68:19
columns and there's people and all
68:20
different they're either worshiping or
68:22
dancing or leaving sweets for jesus
68:25
seriously all the way up the steps to
68:27
where this massive throne is the father
68:30
sits and his son sits next to him
68:32
uh you have to walk past these living
68:34
creatures that are so stunning
68:40
to get up there and your eyes cannot
68:42
contain
68:43
uh so it's not like there's little small
68:46
spaces and there's no place for you it's
68:48
not like that you begin to worship
68:49
everybody raises up off the floor the
68:51
seraphim come down out of the glory
68:53
cloud and they're on fire with passion
68:55
and love for them with sin on the throne
68:58
there's no way you couldn't love being
69:00
in this place and so anyone who has
69:02
someone there
69:03
don't ever feel sorry for them that
69:06
they're living
69:08
they're existing to live
69:11
you never die
69:12
there's no thoughts of death there's no
69:14
thoughts of harm nobody's ever sick
69:16
nobody lacks
69:18
everybody still wants to help one
69:19
another with their events and stuff like
69:21
that there's joy celebration no one is
69:23
rejected no one's rejected
69:26
everybody is cared about and loved
69:28
and and the creatures you also can get
69:31
to know all the creatures that they are
69:32
not talking about the living creatures
69:34
they're too busy i'm talking about
69:36
creatures all over the world called
69:38
heaven and the friendly forest is why
69:40
they call it that in the valley of the
69:42
falls uh
69:43
there's just so many beautiful places
69:45
and fun places i can't leave out the fun
69:48
okay
69:49
so no matter what when you know someone
69:51
who's going and you know they're going
69:53
i celebrate
69:55
and i've been celebrating over marcus
69:57
lamb recently
70:00
a great man and woman of god have gone
70:02
home to heaven my whole heart is so full
70:04
for them of the glory they will
70:06
experience just being in the presence um
70:09
of the father of the son
70:11
and holy spirit is still there people i
70:13
know his base of operations is on the
70:15
earth so don't even go there with me the
70:17
holy spirit is an unlay unlimited
70:20
layered being
70:21
i hope that does something to your
70:23
natural head
70:24
unlimited layers of himself doesn't mean
70:26
there's a million of them standing
70:27
around it's not like he's here there's a
70:29
million of them around him it's not like
70:30
that
70:31
the way that he is
70:33
he has unlimited layers of himself where
70:35
he sends that layer of him that looks
70:37
just like him and is him he knows
70:40
everything there here's everything there
70:42
so when you invite the holy spirit to
70:44
indwell you guess what you don't get a
70:46
piece of him you get a whole of him in
70:48
you that's good good good good
70:51
yeah so when the holy spirit you know
70:53
he's when the holy spirit lives in you
70:56
that's not some euphemism or poetry it
70:59
means he himself
71:02
is there uh we would we would use the
71:04
word in bodily form except he's a spirit
71:07
being so it's not and he's killed him as
71:09
a body
71:10
yeah okay so spiritual body
71:13
he's literally there the person of the
71:15
holy spirit you get hold of him to
71:18
indwell you and let me tell you he
71:20
almost never stops talking to me he
71:22
talks again a lot most of the time you
71:24
hear him like out here speaking to you
71:27
um and sometimes he'll even say oh don't
71:29
turn there or don't go there or stop uh
71:32
that's usually saying him saying that to
71:34
you
71:35
even if it's in your spirit you hear him
71:38
but if you give him permission i want i
71:40
want to end with this you if you're born
71:42
again
71:43
and you're not spirit filled invite holy
71:45
spirit to indwell you you really must
71:47
it's the power of god in you it gets you
71:50
bold the power of god now lives in you
71:54
and you have access to that and you can
71:56
you need to say to the holy spirit i
71:58
give you permission to talk to me even
72:01
when i'm not paying attention
72:04
and if you say those words to him he'll
72:06
do it when when needed to protect you
72:09
when needed to encourage you he will and
72:12
and then you'll be the more you
72:14
recognize he is there
72:16
uh i talk to him like i do to jesus or
72:18
the father
72:19
um i've seen the outline of his being
72:21
he's very powerful looking too he's
72:23
outlined in fire he carries the fire of
72:26
god uh on him he is god
72:30
and uh they have the ability to step
72:31
inside of each other i've already been
72:33
in the throne and saw the father sitting
72:35
there jesus gets up and steps inside the
72:36
father the holy spirit comes
72:38
wherever there goes that steps inside
72:40
the father
72:42
and then the three in one
72:44
wow oh wow
72:45
a five-year-old could understand that a
72:48
five-year-old can understand the trinity
72:51
and yet man in their natural mind still
72:53
trying to figure out do they have three
72:54
heads how does this work
72:58
and then they step out and there they
72:59
are the three individual gods the
73:02
godhead
73:03
but one thing is for sure they love you
73:06
they care about you and they don't
73:08
like the darkness
73:12
that's good that's so good
73:14
cat wow that's so so good so so so good
73:16
all right well we got about a third of
73:18
the way through the questions because
73:20
i'm just enjoying it takes it longer
73:22
than i love it i love the time we spend
73:24
with each one but you know it's going to
73:26
take us another couple hundred shows
73:33
yeah he made me he picked me he made me
73:36
first of all
73:37
if you can imagine i'm so full of detail
73:40
that's why i have a photographic memory
73:42
so i never forget anything i saw heard
73:44
or experienced but i grew up like really
73:46
really
73:47
i was really i was high maintenance
73:50
because i knew things no one else knew
73:54
and the family i knew things that my
73:55
siblings were doing they didn't want me
73:57
to know um but i also knew what god was
74:01
saying and um so i was not normal even
74:03
when i was little i ate once a day i
74:05
slept four hours a day i was up all
74:07
night long
74:08
uh even young my mom would still always
74:11
been this way i thought that was new in
74:13
your life you've always been that way
74:15
huh but i'm a detailed person which is
74:17
good for god but when you're with
74:19
somebody trying to be over a project
74:21
or you're out picking something up from
74:23
the store
74:24
you're detailed then too
74:26
you know i'm sure that sharpens my
74:28
husband no i don't want that one it has
74:29
to have this slant has this this hue
74:32
this this tent this
74:34
is not over here i don't want that and
74:36
so i'm like that too so you get both of
74:39
me you get all of that i but but it
74:41
works well with heaven
74:43
that's why yeah well i mean you're a
74:44
revelator but you have a photographic
74:46
memory and you are a photographer
74:48
because to boot you i don't know
74:50
the verb forget details and while you're
74:53
not forgetting natural details you're
74:54
seeing supernatural all around you at
74:56
all times yes and i can't even i can't
74:59
even you know your brain must be
75:03
i mean
75:05
it's like living in two worlds
75:07
at the same time can't you are you um
75:10
here's let me use human
75:12
you know
75:13
terminology language
75:15
yeah while you're remembering in a in
75:17
your photographic memory now you're
75:20
seeing demons and angels and things as
75:21
you walk around the room and this cruise
75:23
ship or whatever are you recording and
75:25
not forgetting what those as well
75:28
do you remember what which entities were
75:30
doing what how how far does their memory
75:33
go well when i'm on the ship they try to
75:35
not be
75:36
there oh they do
75:39
well they already know me because they
75:41
know that i have this relationship with
75:43
jesus christ they know
75:44
uh they already know who i am i have
75:47
they they they have
75:49
blacklisted me
75:50
because they could get cast out
75:53
uh or i could say something that would
75:55
freak them out you know the spirit or
75:57
whatever uh and i won't tolerate when i
76:00
get up in the morning say i'm not
76:01
tolerating any of the darkness anywhere
76:02
near me i take power over all the power
76:04
of the enemy command the host of heaven
76:06
you will shred mesh bash and trash every
76:08
demon that even tries to come near me
76:10
shred platforms that have been built in
76:11
the spirit realm and some of those were
76:13
on cruise ships because for for whatever
76:16
reason
76:17
uh people got away with certain things
76:19
and then there's these spiritual
76:20
platforms they would be destroyed if i
76:22
was on that ship wow so so they don't
76:25
have maybe as much activity because i'm
76:28
in a captive place and there are
76:31
captives already if i am there
76:34
that's good well you know that's that's
76:36
a thing in scripture whereas it was paul
76:38
paul i know and such and such i know but
76:40
i didn't know don't know you so they do
76:43
know the high level
76:45
uh apostles prophets just holy people
76:48
men and women and children yes they do
76:51
is it such that when they get on this
76:53
cruise ship
76:55
they have a meeting and everyone knows
76:56
where the holy people are on the ship
76:58
how does it go
77:00
it's because of how much light you have
77:02
coming out of you okay
77:05
i mean they already know people who
77:07
don't have christ
77:09
uh it's not like they're not living
77:10
obviously their body's living but their
77:12
spirit man really doesn't have a lot of
77:14
life in it and sometimes they may follow
77:16
those people to see if they can get them
77:18
pulled into something but i take
77:20
authority over the whole ship
77:23
wow
77:24
wow
77:25
wow
77:26
yeah boy i would love to hear that you
77:28
know i'd love to go to heaven one day
77:29
and see what happened but i guess
77:31
the evil you don't see the evil replayed
77:34
that someone won i mean right
77:36
if you go to heaven you know the only
77:37
time you might see something like that
77:39
is if he allows you to see what your
77:41
prayers resulted in war without heaven
77:44
against the enemy i think he probably
77:46
it's not like it would really be there
77:48
it would be something that you would get
77:50
to see happen like in your life when
77:53
you're praying and you were praying for
77:54
somebody i think you do get to see the
77:57
destruction that your prayers called
77:59
calls again the enemy the spiritual
78:01
darkness i'd love to see that so i'd
78:03
like to see that now all right cat
78:05

78:06

80:38
going to say i will not tell you to go
80:39
give to some missionary camp those
80:41
people are trying to steal money from
80:42
you or they're saying that i said to
80:44
give to this group or for this cause
80:47
that's not me and i don't do it on
80:48
purpose because i don't want people
80:50
getting ripped off yeah so go to
80:52
category.com if you want to give and i
80:54
do want to end with this make sure you
80:56
are supporting elijah's an elijah
80:59
streams thank you like steve said they
81:03
they can't know every single person they
81:05
put on there but they do know if they
81:08
find out someone's not living right
81:10
that's what they're saying we're not
81:11
going to put them on there they're not
81:13
going to even promote them i wouldn't
81:14
either and sometimes people go through
81:17
stages of their life where they're not
81:18
hearing right or whatever reason
81:21
but i tell you god calls him a platform
81:24
for the prophets to speak for him
81:27
and if he cares about steve and he put
81:31
that in place then that is something
81:33
that is definitely valid to give to your
81:35
seating into the lives of millions of
81:38
people when you give to him and helping
81:40
to support his staff and future projects
81:43
like going to israel
81:46
if he ever does another tour of israel
81:47
make sure you get to go on that tour
81:49
it's amazing
81:50
and so many things we do
81:53
we speak for god we're not god but we
81:55
speak for him we allow him to speak
81:58
uh the best we possibly can because we
82:00
want you to know him want you to know
82:02
the truth the truth makes you free
82:05
not lies and deception so you have a
82:08
blessed day and yeah thank you kent i
82:10
think days definitely never stop
82:12
declaring declaration declaration is
82:15
still prayer declaring declaring and
82:17
decreeing over situations is still
82:19
prayer it's a really high level of
82:21

03:48
many people there are have not been

introduced to that and many people that
03:52
go there are not even saved but so
03:55
trying to figure out
03:57
from the lord which what are the best
03:59
things to say and show and tell
04:01
so that people can be initiated into the
04:03
prophetic so prayer is appreciated all
04:05
right let's bring kerr in here
04:08
hi
04:09
hi cat i guess for you it's good
04:11
afternoon it's about two to something
04:13
your time huh
04:15
yeah it's a little bit past morning for
04:17
me morning is noon
04:18
[Laughter]
04:20
yeah and it's about eleven
04:22
i guess we're yeah you're exactly three
04:24
hours ahead but well welcome to the
04:25
broadcast as you yeah as always uh
04:28
you're looking chipper as always so you
04:29
guys are still gonna are gonna move very
04:32
soon right to new offices or a new home
04:34
or what we're moving to a new home first
04:37
and after that uh margaret's already
04:39
been looking for office building we
04:41
can't start up with just something small
04:43
we we've gotten so huge inside where
04:45
we're at now
04:47
and so we're moving out first so we'll
04:49
be out all of our stuff will be out
04:51
because you know we've been
04:52
living here for 15 years actually where
04:55
we're at but the office took over about
04:58
six and a half years ago and then it
04:59
fastly it took over every room in in
05:02
this place so we call it the office not
05:04
even our home right now but we will be
05:06
moving
05:08
very shortly and then probably within a
05:10
few months after that we'll be moving
05:11
our offices yeah wow well you've really
05:14
been in a growth spurt so have we i mean
05:16
this year we
05:17
you and i saw a lot of growth didn't we
05:20
that was amazing and he would have grown
05:22
about the same time we did so we we just
05:24
kind of did it together didn't we
05:26
we did do it together it was god's plan
05:29
yeah it was it really really was we both
05:32
know it we both felt it we're both
05:34
experiencing it now so yeah well um go
05:37
ahead
05:38
go ahead people should understand i know
05:40
if you look around only at the world
05:43
what the world is seeing or even this
05:45
nation like i would say everyday people
05:48
uh a lot of people who are prophetic or
05:50
who just really prayer warriors
05:52
understand god's about to do something
05:54
powerful
05:55
and that's why the enemy is showing
05:57
himself off but as god says he's only
06:00
exposing himself people that's probably
06:02
as far as i'll go about that the enemy's
06:04
been exposing himself this whole last
06:06
year and a half and that makes them an
06:08
easy target
06:09
for god of course you know i'm talking
06:11
about god the god of heaven and earth
06:14
and he continued tells me
06:16
um that i have to be prepared for the
06:18
acceleration will be very quickly after
06:21
major things begin to happen
06:24
we want to keep this broadcast on here
06:26
so uh but you know i've been talking
06:28
about that all along people who've been
06:30
listening all along i'm so grateful for
06:32
your support for your prayers i know
06:34
steve is but god did actually plan this
06:36
together because it all started way back
06:38
you know back in 2019 this whole thing
06:41
kind of started what we're doing now
06:43
and um and god just knows what he's
06:45
doing that's what i can say i in my
06:48
spirit have so much celebration and
06:50
excitement in me i was with god last
06:53
night and my office right now is so
06:56
filled with him uh in here i i can't
06:59
help but have excitement on the inside
07:01
because that's that's how he feels and
07:03
so he says i have to have you into a
07:05
bigger place for you and your offices
07:08
have to be established uh so we're not
07:10
margaret i think we're thinking about
07:11
something smaller and god said no you're
07:13
gonna accelerate very quickly once you
07:15
leave here personally and when you leave
07:18
here in the offices it's it's about to
07:20
be very great these are great days for
07:23
people they're not the sad
07:26
fearful days
07:27
and you know speaking of how this all
07:29
happened to both of us this year i it's
07:31
very clear to me that
07:33
you know i call god one of his my names
07:35
for him is you know that's not like i
07:38
say dear manager but one of his
07:40
descriptions to me is he's a manager
07:41
i've asked him to manage my life and so
07:44
he literally withholds i mean he's
07:47
blessing the socks off of both of us but
07:49
he could do it he could even double it
07:51
right now but he knows you need that
07:52
often so he needs you to get into that
07:54
office into the home and until he just
07:56
goes
07:57
and it'll double triple quadruple you
07:59
know so yeah it will this is this is the
08:02
air this is the time and season and
08:04
years and breakthroughs where people are
08:07
need to hear the prophet's voice do you
08:09
sense that after the switch after the
08:12
right person is back in office
08:16
do you expect that people will need at
08:18
that point to have more prophetic words
08:20
or less prophetic words
08:22
i think they're going to begin to run
08:24
after the true prophetic
08:27
word of god that has been proven through
08:29
all of this that we've been going
08:30
through i already happen to know they
08:32
are literally going to run after people
08:34
to be near them to hear them it's going
08:36
to increase and not just that steve
08:39
salvations will begin to increase
08:42
greatly
08:43
not because it's the last day where
08:45
we're all out of here this is god
08:48
preparing for what's about to happen for
08:50
several generations of i know this also
08:53
that a lot of uh prophets are being born
08:56
right now as we speak uh in of course as
08:59
babies but they are prophets and god is
09:01
about to flood this world with the
09:04
prophetical and prophets so i hope
09:06
they're ready for that and i do know as
09:09
a parent who kind of raised one and
09:12
who's now a mentoring grandchildren who
09:14
are prophets wow they're not normal they
09:17
don't start out normal and they're going
09:19
to be very powerful let's say 10 20
09:22
years from now there'll be such powerful
09:24
voices in the earth we do need you steve
09:26
we do need the elijah's elijah streams
09:29
will be a known door opening for those
09:32
prophets who are really hearing god and
09:35
are living the life
09:36
it's going to happen we can't stop it
09:39
from happening
09:40
no one not anyone not spiritual or
09:42
physical in this realm or in the unseen
09:45
realm can stop from god from doing what
09:48
he's going to do you know and when god
09:51
god began to birth prophets even out in
09:53
the desert with moses to the extent that
09:56
a couple people started prophesying he
09:57
didn't have permission and they were
09:59
cattle on to moses and he goes what are
10:01
you jealous from my account he says what
10:03
that all god's people who are prophets
10:04
this whole desire and moses was himself
10:07
a prophet but he said with it all god's
10:09
people were prophets that was desire and
10:12
you know on on the amount of
10:13
transfigurations it was
10:16
moses the prophet he was also a little
10:18
law giver and he loved the prophet and
10:20
god you know what moses did on the earth
10:23
was important for him to say that was
10:25
super significant so
10:26
yeah well you know uh we're we're going
10:28
to jump into some questions about heaven
10:30
and related things anything else so make
10:32
sure we're giving you a chance to say
10:33
anything you were going to say before we
10:35
jump into those oh no that was it just
10:38
this acceleration that's going to happen
10:40
is why a lot of people i i'll just
10:43
repeat what god said
10:44
uh one day it will be hard to remember
10:48
these days we just went through except
10:50
the powerful part except the god part of
10:53
them uh we'll be doing so many powerful
10:55
things and you know it is god's heart
10:58
that all prophesy it says that that all
11:01
prophesied and my heart is everyone
11:04
knows the truth the truth comes from you
11:07
know jesus christ
11:08
he's the spirit of truth we know holy
11:10
spirit we know the father who all
11:12
revelation flows from it is there and
11:15
i'll just say there their heart that we
11:17
all know truth that we all hear him and
11:20
receive revelation because of the days
11:22
coming and all the flood of people
11:24
coming into the kingdom we'll have to
11:27
mentor them not
11:28
we not just me but the body of christ
11:30
will have to be at a level where they
11:32
can mentor these people uh coming on
11:34
board into the body of christ that's
11:36
good well
11:37
we're in it together this will be fun so
11:39
a lot of people if you're new and you've
11:41
not seen cat before cat over the last 20
11:43
some years maybe more a lot more than
11:46
that he has been to heaven and
11:48
thousands of times would that be about
11:49
accurate thousands of times that is very
11:52
accurate
11:53
so uh and i think one of my favorite
11:55
little clips from memory is he is a
11:58
visit to heaven might be you're in a
12:00
grocery store picking up a can of food
12:02
or something off the shelf by the time
12:04
you put your hand back down into the
12:06
basket you've been to heaven and back
12:08
and and they counter like
12:10
that might last how long and
12:13
how long would it seem a visit like that
12:16
lasted when you were there i think the
12:18
only way i can gauge that because they
12:20
don't have clocks in heaven anybody
12:22
there's no calendars or clocks in heaven
12:24
uh god does things according to events
12:28
actually his whole timeline that he has
12:30
behind his throne and embedded in the
12:31
floor of the throne is god's timeline
12:34
but it's done by events
12:36
that are planned down the earth it's not
12:38
like i know the hebrew calendar you can
12:40
tell me all about that that's still the
12:41
earth thing i'm talking about a heavenly
12:42
from a heavenly viewpoint god has events
12:46
already playing out he's already seen
12:47
him he's been there he already knows uh
12:49
what's gonna happen it's up to us to
12:51
choose to be a part of it but i only
12:53
know if i've been there uh a while is
12:56
how many places he shows me like if he
12:58
catches me up and he's talking to me
13:00
about a specific topic
13:02
or uh an event and then he shows it to
13:05
me he'll take me forward in time to show
13:07
me that event so i can talk very clearly
13:09
about the things that he's shown me and
13:11
then brings me back it probably wasn't
13:13
very long earth time um if i've taken to
13:16
three or four places which he can do and
13:19
with no time in heaven he can totally do
13:21
that but i realize while i've been there
13:24
for a while all those seconds in the
13:26
store have gone by i've been taking the
13:29
three four or even five places in heaven
13:31
that literally exists
13:33
and i could draw a map of those places i
13:35
literally could i've actually done that
13:36
a few times just for my
13:38
for myself i've actually drawn what's
13:40
around certain things in certain areas
13:42
of heaven
13:43
but one day we plan to have huge
13:45
displays
13:46
not just in our offices but we'll have
13:48
other places and um facilities where we
13:51
actually people can come and see things
13:53
happening as they when it looked like
13:55
when they happened in heaven what
13:56
happened literally looks like to walk
13:57
through it so it's a good thing i have
14:00
photographic memory yeah for sure for
14:02
sure by the way someone asked me a
14:04
question about your photographic memory
14:06
uh my my wife's
14:08
brother kind of has that and i'm sure
14:10
there's there's
14:11
there are degrees of photographic memory
14:14
does that mean that you never forget
14:17
anything or are there a certain type of
14:18
thing you always tend to remember it but
14:20
you can forget other things what does
14:22
that mean in your case
14:24
if it is regarding heaven i've never
14:26
forgotten any single time i've been
14:28
taken okay wow
14:31
wow wow
14:32
you could even identify that on that
14:34
particular trip you went down at the
14:36
different places i can i can't identify
14:38
it what it felt like what the aromas i
14:40
smelled uh the flavors i tasted uh what
14:44
the atmosphere was like what what what
14:46
it looked like what it felt like um what
14:49
other places what people were
14:51
experiencing there how they felt about
14:52
things how relationships happen how
14:54
transportation happens how heaven
14:56
operates
14:58
i could just go on and on because
15:00
he has shown me he sent me as a
15:02
revelator of heaven that's his title he
15:04
gave me and he takes me whenever he
15:07
wants to and i never say no
15:10
wow yeah i love that i love that
15:12
okay well let's jump into some questions
15:14
about heaven and these are some are
15:15
questions about heaven and others are
15:17
questions about things you understand
15:19
about the word because god's explained
15:22
it in heavenly language
15:24
okay we usually do a couple of kids once
15:26
this one there's a one by a child and
15:27
one by a young man so here's the my
15:30
grandson i don't know his age deborah
15:31
says my grandson wants to know
15:34
if dinosaur dinosaurs have feathers
15:37
and are there bright colors in heaven so
15:39
that's his son i don't have the
15:41
grandson's name
15:42
well i can start with the colors there's
15:44
colors in heaven that don't exist on the
15:46
earth
15:47
everything we have here is a shadow of
15:50
what is in heaven
15:52
and i always like every time i say that
15:53
the holy spirit makes me say this on
15:55
purpose that heaven is a world that's
15:57
round
15:58
like the earth is round
16:00
and he is adamant about saying it's not
16:02
flat and i know some people don't
16:03
understand that there's a whole group
16:05
out there the flat earth society
16:08
uh they think they can figure that out
16:10
and i went well they're not god and they
16:12
didn't make it and i happen to know that
16:14
it says that he sits above the circle of
16:16
the earth and i guess they think that's
16:17
a flat circle i don't know the holy
16:20
spirit always wants me to bring that up
16:22
because there's people who are in that
16:23
and really believe it and uh but i'm
16:26
telling you the earth is round it is a
16:28
world uh the father's house is a world
16:32
it's not just a building
16:34
and so whatever he makes or comes from
16:36
his being one of the things that comes
16:38
from his being is the rainbow and i tell
16:41
people if you want to see what it looks
16:42
like go watch the northern lights or
16:44
find it online the northern lights it's
16:46
not just a stagnant rainbow in other
16:49
words it doesn't just sit on him like
16:50
this it moves in and out in waves the
16:54
different uh layers of that rainbow and
16:56
anything it touches will turn that color
16:59
and so let me tell you everything you
17:01
would never expect trees can be teal
17:03
color uh they can be pink they could be
17:05
gold
17:07
creatures they're different colors so
17:09
yes there are vivid very beautiful
17:12
colors in heaven all over heaven there
17:15
are some dinosaurs that have wings and
17:17
some of them have feathers in them some
17:19
aren't some are made out of whatever
17:21
whatever substance he made them out of
17:23
but they're totally his dinosaurs he
17:25
made them i want to add again the holy
17:27
spirit says please tell them they didn't
17:28
come from hell there's this thing called
17:30
reptilian seed i don't know where that
17:32
came from i've never heard god say it he
17:34
made the dinosaurs he put him on the
17:36
earth the first time he made it
17:39
wow oh good good good okay now this is a
17:41
young man his name is elijah and people
17:43
have different questions that i wouldn't
17:45
have this question hopefully i'm going
17:46
to turn to it and the question is
17:49
do people blink in heaven now that
17:51
wouldn't be mine but he wants to know if
17:52
people blink
17:54
i'm pretty sure they do blink you still
17:56
have your eyelids in heaven your
17:58
spiritual body looks like you except
18:01
better better meaning if you were older
18:03
you're going to look young there's is
18:06
filled with the life of god you do kind
18:07
of glow a little bit uh people do kind
18:10
of glow in their spiritual body but you
18:12
can clearly see that's who that person
18:14
is you recognize him it says in heaven
18:16
you'll be known as you were known
18:17
there's a scripture and so it's not like
18:19
you become some little wispy thing
18:22
you're living in a spiritual world that
18:25
has substances it's almost like being
18:27
here but better
18:28
okay no darkness there of any kind but
18:31
you have a life you have a mansion you
18:32
live in the mansion you eat food you you
18:35
wear different clothing um so i forgot
18:39
what the question was
18:40
yeah
18:44
oh you will blink you will blink when
18:46
you see some of the things he's put up
18:48
there i mean a lot of people are like
18:49
they're like this
18:52
i mean you still have emotions you don't
18:55
have you know like fear you know or
18:57
anger or stuff like that but you have a
18:59
lot of you get excited and intensely
19:01
excited and undone and overwhelmed
19:04
because of the wonder and the splendor
19:06
which you're not going to ever find out
19:08
what that means to you go there so yes
19:10
people definitely blink
19:12
they blink they laugh i mean they laugh
19:14
a lot in heaven and they get overwhelmed
19:17
and undone by the goodness of god by the
19:19
waves of love that penetrate every bit
19:21
of heaven up there so it's just an
19:24
amazing place to live i will say this
19:27
again what jesus said tell everybody on
19:29
earth you have to make a living in order
19:31
to exist but in heaven you actually
19:34
exist to live to live you know my wife
19:37
and i said this all the time we said
19:39
that when we went to her parents
19:40
memorial they both passed away within a
19:42
week of each other in october
19:44
we both said since we know cat
19:48
and what we've learned about heaven our
19:49
entire
19:52
how to a demeanor at someone's death our
19:55
understanding is so much different
19:57
there's so much less grief there's so
19:59
much joy when our loved ones go go to be
20:02
with the lord because this is a
20:04
beautiful place yes their
20:06
body is here
20:07
they're reading means they're buried we
20:09
buried the dead we bury their remains
20:12
but they're not there they're with the
20:13
lord if they're if they're safe so it's
20:15
an entirely different thing and cat you
20:17
know i've never even thanked you as much
20:19
as i want to thank you for for changing
20:22
are
20:23
just giving us the truth you people
20:24
don't know you've actually paid a price
20:26
to do this so
20:27
we appreciate that we do appreciate that
20:29
very much all right now this is an
20:31
acquaintance of my
20:34
think i'd be better just read it because
20:35
it rather than try and tell it so here
20:37
it goes and this is from oh dear holly
20:41
he goes i had a question
20:43
for you or for cat i was wondering when
20:45
we pray over areas like for me it's
20:48
praying over ohio and indiana against
20:51
tornadoes do we need to be called
20:54
to a certain area or can we pray over
20:56
any area the reason i ask is because i
20:59
felt led to pray over my two states and
21:01
have since i was very young but i
21:02
remember and she names the name of a
21:04
teacher
21:05
a prophetic teacher he said i remember
21:07
years ago this teacher saying
21:09
you're asking for trouble my paraphrase
21:12
she said
21:13
if you pray over territories that you're
21:15
not called to pray over
21:18
which i did after kentucky got hit so
21:20
hard by tornadoes in december
21:22
they stopped at the ohio border i prayed
21:25
for iowa and minnesota when they were
21:27
expecting an outbreak of tornadoes and
21:30
immediately after that i got covered
21:33
so she's wondering did she do that to
21:35
herself because she prayed over a state
21:37
that she didn't have authority over
21:39
that had nothing to do with you
21:42
except you probably terrified the enemy
21:43
by doing it any believer
21:47
has the right to be over the weather i
21:49
will say this
21:51
the area you live in the state that you
21:54
live in you have a greater level of
21:56
authority but you really can take
21:58
authority and i do want to remind you
22:00
the holy spirit again is saying
22:01
something to me said remind them jesus
22:04
was in the storm when he stopped it
22:08
so you have greater authority wherever
22:10
you are present
22:12
so no matter what state you're in if
22:14
you're present when something comes up
22:15
you totally have the right to take
22:17
authority over that system that storm uh
22:20
there's nothing wrong with that jesus
22:22
was definitely over the weather no
22:23
matter where he went and when we were in
22:26
israel i spoke and dispelled the fog
22:28
that they said would be there for 25
22:29
minutes around the boat and i spoke and
22:31
within minutes it was gone i know i have
22:34
authority over it then me would like to
22:35
think you don't and people who've never
22:37
learned this
22:38
or even searched out what it said about
22:40
that you should understand that that
22:44
jesus is an example of what we can do
22:47
that's why he did these miracles it
22:48
wasn't just so he could be known
22:50
it was so that we also could step into
22:53
that place like him walking the
22:55
authority he gave us
22:57
if we have power over all the power of
22:59
the darkness and the enemy the enemy
23:01
causes severe weather that's not a
23:04
natural thing and i know the scientists
23:06
would say it was but what they're not
23:08
right they don't know understand the
23:10
spiritual side of things or the unseen
23:12
realm uh whatever you will take
23:14
authority over and of course you're not
23:16
giving yourself to the darkness i have
23:17
to add that you can't play an enemy's
23:19
camp and sin all the time and think you
23:22
have authority over anything
23:24
you you know there's a reason why jesus
23:26
said to walk a certain way
23:28
and if you walk in the spirit that means
23:30
you're aware of it of what's going on uh
23:32
you know you have authority in it and
23:34
you operate in that authority you can
23:37
you can make an effect on any severe
23:39
weather no matter what it is wherever
23:40
you are personally but other than that
23:43
where you live like floor is my greatest
23:45
level of authority although now he
23:47
actually says i speak worldwide about
23:49
things myself and and that that person i
23:52
think that said you were asking for
23:53
trouble that may have been he may have
23:55
been talking about the demonic hierarchy
23:58
like spirits of wickedness in high
24:00
places over certain areas he maybe they
24:02
meant that uh i know there's a thumb now
24:05
taking authorities over principles and
24:07
powers you better have holy spirit with
24:09
you and listen to the protocol you go
24:11
through to do that but i'm just talking
24:13
about right now about the weather any
24:15
weather system that would be destructive
24:17
you absolutely and you proved that by
24:19
what you did and we have way too many
24:22
testimonies that we we know
24:24
that we have the right to stop storms
24:26
shred storms or even shred them and
24:29
lower them and send them to places like
24:31
that need rain we've been doing that
24:33
this last year
24:35
well you know um that
24:37
that begs this question which you
24:39
actually just addressed is if someone
24:41
let's say it's not the weather and i'm
24:43
thinking of a friend of mine david he's
24:45
with the lord now but he told me years
24:47
and years this is like 30 years ago 30
24:49
40 years ago he was
24:51
in new york and he decided he was going
24:53
to take on the principality over new
24:54
york city and he was a seer he was a
24:57
singer so he saw it
24:59
and he came after this thing and he goes
25:00
i know you know he took a you know
25:02
within a couple minutes the car was
25:04
stopped he was arrested for some
25:06
trumped-up charge and put in jail he
25:08
said i'll never do that again so is that
25:10
what you're talking about he took
25:12
authority where he didn't have authority
25:13
and it was like
25:15
almost arrogant that he could do that
25:16
right if it is you know i was contacted
25:19
by very high level people
25:22
in the intercessory
25:23
arena and asked because you know six
25:27
times he has had me
25:29
through his protocol unseat
25:30
principalities i never once on my own
25:34
would even think to approach them you
25:36
know anything attacking me anything
25:38
coming against me or my family in the
25:40
demonic arena or in the arena i
25:42
absolutely have authority over that but
25:44
principalities and powers are very very
25:46
high level uh demons they don't live in
25:49
hell they sit on thrones over regions
25:51
where there's a lot of darkness and
25:53
there is a protocol to do it but you
25:55
better know what that is and god usually
25:57
will appoint me and tell me to go there
25:59
and what to do about it so i would not
26:02
and these people in high places on the
26:04
earth said how did you do that and not
26:06
die because they know people who died
26:08
they try to do so sometimes it's more
26:10
serious than just you think well i'm
26:12
over all of this and i can be uh you
26:14
know i can tear down the high things
26:16
and uh i wouldn't try to do that if you
26:19
don't have a lot of maturity in you
26:20
you're not hearing what god is saying
26:23
um i think you know depending on what he
26:26
did when he was in new york city he may
26:28
have been arrested just by if he's
26:29
getting out standing and yelling and
26:31
stuff like that as something out in the
26:32
public that may have been the reason why
26:35
that happened but i totally would not go
26:37
against something that god didn't tell
26:39
me to i'm not afraid of it i just am
26:41
wise
26:42
and so yeah people have died from doing
26:45
that and so i do have spirit realm boot
26:47
camp every year twice a year and uh if
26:50
you hear me doing that somewhere you
26:51
should come because then you understand
26:53
the operations of the spirit realm uh
26:55
different levels i don't run around
26:57
naming demons you know i don't just
26:58
don't do that i just take authority
27:00
where i don't where i want authority
27:02
but the special commission to go and do
27:04
something i have to follow exactly what
27:07
he's saying and it does happen but it's
27:10
not like i do that all the time so i
27:12
would definitely tell people don't step
27:14
out on your own power and your own
27:16
understanding of who you are think that
27:19
you can pull down those high places
27:21
there is a protocol but if you don't
27:24
know the protocol i would encourage to
27:25
do it but so that's what i did i
27:28
followed god's protocol
27:30
in 2000 my wife and i went to we were
27:32
offered to speak at a place in nigeria
27:36
and one of the evening
27:38
is there's 15 000 pastors and leaders
27:40
from africa at this place in
27:42
north area
27:44
and they decided to tell the whole
27:46
group that they were going to take on
27:48
and they started talking about the god
27:49
of the moon and blah blah blah and i
27:50
turned to our intercessor uh lisa she
27:53
was also see her i said is this okay for
27:55
us to do and she goes i wouldn't do this
27:57
at all so we just kept our mouth shut
28:00
let them do what they were gonna do i
28:02
didn't feel like they had authority
28:04
i don't think i and i didn't have the
28:05
authority it wasn't false humility it
28:07
was like
28:08
no there's no way i'm gonna
28:10
dance on this i got sick after that trip
28:12
as it was you know and i didn't
28:15
so anyway we got to be you got to
28:16
respect that
28:18
i think it's jude that says even even
28:20
michael the archangel didn't cast a
28:22
railing judgment against satan but said
28:24
the lord rebuked you so even there were
28:26
certain respect of the high level so all
28:29
right yeah so the weather
28:31
clearly
28:32
and i don't teach people how to get
28:33
protocols they don't ask me yeah that's
28:35
god wants you to go put on principality
28:37
he will tell you the protocol on how to
28:39
do that but as far as the there are
28:41
different levels in the darkness just
28:43
like those different levels and there's
28:45
different levels in business different
28:46
levels in the in the christian world uh
28:49
the medical field you wouldn't send
28:51
someone who's an intern to go do open
28:52
heart surgery would you and that's kind
28:55
of what you're doing if you think you
28:56
can go up without any authority remember
28:59
the seven sons of skiva let's just go
29:00
back to the bible and they saw you know
29:02
peter paul casting out demons they
29:04
thought they were going to go try it
29:06
they didn't have any authority
29:07
themselves that hadn't been walking in
29:09
that authority increasing that authority
29:11
and that demon tore them up so
29:13
there you go in the bible
29:16
you have to know what you're doing peter
29:17
and paul weren't attacked they weren't
29:19
assaulted they knew exactly what to do
29:20
and how to do it and they had walked
29:23
in that for some time in their life so
29:26
it's probably a good subject to bring up
29:28
because in these days of course there's
29:30
stuff everywhere you're seeing and
29:32
there's a big difference in trying to
29:33
take authority over a person doing
29:35
something wicked and in the spirit realm
29:37
maybe we'll do another whole session on
29:39
just that that would be important but
29:41
yeah um
29:42
people who are wicked in the natural
29:45
the reason they're like that is there
29:46
are demons around them affecting and
29:48
controlling them we can speak against
29:51
that part of it but i wouldn't uh
29:53
there's nowhere in the bible that i saw
29:55
where it said go attack people in the
29:56
natural
29:58
so even sending the host
30:01
even sending the host if you know
30:03
there's a person over here that's being
30:04
affected by demons and you say i'm
30:06
sending the host to take out the demons
30:08
that are causing him
30:10
that's one thing versus i come against
30:13
the principality that's that's
30:14
empowering those demons don't do that
30:16
right
30:18
well uh i think you can send the host
30:20
anywhere that you're impressed to send
30:22
them
30:23
and if they have authority from god to
30:25
do it then he'll allow them to do it and
30:29
if if he hasn't given them because even
30:31
they have different levels of authority
30:33
the army of heaven i'm talking about
30:35
because if you remember
30:38
you know even gabriel had to send for
30:39
michael for help going back to the
30:41
second thing you were talking about
30:43
he couldn't face these high-level demons
30:47
coming to bring that message to daniel
30:49
he couldn't do it himself he called for
30:50
michael when michael showed up let me
30:52
tell you i promise you they left okay
30:54
michael's not going to come in through
30:56
all your peers people just so you know
30:57
that
30:58
but anyway there are levels in every
31:01
type of army the natural army the
31:03
darkness the light and so um you need to
31:06
understand some of that stuff before you
31:08
try to go into that but sending the host
31:11
if you feel impressed to send them to
31:12
certain places if they have been given
31:14
the right by god to take down those
31:16
things they will
31:18
but the other things that they can do to
31:20
protect you to keep you
31:22
to pull down evil spirits in cities and
31:24
around areas if you have family there or
31:27
friends
31:29
or god has signed us on you to pray for
31:31
a certain area of things are going on
31:33
you definitely can send the army there
31:35
to pull down strongholds uh that's
31:37
different those are still the demonic it
31:39
says that our weapons they are minded to
31:42
the pulling down and strongholds that's
31:44
still the demonic that's still the dark
31:46
army but the the weapons one of those is
31:49
the army of heaven and so there are
31:51
certain things they automatically know
31:53
they can do and take care of um don't
31:55
let that stop you from starting to be
31:58
involved with the commanding the army of
32:00
heaven right now in this time they're
32:02
set but you have to know what you're
32:03
doing okay you still have to know what
32:05
you're doing and even what is the
32:07
purpose of your own heart are you doing
32:10
it yeah and i've heard you talk a lot
32:12
for the very first time i ever heard you
32:14
talk publicly you cautioned and exhorted
32:16
and warned
32:18
and taught people you better not have
32:20
sin in your life if you're doing some of
32:21
these things number one they're not
32:23
going to sit there and fold your hands i
32:24
think i recall you know you tell them
32:34
the word says that um
32:36
the army of heaven the host is the army
32:40
they're always called the host in the
32:42
bible the host hearken unto the word of
32:45
the lord why would they do that because
32:46
he's the lord of hosts jesus is over the
32:50
entire army of heaven no matter where
32:52
they're sent he is involved with that
32:54
they hearken under what he says so if
32:56
you're not talking
32:58
powerfully you're not talking in the
33:00
word in the word pray praying if you
33:03
don't have a strong relationship with
33:05
jesus christ hearing him clearly about
33:08
things some things like if you want to
33:10
send the army to go attack someone down
33:12
the street you don't like them you don't
33:13
like that they're loud noisy or crazy or
33:15
whatever
33:16
that army number one's never going to
33:18
attack humans
33:20
so that's why you have to speak as if
33:22
the lord would be saying it then they
33:24
will do what you're saying it is it is
33:27
also there's requirements to do have
33:29
authority and operate in it or we'd have
33:31
just chaos everywhere against everything
33:34
even heaven does have an order and
33:36
protocol is the best way to say that
33:38
their army operates by protocol like the
33:40
earth's army can't take orders from just
33:43
anybody you know the military can't they
33:45
have to take from those who have the
33:46
authority to give the orders and those
33:49
people have to operate even in the
33:50
military in a certain way to be able to
33:53
to head up our military uh some
33:56
private's not gonna run out there and
33:58
start yelling at the generals on people
33:59
to give orders in the in the natural
34:01
army well the same thing happens in the
34:04
spiritual army so you definitely need to
34:06
have a greater understanding of what you
34:08
think you're going to take down all of
34:10
hell
34:12
along the lines of the host you've
34:14
taught and shown pictures and all of
34:16
that about hosts that impress themselves
34:18
in cloud formation so that you can see
34:20
that they're there okay so
34:23
if someone's watching this today and
34:25
they've never heard that i just wanted
34:26
to say that part but this person says
34:28
every time i look into the sky i see or
34:31
seem to see a dragon in the clouds are
34:33
there hosts that look like dragons
34:37
yes there are they're called aragons
34:40
loki wow
34:41
and they they ride the host sometimes
34:45
we'll ride them let me get a drink i'm
34:46
talking a lot
34:51
um the hosts are transported to the
34:53
earth to do battle in many different
34:55
forms
34:56
one of the ways they love to do is they
34:59
ride the air guns the air guns are
35:00
actually part of the host they're not
35:03
just a ride they actually wore
35:05
themselves against some of the other
35:06
demonic part of the army but i actually
35:09
have a picture of some of them writing
35:11
i'm going to be posting some new
35:12
pictures or
35:14
maybe do a i don't know a host id
35:16
workshop somehow uh online and let
35:19
people know um but i actually have
35:22
pictures real pictures not doctored up
35:24
pictures you're talking to someone who's
35:26
clueless about
35:27
anything on the web or even doing stuff
35:29
or art i am a photographer old school
35:31
taking pictures you know with my film
35:33
camera and stuff like that
35:35
i can't i couldn't in any way nor do i
35:38
have time to learn how to fix things or
35:40
change things
35:41
uh the pictures i take are legit the
35:44
real god sends them i take the pictures
35:46
and he allows me to show them
35:48
but there are some called eragons and i
35:49
have a powerful one i think it was in
35:52
the calendar we did on the host
35:54
coming in and i was actually in the
35:56
store this big um
35:58
parking lot where there's like i don't
36:00
know on office max and michael's and
36:02
other things and it's a great big open
36:05
area so it's a good year to go and see
36:07
what's coming and usually they'll follow
36:08
me or come because i'm there
36:10
but i got the best picture ever of this
36:13
one aragon and you would call him a
36:15
dragon uh and dragons thing about
36:17
dragons that i do know is there is one
36:21
who's one of the gods in like these um
36:24
asian countries
36:26
and they have five toes i'm getting real
36:29
specific okay
36:30
uh none of heaven's aragon's and for
36:33
whatever reason they have four toes not
36:36
five
36:38
it is very interesting it was something
36:40
the holy spirit showed me and i went and
36:41
looked and i checked out and it's
36:43
absolutely true
36:44
some of these dragons that they show and
36:46
you know i do also want to go back to
36:48
the word that that god called satan the
36:51
old dragon
36:53
and there's a reason why he called him
36:55
an old dragon an old dragon would be
36:57
toothless they'd have no fire left in
37:00
them they'd have no power left in them
37:02
at all if you think about why he called
37:04
him that
37:05
god has a behemoth which is an aragon he
37:08
has one himself
37:09
and uh but they're not bad in any way
37:12
are they bad uh so that's just uh not
37:15
that you should bring well i will go
37:17
into another time but you shouldn't
37:18
bring certain things in and just hang
37:20
pictures of stuff on your walls i
37:22
definitely wouldn't hang anything that
37:23
was a
37:24
attached to witchcraft in any way you
37:27
don't want to bring that into your home
37:29
just don't do it
37:31
derek prince found that out himself and
37:33
one of his stories he told but but the
37:36
five-toed dragon is worshiped in other
37:38
asian countries as a god uh but all of
37:42
the aragons that fight in heaven or come
37:44
from heaven have four toads and their
37:48
whole purpose is to work with the army
37:50
of heaven so yes there are some you
37:52
actually can write on them in heaven
37:54
when you when you go there but they're
37:56
called eragons that's true wow that's
37:58
good and someone else i don't remember
38:00
if i ask you this but a different
38:02
question at a different time wanted to
38:04
know if satan or if the enemies of our
38:07
soul
38:08
can he press things into the cloud too
38:10
would someone look at that and say well
38:11
that looks like demonic
38:13
or or does he have not not the power to
38:15
do anything with that what would you say
38:17
oh no they you know i i would just tell
38:20
people the spirit realm all around us
38:23
is unseen there's more of the spirit
38:25
round than the physical realm you need
38:26
to understand that the physical realm
38:29
was stretched out like a curtain before
38:32
god even put these physical uh planets
38:34
and stars before he put them there he
38:36
actually had to make a physical realm
38:39
it talks about in the bible where he
38:41
says uh you know he stretched it out
38:43
like a curtain that's actually what he
38:45
did before he made the earth and
38:47
everything uh he spoke the word and the
38:50
word actually stretched the curtain out
38:53
and that's why it says at the very end
38:56
of the bible he will fold this all up
38:58
like an old garment which i think is
39:00
pretty cool yeah so further on in the
39:03
early in the bible it says you stretch
39:04
the stars and plants out like a curtain
39:06
and but at the very end it says he will
39:08
fold it all away like a garment hey
39:10
there's that curtain he's folding it
39:11
away and going to make all things new so
39:14
that's just to let you understand in
39:16
order to have this physical plan and you
39:18
live here in the physical body you had
39:20
to make a physical realm the spirit
39:22
realm always existed it's a real realm
39:25
everything in it has substance it's all
39:27
spiritual it's all spiritually
39:29
um
39:31
living but that's why in your spiritual
39:34
body you literally live a real life in
39:36
heaven if you base down here you have
39:38
the best bakery in heaven uh if you run
39:41
rodeos you have rodeos in heaven but the
39:43
the bulls and the horses are talking to
39:44
you the whole time you're trying to ride
39:45
them and you're not ever going to win
39:47
probably up there
39:49
but but there's a difference your spirit
39:51
is unseen right now but in heaven is
39:53
seen everywhere this what you've
39:56
to clarify that can a spirit can an evil
39:58
spirit do something with the clouds that
40:00
someone would identify yes okay and i do
40:03
have i this is kind of tight
40:06
i do have some pictures of them in the
40:08
clouds i'm not showing this yet because
40:10
yeah but they are and sometimes like
40:13
like in you might think if they haven't
40:15
been photoshopped in some severe weather
40:18
you might actually see some faces off
40:21
the darkness okay and some of those in
40:23
those situations
40:25
but there are more of the hosts on the
40:28
earth than there are the demonic but yes
40:30
they can also but they don't do a good
40:32
job of it i'm just going to say there's
40:34
a big difference in how they try to make
40:36
a shape because some of the hosts can
40:38
get together and make some kind of
40:39
really fantastic shape in the clouds
40:42
um but the demonic when they try to do
40:44
it they don't want to they don't work
40:46
together they just don't work together
40:48
they don't like each other they don't
40:50
i'm talking about the dark army the
40:51
eamon the demons
40:53
they don't like each other they don't
40:54
care about each other they don't want to
40:56
work together at all and so what they
40:58
try to do together usually doesn't turn
41:01
out really good
41:03
and i want to clarify that one thing
41:05
that you said because i'll make sure
41:06
people know what you're referring to
41:08
maybe you need to give an example but
41:10
you said derek prince learned the hard
41:11
way put something on his wall what are
41:13
you referring to that someone put on a
41:14
wall that someone should be because we
41:16
were talking about clouds and all of a
41:18
sudden you were saying this i want to be
41:19
sure people know what you're referring
41:21
to about don't put them yeah back when
41:22
we were talking about the dragon thing
41:24
okay
41:25
yeah he and this is a story he told
41:28
himself of course we all know he's in
41:29
heaven right now uh he did get them i
41:31
think he inherited them from his
41:33
grandfather or something when he he
41:36
served i think in one of the wars in an
41:38
asian country and brought back pictures
41:40
of these um
41:41
i think they were the five-toed dragons
41:43
okay okay that's what he put on the wall
41:46
yeah and he didn't he was clueless and
41:48
you know derek prince was one of the
41:49
first ones to talk about piercing the
41:51
darkness he actually he began to uh to
41:53
look at that listen to god and god
41:55
taught him a lot about the darkness and
41:57
the spirit realm and the darkness and
41:59
yet it changed everything when he put
42:00
him on his walls he didn't say to god
42:03
are these are these acceptable he just
42:05
put him on his walls even
42:08
i think his wife got real sick his
42:09
friends began to hate him his business
42:11
was falling apart and finally and every
42:14
time he walked by him he would admire
42:16
them i just tell you what he said
42:17
himself he would admire them aren't they
42:19
beautiful oh i love them you know i mean
42:21
he was actually
42:23
and finally he went to god and said why
42:25
is my wife so sick why have my friends
42:28
all left me and god said you have a
42:30
defilement and you've put on your walls
42:31
you need to take them off
42:35
he said what he said the dragons
42:39
you know mine
42:40
walked he cleansed his house he cleansed
42:42
it and immediately listen his wife was
42:46
healed
42:48
back his his business and his money
42:50
exploded
42:52
because he had obeyed god and after that
42:54
he that's when he began to teach people
42:57
be careful what you bring into your home
42:59
if it's statues of other gods they
43:01
wouldn't bring it you know what god said
43:03
about that himself you know he said to
43:05
break them up and not even have nothing
43:06
to do with them it isn't this is a thing
43:08
it isn't like
43:10
a statue of so-and-so
43:12
you know not real god
43:14
that thing itself wouldn't hurt you but
43:16
the spirit attached to it
43:19
and all these um
43:20
things that are going on out there no
43:22
matter what demonic
43:24
influence it is it's not i'm not going
43:26
to name certain religions right now
43:28
because people will be focusing on them
43:30
and some people are very nice and some
43:32
of them not everybody is against people
43:34
a lot of these people in false religions
43:37
are actually kind they don't understand
43:38
why people hate each other but the point
43:40
is this your life is run by the devil
43:42
the devil is over every antichrist
43:45
spirit and the antichrist spirit means
43:47
they're against jesus
43:49
as god and so he introduces all these
43:52
false gods some countries have hundreds
43:54
of them and they they worship them they
43:56
bring food to them they make temples for
43:58
them and that is not helping their life
44:01
in any way whatsoever because they have
44:03
no power to save no power to heal
44:06
and that's god's point you want to bring
44:08
something in and here you are honoring
44:10
something that is an image that is
44:13
worshipped as a false god you know
44:16
not to keep them in your house my
44:18
grandparents were missionaries in china
44:20
my father was born in china i remember
44:23
used to see this massive ornate wooden
44:26
carved hand-carved chest and it was out
44:29
in the living room when we go to our
44:30
grandparents now they were devout
44:31
christian people
44:33
but a whole lot of evil got into my
44:35
family and now
44:36
years later i'm kind of they're all
44:38
going to be with the lord but
44:39
there was a lot of evil stuff that
44:41
entered in as you know i've adjusted to
44:43
with my about my father it makes me
44:45
wonder did them sitting here displaying
44:47
these ornate things with these
44:49
tibetan
44:51
gods or these idols and these things and
44:54
i would go to their house and they're
44:55
all these chinese
44:58
things hanging on the wall some of them
45:00
were probably
45:01
fine but others were these little ornate
45:03
gods and then one of and my
45:05
grandfather's brother gave us that gift
45:07
and i mentioned it before these ivory
45:08
little gods
45:10
from india because they're all the
45:11
missionaries went over there and got all
45:12
these goods so they could show people
45:14
isn't this beautiful it's crazy well we
45:17
could could talk ourselves into thinking
45:19
that's just pretty and that's nice
45:22
some of them you're right some of them
45:23
are harmless some of them are beautiful
45:26
uh people and some of these foreign
45:28
countries have such amazing gifts to
45:30
create
45:32
they don't know god for who he is
45:34
i'm sure if they did they would be
45:36
putting images and some who got born
45:38
again i do know have have done the same
45:41
type of thing but they put the image of
45:43
christ they put the angelic or whatever
45:45
of that on there but the thing is if you
45:47
don't have discernment if you're not a
45:50
seer and you can't see what's around it
45:52
i'd be very careful
45:54
about what you pick up i'm not saying i
45:56
don't like people thinking you have to
45:58
look at every single inch in your place
46:00
or every single thing you have but i
46:02
would say if you know it to be something
46:04
that you know is not a true god
46:07
why have that there instead of something
46:09
that represents heaven or god which is
46:10
one of the reasons by the way by god is
46:13
about to flood the marketplace with all
46:15
kinds of things that represent heaven
46:17
that represent them so people have a
46:19
choice because i understand right now in
46:21
our marketplace especially the one right
46:22
now there's not a whole lot of choice to
46:24
bring light or life or hope even hope
46:27
into people's lives but it does matter
46:30
what what you do portray it matters the
46:33
images you wear it matters the images
46:35
you have put on your skin
46:37
uh i'm just saying god marks people
46:40
himself sometimes but what image are you
46:42
betraying is it's for the kingdom of
46:44
darkness or not sometimes people need to
46:46
break off any connection with what
46:49
they've had put tattooed on them and say
46:51
i break any sever any connection with
46:52
that i know people who were affected by
46:55
that so
46:57
image people used to say image is
46:59
nothing but actually according to god
47:00
image is everything
47:01
it is everything okay well what you
47:03
represent or what you believe sometimes
47:05
or people will think that so we went a
47:08
long way on that whole thing yeah that
47:09
was good that'll give people some tools
47:11
to deal with now this is a i was talking
47:13
to my staff
47:14
beforehand this is a fascinating
47:16
question i would have not thought this
47:18
question would ever be asked but listen
47:21
i think it's really interesting she goes
47:22
i love to knit and crochet she was
47:25
excuse what is it going to be like in
47:27
heaven for a knitter or a crocheter i
47:30
believe that i will have a mansion for
47:32
my knitting
47:34
interesting what are your thoughts i
47:36
agree if that is a gift that she has and
47:38
she loves it and she's really excellent
47:40
at it i think she probably will have a
47:42
studio what what he does he gives
47:44
everybody gets a mansion but part of
47:46
that property or even part of that
47:49
mansion definitely would be you know i
47:52
know you've heard me say people have
47:53
restaurants in heaven they have studios
47:56
they have galleries
47:58
a lot probably number one what she would
48:00
be knitting would be alive the threads
48:02
she would knit together could make
48:04
different tunes and become a symphony
48:06
when she's done with what she makes
48:08
it could also portray something that
48:09
would represent images of things that
48:12
are already in heaven but i do know
48:14
paintings when you paint in heaven they
48:16
come alive i mean they're on your wall
48:18
but you can see movement you can see
48:19
life in them i am quite sure that what
48:22
she would make or knit would have a life
48:24
in itself
48:26
wow very very cool
48:28
um okay this is an interesting uh
48:30
question a viewer asked one of the nine
48:32
gifts of the spirit would the seer gift
48:35
fall under
48:39
i don't know if it has to fall under one
48:40
of those yeah i kind of thought you'd
48:43
say that but i didn't
48:44
god gives that gift god and only god and
48:48
people go well you know there's mediums
48:50
out there and other people who can see
48:53
those people were given a gift by god
48:55
but because the other person got
48:56
overtaken or used by
49:00
the darkness then that gift could be
49:02
used for that purpose
49:04
god makes seers and sinceres it's
49:06
important and you can see why all the
49:07
stuff that everyone has benefited from
49:09
that god has shown me or that i see and
49:11
understand it's important to have seers
49:14
but that gift is only given by the
49:17
father and he puts it in you before he
49:19
sends you
49:21
it's in you and there are different
49:23
levels of seeing sometimes you'll see
49:24
something every now and then sometimes
49:26
you'll see parts of things or not
49:28
sometimes you'll see the darkness
49:29
sometimes the
49:30
the uh or heaven stuff i see everything
49:33
all the time like the whole entire uh
49:36
unseen world that's why you're called a
49:38
seer a seer sees the unseen world
49:42
and um you see transportation you see
49:44
beings going back and forth you see how
49:46
they operate
49:47
which has always been powerful for me
49:49
growing up i was powerful
49:52
not powerful like i came against things
49:54
not that kind of power but the powerful
49:56
knowing who i am and i know the truth
49:59
already because i've seen the truth you
50:01
can't hide the truth from a seer
50:04
so being used on the other side in the
50:07
camp of the enemy and people think i'm
50:09
doing this beautiful stuff for him but
50:11
they they connect with spirit guides and
50:14
stuff like that god doesn't have spirit
50:15
guides people
50:17
he has the angelic and mess mattresses
50:19
for him he has holy spirit so even that
50:22
is
50:23
such a small
50:24
area in the life of almost most
50:26
christians don't know
50:28
um they think when you say the word
50:30
spirit you're being filled with the holy
50:31
spirit which are
50:33
very major to be filled with the holy
50:34
spirit or the holy spirit himself i'm
50:36
talking about the unseen realm when i
50:38
say the spirit and the seer sees it
50:42
you see it clearly some see maybe not so
50:46
clearly but someone who's been doing a
50:48
long time and understood that and then
50:49
trained by god
50:51
what to do with that stuff it's very
50:53
powerful
50:54
i don't think a seer has to come under
50:56
those any of those yeah
50:58
yeah there's i think there's a
51:00
fault the false isn't the right word
51:01
there's an incorrect
51:03
understanding that any gift must fall in
51:05
those nine that gives
51:07
thousands of gifts right yeah and things
51:09
that people can do in variations of the
51:11
things so
51:12
yeah because
51:15
people are sent as a gift themself you
51:17
know what they can do what he has given
51:20
them to do or make or
51:23
use for god's purposes
51:25
we are we are sent every good and
51:27
perfect gift comes down from the father
51:30
of lights those lights are you when you
51:32
lived in him and before he sends you to
51:35
this earth he puts a gift in you and
51:37
having you use that gift all over having
51:40
to do things so
51:41
those are uh i think you're talking
51:43
about
51:44
spiritual gifts i think there's nine
51:46
gifts in the spirit spiritual gifts
51:49
but we all in the natural age have a
51:51
gift also but those nine gifts of the
51:54
spirit are different than god making you
51:56
a certain way and this is what he made
51:59
you he made me a seer it's not i saw
52:02
before i mean you know i got saved four
52:05
years old but i still saw in the spirit
52:07
before that i was a seer because he sent
52:10
me that way so i was two and three i'd
52:12
see angels everywhere but at four i gave
52:14
myself to christ i saw him step inside
52:16
of me
52:17
and i knew he was in there and people
52:19
couldn't couldn't get me away from him
52:21
because i saw him step in me so
52:24
well you know the paul talks about
52:26
that's not one of the nine groups of
52:27
spirit that's just something god makes
52:29
you as a senior
52:31
paul talks about uh you know he prays
52:33
that god will give you a spirit of
52:34
wisdom and revelation that you may know
52:35
him better but this
52:37
when whoever gets the spirit of
52:38
revelation
52:39
there's about a zillion ways you can
52:41
revelate or receive you might have a
52:44
vision you might have dreams you might
52:45
suddenly know and you don't know why you
52:47
know right so two ten people with the
52:49
spirit of revelation
52:51
they may not look alike at all as far as
52:53
how they get it
52:54
that's right
52:57
right
52:58
yeah revelation is
53:00
revelation is god speaking all
53:03
revelation comes from the father it does
53:07
uh of course his son was filled with
53:10
revelation but revelation is the mind
53:12
and heart of god himself of the father
53:15
and when he shares it so you openly
53:17
understand the scriptures you understand
53:20
his plans his will his way uh that's
53:23
what revelation is so powerful
53:26
it's not head knowledge it's usually
53:28
something you didn't think of but it's
53:30
so great
53:31
and it's usually simple it it gives you
53:34
something greater um
53:36
to understand the word of god like i
53:38
said but revelation comes from god most
53:41
of the stuff i'm talking about there's
53:42
no way in my mind i could have thought
53:45
about it or even tried to figure it out
53:47
so revelation definitely comes from god
53:50
and there's many people who get
53:51
revelation yeah hey you know that that
53:54
causes a question that wasn't on my list
53:56
because it happened to me this morning i
53:57
woke up in the middle of the night in
53:59
the middle of the night there's a praise
54:01
song it's like i'm praising but it's an
54:03
old
54:04
old praise song i wouldn't have thought
54:06
about i wouldn't have known and all of a
54:09
sudden the words the music i'm hearing
54:10
it in my mind
54:12
and then this then i went back to sleep
54:14
because i started to praise him and i
54:15
fell back to sleep i wake up a totally
54:17
different praise song is going through
54:19
my mind also when i hadn't thought of
54:21
for months and months so what is that is
54:24
that god asking telling my
54:26
is that god causing praise to rise
54:28
through my spirit while i'm asleep or is
54:31
that god telling me i need to be
54:32
praising how would you discern that i
54:35
think that's
54:36
him filling your spirit with it while
54:38
you're sleeping
54:40
uh people who really seek god even while
54:42
you're sleeping he can impart things
54:44
into you
54:45
and if you happen to wake up in the
54:47
middle of some of that something like
54:49
what you just explained
54:51
some people would get up and just start
54:53
worshiping it's always it's always
54:55
important to worship you know i
54:58
i worship in many different ways with
55:00
god i don't have a voice that i could go
55:02
sing on a platform people would probably
55:03
laugh at me and i wouldn't do that to
55:05
you anyway but on my own of course i do
55:08
jen's laughing behind them
55:11
right now
55:14
just as a funny note just to be funny
55:16
when i was first speaking and i didn't
55:18
really have a clue you know how to do it
55:20
and do any of that the revelation was in
55:23
me but i didn't really know so we went
55:24
to somebody's we used to do a lot of
55:26
home meetings don't ask me to do
55:30
you couldn't get the people in your home
55:31
they'd be all over your yard but they
55:33
were hooking me up for a mic and it was
55:35
right before worship was supposed to
55:36
start
55:37
and jen looks at them and she goes she's
55:39
not leading worship right
55:42
now
55:43
yeah i'm not leading worship right now
55:45
no no no we wouldn't do that
55:53
so we're both like warning them no we
55:55
don't know no she doesn't do that you
55:57
couldn't you could have just made a
55:58
joyful sound you know but some people's
56:00
joyful sound is better than other
56:02
people's joyful sounds but sometimes
56:04
sometimes steve when you wake up first
56:06
thing i will just say this and this is
56:08
truth when you first wake up those first
56:11
few minutes are so key to you probably
56:13
hearing god very clearly i would wake up
56:16
and say do you have something to say to
56:18
me and i'd be talking to god this is
56:20
something you want to say to me
56:22
many times i wake up and the minute my
56:23
eyes open he starts speaking to me and i
56:26
have found it's true when you're between
56:28
that window of the natural
56:31
realm and the spiritual realm
56:34
sometimes he can actually show and tell
56:36
you things if you would wait a few
56:38
minutes and ask him he probably wouldn't
56:41
start to get
56:43
have like visions or have encounters so
56:46
i've never really told people that but
56:48
when i first wake up which is my few
56:51
hours
56:52
he's already even starting to speak to
56:54
me that's when he walks through the wall
56:56
of my home sometimes he'll just start
56:58
sharing things with me i haven't
57:00
connected fully with this natural in
57:03
other words i haven't left my room i
57:04
haven't gone out into civilization yet
57:07
it's really one of the best times to
57:10
begin to listen and see if he's saying
57:12
something and you're so open already
57:14
that when you when you wake steve you're
57:16
already hearing what's going on around
57:18
you that could even be some activity of
57:21
heaven around you happening and that's
57:23
why you're hearing
57:24
some of that music so it could also mean
57:26
that that's really good good good
57:28
teaching good to know because you know
57:30
all i could think of is god must want me
57:32
to worship and so i began but next thing
57:35
i know i'm about i'm asleep again but if
57:37
if i were more intentional and say don't
57:40
let yourself go to sleep
57:42
praise him on purpose and don't go to
57:43
sleep that probably would have been a
57:45
good deal or you could just say steve
57:48
do you want to share something with me
57:50
right in the middle of it say father is
57:52
that you wanting to share something with
57:54
me you might be surprised
57:56
that's good okay that's good good i'll
57:59
do that so
58:00
let me just see i'm cutting notes here
58:02
make sure all right
58:03
let's see
58:05
here's the interesting almost funny
58:06
question is there gravity in heaven
58:11
oh well um there is a form of type of
58:14
gravity i don't think they don't call it
58:15
gravity if you if you jump and you want
58:18
to go down your purposes go down you're
58:19
going to go down okay
58:21
uh you in people i have learned by this
58:24
time that a lot of people do fly all
58:25
over heaven you just can you know when i
58:27
first started going in the beginning
58:29
there's been so much more he's shown me
58:31
i'm so busy sharing what he showed me in
58:33
the beginning and things that people
58:35
really should know about i don't always
58:37
get to add stuff but many people most
58:40
people whenever they when they've been
58:42
there for a while they realize they can
58:44
just like fly around heaven and stuff
58:46
like that if you want to leap on high
58:48
things you also can do that there's
58:50
buildings floating in the air i know
58:51
i've said that you just leap from where
58:53
you're at and you leap maybe 20 30 feet
58:55
above the
58:58
streets or wherever and you can actually
58:59
go into the building that way and when
59:01
you come out you just jump it's not like
59:03
you're going to fault the speed of light
59:04
and smash yourself
59:06
but you will go down that's your purpose
59:08
to go down and you'll go down so it it's
59:10
it's a different life completely well
59:12
yeah you know when i picture heaven i'm
59:15
thinking this beautiful scene this
59:16
building this something but
59:20
in when you're in heaven are you seeing
59:21
activity in the air all the time are you
59:24
seeing it all the time
59:27
oh yeah you're seeing stuff going on all
59:29
the time in the in the i call it the um
59:33
i call it the celestial round would be
59:35
all the sky of heaven the celestial
59:36
realm wrapped around the world god
59:38
heaven
59:39
there's almost as much activity up there
59:41
there's buildings there's streets to go
59:43
on in in the sky there's shops to go
59:46
into oh there's all kinds of things to
59:48
do you can imagine you're not bound just
59:50
to be walking on the ground
59:53
uh you travel on light you travel on
59:55
sound you travel on music it's just
59:57
almost inconceivable try to take i can't
60:00
wait till we start making movies we are
60:02
going to make movies god's already
60:03
informed me of that and you will
60:05
actually see life in heaven lived in in
60:08
movies but they haven't liked this one
60:11
he said they exist to live they didn't
60:13
live until they got that
60:15
yeah
60:16
anything i'm not going to argue with
60:18
people i have to always say that you'll
60:20
know your body sleeps in the ground your
60:21
body does but you aren't your body your
60:24
body's wrapped around your spirit man
60:27
you were always a spiritual little being
60:29
a little one and then when you came to
60:31
earth and he gave you this body this
60:33
body adapted to the appearance kind of
60:35
of your spirit man you become like one
60:38
then of course when you die your spirit
60:40
goes to heaven your soul is in your
60:42
spirit your soul is not sleeping okay
60:46
that's not right your soul is never
60:47
going to sleep it never sleeps your
60:48
soul's awake even while you're sleeping
60:50
now that's why you should play awesome
60:52
music and feed your spirit or somebody
60:55
words of god speaking or something
60:57
or i'm just tell people feed your spirit
60:59
at night by listening to something
61:00
that's powerful or beautiful that would
61:03
that would um
61:04
open up you know more of your spirit to
61:07
hear but but no there's so much activity
61:10
in the sky of heaven i think half of
61:12
half of heaven is in the sky the other
61:14
half the beautiful ground of heaven so
61:18
yeah well yeah the stuff in the sky like
61:20
that it makes me think of movies where
61:22
they make
61:23
everything in the air but i know i don't
61:24
normally think of it that way but okay
61:26
this one caleb wants to know has cat
61:29
ever seen michelangelo
61:31
or any other famous painters and artists
61:34
like van gogh and chris you've seen a
61:36
lot of people but there's thousands you
61:38
haven't seen it's not like you've seen
61:39
them all
61:40
have you seen any famous artists like
61:42
that or old time
61:44
they there are there are of course
61:46
there's famous artists who went there
61:48
many of them knew god and were close to
61:50
god themselves
61:51
i can't at this moment i've seen work
61:54
done by some of them but but i can't say
61:56
i literally saw that person and you're
61:58
right there's actually millions of
62:00
people in heaven right now people
62:03
picture heaven with a handful of people
62:05
in health full of the masses but there's
62:07
there's a lot of people that live in
62:09
heaven and heaven is so huge it's bigger
62:12
than our own galaxy the world called
62:14
heaven is bigger than a galaxy
62:16
there's no way okay you've been bent but
62:18
the few places but significant places
62:21
like the throne room and other places
62:23
that are in heaven god wants people to
62:25
know
62:26
uh it's this earth is a shadow it's just
62:29
a shadow of what's there the beauty
62:31
splendor wonder the activity that your
62:33
loved ones are getting to do some of
62:35
them actually ask things to be prepared
62:37
to bless you when you get there there
62:39
are places you know he says i might we
62:42
go to prepare i go to prepare a place
62:44
for you
62:45
that place is not just one mansion i
62:49
will tell you that again on the ground
62:51
or property which could be miles if you
62:54
want miles around your property
62:57
and have beautiful things on that
62:58
property that you love to do or enjoy
63:00
doing there's doors all over the
63:03
property just floating about a foot
63:04
above the ground when you walk in that
63:07
door on your property it takes you to
63:09
another part of your place it could be
63:10
somewhere else in heaven wow wow so your
63:13
place can be
63:15
okay so i've always
63:17
thought well i'd like to have a place in
63:18
the mountain
63:19
in heaven a place on the valley and a
63:22
place
63:23
by the sea whatever because that's what
63:25
i would like here
63:26
but you're saying you don't go out
63:29
through that doorway that portal to go
63:31
to another place
63:33
it's all your place is that what you're
63:35
saying yes you're right it's all in your
63:37
place
63:38
it's in another part of heaven it would
63:40
be in another area of heaven but when
63:42
you go through that door what you're
63:44
seeing is yours
63:46
that's good yeah yeah
63:50
okay uh here's a woman joanie who says
63:53
cat i've been praying for the gift of
63:55
tongues and it hasn't happened yet what
63:57
can i do
63:59
what can you tell her
64:00
i would say you know of course when
64:04
when i was 18 um when i got filled with
64:06
the holy spirit of course by that time i
64:09
had seen i was raised up in um
64:13
a godly home not perfect home been in a
64:15
godly home where god was so real to me i
64:19
mean he was very real
64:21
activity activities of heaven they were
64:23
real
64:24
i knew about hell i mean my dad
64:26
explained all the stuff says he was very
64:28
very close to the father to jesus
64:31
and so it's his mother so we have
64:33
generations of
64:35
being connected to heaven even while
64:37
living on the urn
64:39
and so i i can just to tell people that
64:42
um i already forgot the question
64:45
about about how to get how to speak in
64:47
tongues she hasn't been able to speak in
64:49
tongues
64:50
yeah the holy spirit's greatest delight
64:53
is to indwell you
64:54
i can tell you that he waits with
64:56
anticipation once you're born again to
64:59
invite him i i would just say i actually
65:02
just invited him to indwell me and said
65:04
i invite you to indwell me holy spirit i
65:06
want to know you uh i want to i want to
65:09
feel your presence around me and and to
65:13
you know i don't think i spoke in
65:14
tongues at that very moment i think it
65:16
was probably later on in the day i was
65:18
just thinking about god thinking about
65:20
that i invited the holy spirit
65:22
and opened my mouth and out came just
65:24
two syllables
65:25
and and that was beside myself excited i
65:28
just kept saying those two syllables and
65:30
pretty soon more read and more were
65:31
added sometimes it happens different
65:34
ways some people are instantly filled
65:36
with the holy spirit and your that's
65:38
they call that also your they can call
65:40
that your prayer language it's another
65:42
word for speaking in tongues that the
65:44
devil is terrified of he doesn't want
65:46
anyone to have that power it's power it
65:49
gives you power
65:50
it gives you confidence in who you are
65:53
the holy spirit will help lead you guide
65:55
you he'll never leave you but there's a
65:57
difference and when you're born again he
65:59
comes alongside and it says that in the
66:01
bible when you're born again the holy
66:02
spirit is alongside you and he will help
66:05
you but when you invite him in when you
66:07
invited him to come in he came in
66:10
for whatever reason you didn't speak at
66:13
that time i would encourage you to keep
66:15
pressing in i wouldn't keep asking i
66:18
know back in the day i was taught you
66:20
ask until you get you ask for hours if
66:22
you have to i think it was the holy
66:24
spirit i don't know what i think about
66:25
that if you sincerely invited him to
66:28
come and indwell you uh it empowers you
66:31
uh you you feel different number one you
66:34
feel like the power of god in you life
66:36
god in you you feel increasing in
66:38
presence of him i have no one of my own
66:41
sisters had that experience and i think
66:43
it was
66:44
some sometime
66:46
i think she's had a few syllables here
66:47
and there in tongues but let me tell you
66:49
the power of god and the prophetic began
66:51
to operate in her after she invited him
66:53
to indwell her this this is the truth
66:56
and i know that we we it says the
66:58
evidence of speaking in tongues the
67:00
evidence that's that's the outward
67:02
evidence and sign to people around you
67:04
knowing that you received him
67:06
i don't think that stops you from having
67:08
him inside of you and you may not have
67:10
ever heard any pastor or preacher ever
67:12
say that before but you invite him to
67:15
indwell you he's going to come in if
67:18
you've got christ in your heart he's
67:19
going to come in
67:20
and then i would just say holy spirit
67:22
show yourself to me
67:24
demonstrate yourself to me open up my
67:27
mouth that i can speak you know speak in
67:30
tongues
67:31
and then i would just say just start
67:33
praising him i would just start telling
67:34
people say when i would help people get
67:36
tongues sometimes you lay your hand on
67:38
sometimes if people already have a lot
67:40
of that they can lay hands on you and
67:41
then then you just start speaking in
67:43
tongues so you can't say
67:46
don't say there's only one way to get it
67:48
the one way you have to get it is you
67:50
are born again you've repented of your
67:52
sins jesus christ is in you he's your
67:54
savior and from the moment you decide to
67:57
pursue i want to speak in tongues i want
67:59
that holy language
68:01
and i will say this also when you pray
68:03
in tongues the devil doesn't know what
68:04
you're saying the devil cannot
68:06
understand
68:08
tongues which is why he doesn't want
68:10
anyone to be filled with it it's like
68:12
the perfect prayer language that you
68:14
know when you're praying what god is and
68:16
putting in you to pray it's very
68:18
powerful but i would say if you've
68:21
already asked to start thanking him is a
68:23
better term to say thank you for the
68:25
evidence of speaking in tongues i've
68:27
already received you and you need to say
68:29
that the holy spirit if you've invited
68:31
holy spirit i choose my will to invite
68:33
you to indwell my person
68:35
to to come on the inside of myself that
68:38
i might understand clearly and and have
68:41
more understanding in the presence of
68:42
god and then you start saying to him
68:44
thank you for indwelling me and thank
68:47
you for giving me open and loosen my
68:49
tongue that i can speak in the heavenly
68:51
language i would really encourage you to
68:53
do that that's that's really really good
68:55
all right this is maybe this is the last
68:57
one um we get a number of questions that
69:00
relate to
69:01
night
69:02
or things so it says i know there's no
69:04
nighttime in heaven but is there a place
69:06
where it is dark where you can see neon
69:08
lights or city lights like it is not
69:11
like it is dark sorry like it is night
69:14
because sometimes it looks beautiful
69:15
looking at night lights
69:19
there's not darkness like we have the
69:20
dark of night here it's never that dark
69:24
there are times where i would have to
69:26
say
69:27
uh the light isn't probably as
69:29
terrifically bright but i will also say
69:31
this
69:32
the first time i was taking this
69:33
somewhere in heaven where i saw those
69:35
lights you wished you could see you saw
69:38
them in in daylight what you would call
69:40
a daylight they were so bright wow it
69:43
streamed out of this whole place you saw
69:45
these brilliant lights everywhere coming
69:48
out of this one place whoops where
69:50
people would go i'm always putting my
69:51
stuff back together
69:53
one day i will have an actual studio
69:56
people there you go uh but i saw these
69:58
brilliant lines i went what is that
70:01
place i mean i was i was unknown it was
70:03
so beautiful you saw beautiful images
70:06
coming through it but these rays of
70:07
light it wasn't just oh that's a pretty
70:09
light it was moving in and out of this
70:11
place
70:13
and uh so trust me even in light the
70:16
light around you
70:18
their lights if they're going to put a
70:19
light show on they can totally they do
70:21
fireworks in heaven not the way we do
70:23
but they have fireworks in heaven and
70:25
they see them clearly but there's like
70:26
paler colors that come through the
70:28
different parts of the sky and different
70:30
parts of heaven
70:31
so i'm sure and and if you want to see
70:33
outer space from heaven you have to step
70:35
through this big doorway that's called
70:37
the observatory you're out in space
70:40
you're not just looking at it
70:42
well and that didn't you say out in
70:44
space it's not dark like we see space
70:47
now but it's isn't a color to it
70:50
oh if you're if you're out in space
70:52
around heaven you see the light of every
70:54
star no matter how far away it is the
70:57
lights of the stars the nebulas the the
71:00
all the beauty of the art i call it a
71:02
space art that god made up there you're
71:04
so far uh right now they call it deep
71:06
space or when they they go up in the
71:08
spaceships uh if they're bi planets that
71:11
make light or if they're by moons like
71:13
circling them or something they have
71:15
more light it's different in in the
71:17
celestial realm around heaven you
71:19
literally are stepping out into part of
71:22
space and seeing it for yourself so you
71:25
can do that you don't have to have a
71:27
telescope to see
71:28
but you do step through this doorway
71:30
that's another whole part that you can
71:32
see beautiful stars and nebulas and
71:34
stuff like that is there a color is
71:36
there a color
71:38
there's color there's color everywhere
71:40
out in space really and they even sell
71:42
calendars you might want to go get some
71:44
that show that they have some out right
71:46
now uh in the stores for the 2022 now
71:49
i'm pushing someone else's product you
71:51
can actually probably order just called
71:53
the galaxies it could be called the
71:55
galaxies or something like that
71:56
and it's when the um when they said some
71:59
of the
72:01
sometimes i'm not good on head knowledge
72:02
when i'm talking about revolution
72:05
they send the ships out to seek out
72:07
places and get pictures of them without
72:09
light
72:10
things like that and they've got
72:12
beautiful uh beautiful close-up pictures
72:15
of a lot of they're called nebulas they
72:17
say they're made out of gas but i know
72:19
that you know particles of gas coming
72:21
together and make a perfect eye out in
72:23
space i'm sorry people that just doesn't
72:25
come on its own yeah
72:27
things like you would look in those
72:28
calendars you would see stuff like that
72:31
stepping through the observatory
72:33
it's called the observatory there's no
72:34
telescope you just walk through this
72:36
ancient looking amazing doorway and
72:39
you're out there in in space seeing all
72:41

74:28
teaching spirit force
74:30
is the number one revelation god has
74:32
given me to train the body of christ how
74:35
to be a member of the army of god that
74:38
it talks about in the bible i'm not
74:39
talking about heaven's army you as a
74:41
member of the army of god on the earth
74:44
will learn how to use all of the weapons
74:46
he gave you spiritual weapons
74:48
and our his plan is for us to crush
74:51
darkness that's the enemy the spiritual
74:53
darkness and push it back
74:55
and you have the right to do that as a
74:57
member of the body there's a lot of
74:58
scripture in all this but the training
75:00
is the most important part and you will
75:03
everybody know we've been getting phone
75:05
calls from everywhere people want to
75:06
sign up for it and we'll have more
75:08
information on spirit force but it'll be
75:10
the number one thing i do next year all

01:34
hey welcome to the broadcast and happy
01:37
wednesday
01:38
january 19 2022
01:42
it's nice to be back sorry i've been
01:44
gone since i think the last time you saw
01:46
me was a week ago today when i did
01:50
the broadcast with kat i we had quite a
01:53
lot of stuff happening i was i was
01:55
supposed to be heading out to the clay
01:57
clark event and uh
02:00
i got taken out by one mega back injury
02:04
and so i didn't wasn't able to go and
02:06
then no sooner did we return home
02:08
from the airport with you know we were
02:11
headed toward the airport we had to turn
02:13
around and come back then drain got sick
02:15
with what we think is probably the
02:17
latest variant
02:19
uh that's going around in about two days
02:22
after that i got it so right now even as
02:24
we speak both three and i got up this
02:27
morning and even though we're doing a
02:28
lot better
02:30
we're still feeling that nausea that in
02:32
fact for me it's the first time it just
02:33
showed up same thing that happened to
02:35
her so
02:36
ah this thing holds on but anyways uh
02:39
thank you all for
02:40
honoring kelsey o'malley
02:44
she did a great great job and i'm very
02:46
much appreciated appreciative of her for
02:49
to stepping in for me but
02:51
it's nice to be back it's nice totally
02:54
nice to be back because you know i like
02:56
to be involved and i don't like to just
02:58
sit around but man
03:00
you want to sleep you want to just ah
03:02
anyway appreciate the prayers thank you
03:05
so much um
03:06
for all of you who did pray for me you
03:08
know even on the back injury that i had
03:11
i don't think we publicized this because
03:14
sometimes it's better not to you know i
03:16
had a mentor you all know who bobby
03:19
connor is and he used to teach never let
03:21
the enemies see you sweat
03:23
um and basically
03:26
the whole thing was don't make a big
03:28
deal to the enemy
03:29
how injured you are because then he
03:31
knows he's one so
03:33
so you try not to complain and you don't
03:36
say oh poor me you know
03:38
and uh so
03:40
that kind of translates well this way
03:42
too because if he told if we told
03:43
everybody oh i'm i'm laying flat on my
03:46
back with this big old injury then
03:48
everyone's worried about you so it's
03:50
almost better to just find out we have a
03:52
prayer team that are always keeping us
03:54
covered so we do cover those things in
03:56
prayer very very seriously when they
03:58
happen but we don't always make it a
04:00
general announcement so
04:02
all right well thank you for being
04:06
our loyal viewers and being coming back
04:08
so let's see what do we want to do i
04:10

so
05:05
i think that's about it
05:08
so
05:08
without further ado let's bring cat
05:10
curry here it's about time we got back
05:13
together kat
05:15
yes i i you know what i missed being
05:18
with you miss talking with you but
05:21
your team does a great job just so you
05:23
know that it was really great it was
05:24
really powerful but
05:26
i was praying i didn't know exactly what
05:28
it was but i was definitely declaring
05:30
over you and praying over you which i
05:32
actually do every day you and doreen wow
05:35
thank you something if i feel impressed
05:37
to pray something stronger than i do
05:40
and um
05:41
just because i'd like to take advantage
05:43
of any chance to train people
05:46
when you begin to have any kind of
05:48
strains whether it's your back your leg
05:51
or severe cramps you can you can learn
05:55
or train yourself to release the peace
05:57
of god into that situation and it
05:59
literally will stop that it will stop it
06:03
god told me one time i had actually
06:05
pulled a muscle or something and i kept
06:07
asking him do something he said i'm not
06:08
going to do he said you're going to do
06:10
it and he said you need to learn to
06:12
release what you already carry which is
06:14
the anointing which we all carry
06:15
according to first john 2 27 go look it
06:18
up
06:18
and the anointing brings like a peace
06:21
with it and literally you would lay on
06:23
your hand on yourself like i release i
06:25
impart the peace of god
06:27
and uh and it might work not work the
06:29
first few times but eventually you will
06:31
do that and the cramp or the pain will
06:33
go wow it has to do with muscles and
06:36
tendons or even your bones and i i have
06:39
to do that all the time if i overdo it
06:41
or for whatever reason you know i what
06:44
if for whatever reason if i have any
06:46
pinched anything or strained anything
06:48
that is the number one way i get rid of
06:50
it with the anointing
06:52
wow and you know what kat you told us
06:55
all a couple months ago you talked about
06:57
people that weren't sleeping well which
06:59
has happened to me a lot in my life in
07:01
the last few years
07:02
and you talked about i command the rest
07:04
of god i think is the way i understand
07:06
it and during i've been practicing that
07:09
the first time i thought it didn't
07:10
really get where i wanted it to go but
07:12
when i remember to do it which i usually
07:14
do if i'm having trouble
07:16
yeah and there'll be a little bit of a
07:18
delay the next thing i know i wake up in
07:20
the morning i mean it's like
07:22
it was really really powerful so if you
07:25
have insomnia anyone watching this and
07:28
what you what i would say
07:31
i had to do is i had to engage my faith
07:35
which means i had to believe that what i
07:36
was saying was gonna work or it was just
07:39
words right yeah kind of have to put
07:41
some faith in it
07:42
so it wasn't just words and then i when
07:44
i when i believe that what i say is
07:47
gonna happen i command the rest of god i
07:49
have a great night's sleep cat that was
07:52
that's a phenomenal teaching
07:54
it is and actually
07:56
it's um it's he showed me one time i was
08:00
in the mountains of north carolina he
08:02
showed me one time
08:03
how we create now i'm not talking about
08:05
when i say create people automatically
08:07
think well you know create like people
08:10
and things like that no you know you
08:12
create stuff like you come up with ideas
08:14
to create things whether it's a cake i'm
08:15
always going to say use cake for you
08:17
know don't forget to celebrate and eat
08:18
cake i'm still doing it but smaller
08:20
pieces by the way
08:22
but when you begin to create even in
08:23
heaven you learn to do this so you can
08:26
get a jump start down here on the earth
08:28
and god says the earth and your time on
08:30
earth is actually boot camp for eternity
08:33
and the greater your faith gets the more
08:36
you can get things done but when i said
08:38
your faith and god said you mean your
08:40
soul
08:41
your soul has to be engaged with
08:43
everything you believe or you speak
08:45
about which is why sometimes you don't
08:47
get good things if you're saying nothing
08:49
but negative about yourself guess what
08:50
you're going to think you're going to
08:51
think negative and it will be hard to
08:54
push through that so number one stop
08:56
saying you can't
08:58
or you won't or you don't have you have
09:01
to stop saying those words because of
09:02
course god created with words
09:05
but he taught me he said what you say
09:07
from your mouth has to line up with what
09:10
is in your soul when your soul engages
09:12
with what you're saying and you know
09:14
that is still it is still of course your
09:17
faith your faith comes from there your
09:19
your soul is your mind what you think on
09:21
your will what you decide to do in your
09:23
emotions is what you say or how you say
09:26
it so he said in order to create things
09:29
like
09:30
wholeness in your body still using the
09:32
blood of jesus of course we wouldn't
09:33
have any of this and i want to go back
09:35
to the beginning of him on the cross we
09:38
would have nothing if we didn't have him
09:41
when we create when we command it's
09:43
because of what he did for us because of
09:45
what he gave us the ability and the
09:46
right to do but even in doing this like
09:49
the believing trusting and then you step
09:52
into faith but it's all created in your
09:55
soul which is why it's important god
09:56
said he said to to guard it to guard
09:59
what that is
10:01
don't let the world let man's opinions
10:03
or thoughts of you come in at you
10:06
you say what you say is what you will
10:08
become and we know the word says that so
10:10
when you begin to engage with like i'm
10:12
having creams in my leg and i want this
10:15
to stop and i have the right to tell it
10:17
to stop i do because we were made uh
10:20
perfect in every way we're new creations
10:22
through jesus christ we speak to things
10:25
and they happen that was his whole point
10:27
of doing it when he was on the earth but
10:29
your soul engages in this whole faith
10:31
thing
10:32
if you think on it and you meditate on
10:35
it that's still your mind that's still
10:36
coming from your soul we were always
10:39
taught the soul was not a good thing but
10:40
that was wrong
10:42
a dark soul maybe but not one filled
10:44
with the light of god and the love of
10:45
god
10:46
so when you begin like the rest of the
10:48
lord will use that uh when you begin it
10:50
is still a process like you're being
10:52
trained for anything whether it's to be
10:54
an athletic or trained for business or
10:56
trained even as a baker it's a process
10:59
and the more you do it the better you
11:01
get it the better results you have it is
11:03
the same thing when you're declaring and
11:05
believing for something when you finally
11:07
believe one day and you say i command
11:10
and that's the proper word i command the
11:12
rest of the lord you're not telling god
11:13
what to do you're doing what he said he
11:15
said command you me he was saying you
11:17
say what you want done
11:19
so this all ties back to the word of god
11:21
this is outside the word this is living
11:24
the word of god and you say i command
11:26
the rest of the lord to come upon me and
11:28
you've been believing for sleep praying
11:30
for sleep
11:31
you begin to say i want the rest of the
11:33
lord i need the rest of the lord the
11:34
rest of the lord you come one day you
11:36
say that and you'll be knocked out by
11:38
god
11:40
i mean you will sleep so good all night
11:42
long and every night after that you will
11:46
be able to do that
11:48
you know and then i just said
11:50
son
11:51
i'm just telling you the people that
11:52
that's a real thing and you know it's
11:54
one thing if you hear this teacher or
11:56
that teacher
11:57
say that you know we we have lots and
12:00
lots of teachers and sometimes it's easy
12:02
to you know i don't know if they know
12:04
for sure i don't know if this is just a
12:06
theory of theirs but when kat who's been
12:09
with the father thousands of times yes
12:12
if she says this is what you're supposed
12:14
to do i take it a little more seriously
12:17
maybe i should maybe i should have taken
12:19
well not that i've heard this particular
12:21
teaching before
12:22
but you know cat it works and you know
12:26
i've spent when i i laid bedridden
12:29
people don't know this a lot of people
12:30
don't know this but from about
12:33
oh
12:34
let's see from 12 especially from about
12:37
2010 to 2012 29 i was bedridden and i
12:41
couldn't sleep i laid there night after
12:43
night i was so deprived of sleep if i
12:46
had known this yeah it would have been
12:48
different oh man that would have been so
12:51
great but you know god
12:53
this is why in this time people go well
12:55
why not before this is a special time i
12:58
don't look at the things going on around
13:00
me i don't ignore them i'm innocent of
13:02
evil i'm innocent of darkness you know
13:03
i'm filled with the light of god and
13:05
hope and power i mean hope was wonderful
13:08
but power and operating in is where god
13:10
wants us to be that's we're supposed to
13:12
be dangerous against hell you're
13:14
supposed to be filled with the light and
13:15
love of god always have an answer
13:18
for people
13:19
of truth yes but of the power of god and
13:22
living in the life of god that's what a
13:24
manifested son and daughter is it's not
13:27
some special people who'll send down to
13:29
heaven all of a sudden they'll be here
13:30
on the earth it's us
13:31
it's us it's the body of christ learning
13:33
to operate in the fullness of what he
13:36
always intended and that's why the
13:37
father normally teaches me himself this
13:40
is what you do and say and hello people
13:42
if anybody knows that would be a father
13:45
son or holy spirit and i've been trained
13:47
by all three of them why so you can be
13:50
trained and be empowered
13:52
it's it's excited to be you know you're
13:55
inspired inspiring is nice empowering is
13:58
better okay
14:00
you live above and never beneath
14:03
how can we rule if jesus said you will
14:06
rule with me in this life and in the
14:08
life to come uh your ruling is totally
14:11
different than you know i'm begging and
14:13
it's okay to ask when you don't know but
14:16
but when you begin to declare and decree
14:18
and you begin to say i'm not tolerating
14:21
sickness i'm not having sickness and the
14:23
word actually says when you bless your
14:25
food you mean you must say take sickness
14:28
far from me
14:29
and did you even know that was worse so
14:31
every time you said your blessing thank
14:32
you for the food but then add and take
14:34
sickness far from me wow wow it won't
14:37
have a chance to even come to you but
14:39
again it's a process it's something i
14:42
add all the time in my prayer when i a
14:46
blessing for your food you can add so
14:48
many things in that uh i thank you for
14:50
this food blessed to my body and i ask
14:52
for and receive your wisdom your
14:55
revelation your understanding you keep
14:58
adding because whatsoever you say is
15:00
what you will have
15:02
right whatever within you or you allow
15:04
in you is what you will become that is
15:07
up to you
15:08
okay jesus christ did his part by dying
15:11
but this was a walk in his footsteps he
15:13
was never afraid okay he was never
15:15
afraid of anything he wasn't killed
15:17
honestly he laid down his life he rose
15:20
from the dead he's the king of
15:22
everything everywhere and he wants you
15:24
to be like him so the enemies the world
15:27
the darkness is crushed and pushed back
15:29
that's how things will really begin to
15:32
change
15:33
and that's why he's having me teach
15:35
spirit force which i know that's where
15:36
this button is this is
15:39
and i'll be very soon um next month
15:42
month of march i'll actually start
15:44
teaching that uh in mass to people
15:47
really really good now i want to ask you
15:49
you mentioned something i want to drill
15:50
down on this for a second
15:52
uh when we've been hearing teaching
15:55
through the years and the decades we've
15:57
talked about someday the manifested sons
15:59
of daughters of god
16:01
and and we'd hear this or that statement
16:04
but you said something a minute ago and
16:06
i'm just gonna run this by you
16:08
have you repeat or clarify
16:10
is it possible that
16:12
two believers
16:15
uh
16:16
side by side
16:18
are walking out their life
16:21
and one of them is
16:24
just like a carnal christian and the
16:26
other person's manifested sons and
16:28
daughters of god because they're because
16:31
they're walking it out can can two
16:33
believers
16:35
one being manifested one not
16:39
yes because manifesting well that
16:41
doesn't mean you're not a believer
16:44
right you get born again this is the
16:46
beginning of everything you choose you
16:50
choose how much of god you want your
16:52
life how much time you give him and if
16:55
you are applying
16:56
just the written word of god but it says
16:59
man shall not live by bread alone but by
17:02
every word spoken from the mouth of god
17:05
and of course everything he says is
17:07
based on his word his written word and i
17:11
tell you right now i don't like it when
17:12
people leave parts of the bible out when
17:14
they decide they're going to translate
17:15
it some other way or something you can't
17:17
delete parts of the bible and i don't
17:20
like it when some people decide well i
17:22
don't think i understand that i'm going
17:23
to change this i would be very careful
17:26
if you if you get a bible that leaves
17:27
whole things out that god said would
17:29
happen i don't know that was free free
17:31
commercial from the holy spirit right
17:33
here
17:33
but i can tell you yes uh even in the
17:36
husband and wife or whatever sister
17:38
brother whatever you choose how much of
17:41
god you're gonna run after and let me
17:43
tell you what a manifested son or
17:46
daughter of god this is how the father
17:48
says it
17:49
to manifest
17:51
means to show and prove who and what you
17:55
believe by what you say the choices you
17:57
make and the power of god you operate in
18:00
wow so i
18:03
let me say this even one other way i
18:05
could be having a conversation
18:08
um making this up of course with my
18:10
let's say with my wife and i'm gonna say
18:12
you know i was at the park and i got i
18:14
got into a conversation with this nice
18:16
family member and you know what the wife
18:20
it's like she's one of the manifested
18:22
sons of god
18:24
and i could say that
18:26
and people go what what are you talking
18:28
about and and and the answer would be
18:31
because
18:32
she is manifesting everything that we've
18:35
ever been taught about what a manifested
18:38
sense of the
18:39
god
18:40
sons of god
18:42
yeah using the word sons yeah sons and
18:45
daughters of god
18:46
so that's am i saying that right someone
18:49
can just be
18:50
a manifested and someone next to them
18:52
might not be
18:54
that is true because that person was
18:56
running after god listening to us you're
18:59
applying
19:00
what you're hearing
19:02
when you go to church and sit in a pew
19:04
you know you're not just there to hear
19:06
something you're here to learn something
19:08
you're being trained okay i told you
19:10
this is all boot camp and you become uh
19:14
you the more of god you let in you
19:17
and you hunger after the more like him
19:19
you will begin to operate uh in the word
19:22
of god when god said let us make man in
19:24
our image that's father son and holy
19:26
spirit and after our likeness that's how
19:28
they operate
19:30
so literally he made us not to be him
19:34
he's not saying to him but he wants us
19:36
to operate in authority and dominion
19:38
over the darkness over the evil and if
19:40
you're over here playing around or
19:42
complaining like you know all you have
19:44
is a bad report and i'm not talking
19:46
about what you just said steve but you
19:47
know there are some people that have not
19:49
got one positive thing in their mouth to
19:51
say and if you you're very positive and
19:54
powerful and you help people
19:56
become great in god by believing he
19:58
really is hearing testimonies of
20:01
overcoming in the power of god they
20:03
begin to think differently but if you're
20:05
always only around people who speak doom
20:08
and gloom negative
20:10
you know and they say things like well
20:11
this is never going to change i can't
20:12
stand this there's so much evil
20:14
everywhere well what are you talking
20:16
about are you talking more about the
20:17
evil or more about the power of god to
20:20
demonstrate and manifest is to let
20:22
people know he is alive you walk in that
20:25
authority yourself people know you have
20:27
authority by the way you're talking
20:30
and you demonstrate that by believing it
20:32
and saying it then you even show people
20:35
how to operate like that i would
20:37
definitely say that would be an operated
20:39
son or daughter of god and it says the
20:42
earth is crying out in the word for the
20:45
manifested sons and daughters of god to
20:46
stand up okay the earth itself knows
20:50
that things aren't going right they know
20:51
the evil is trying to invade they want
20:54
us
20:54
we are his sons and daughters that's
20:57
what god calls us right he is our father
20:59
we're sons and daughters but that
21:01
doesn't mean every son or daughter
21:03
manifest and demonstrate who he is by
21:07
the way you live your life it is a
21:09
lifestyle
21:11
what i live is not just something i say
21:13
here it is my life it's how i live and i
21:16
don't change any day and you can tell
21:19
i had someone call last night and say
21:21
you know that their child
21:23
their child was like screaming
21:25
uh that their brain was hurting and to
21:28
pray for them and i know this person
21:30
said he called me that and this is the
21:32
first thing i can tell you this might as
21:33
well teach you right now
21:36
is trying to attack you as a believer
21:38
they have no right but i'm telling you
21:41
if you've learned about the devil he
21:42
does whatever and get away with and i
21:44
was taught this by another prophet um
21:47
uh
21:48
this couple they they did a lot of
21:50
discernment and deliverance and stuff uh
21:53
and they taught me that if you start
21:55
getting sharp pains in your head that is
21:57
a sign that witchcraft is trying to
21:59
affect you
22:01
and i told them after several things i
22:03
went you need to take your hand over
22:05
your child's head and say i sever all
22:08
witchcraft trying to attack my daughter
22:12
and when they did that because they had
22:14
they did have a fever it wasn't ohio and
22:16
instantly
22:17
there was a change
22:19
wow and see they don't think you know
22:22
how to do that this is one of the things
22:23
you're going to learn in um spirit um
22:25
spirit spirit force by the way is the
22:28
way you live and operate that the enemy
22:31
will run from you and actually says
22:33
satan will flee from you if you put
22:34
yourself under the hand of god and
22:36
resist him resist him isn't just saying
22:39
oh don't call me here it's like i'm
22:40
coming after you
22:42
i'm living the way god said i know who i
22:45
am who he is and i'm not tolerating you
22:47
attacking me
22:49
your life will begin to change
22:51
but like witchcraft will try to sneak in
22:53
it tries to control whatever it can get
22:55
away with but i have learned that and
22:58
every now and then i feel like there's a
22:59
spear poking me in my head but i know
23:01
what that is and i'll just say several
23:03
witchcraft right now in jesus name and
23:05
it leaves
23:06
instantly when they did that
23:09
they were shocked
23:11
that instantly there began to be a
23:13
change in their child
23:15
and when they woke up this morning all
23:17
the pain was gone it was all
23:19
that's so good so it's what we know see
23:22
that's why he doesn't want us to be
23:23
clueless
23:25
his word is is a basic foundation for us
23:28
to operate from but when you begin to
23:30
hear directly through holy spirit he
23:32
will train you how to be powerful the
23:34
father it'll never go against what he
23:36
said in his word that you can't live in
23:38
darkness and play in the enemy's camp
23:40
and think you'll have authority
23:42
how can you have authority over somebody
23:44
you're partnering partnering with right
23:46
you can't you can't run out here and
23:47
willingly sin all the time and think you
23:49
can tell them they're not coming near
23:52
you or attacking you it's a lie from
23:54
hell you either live for god
23:57
or you don't live for him and god said
24:00
i'd rather have you hot or cold and if
24:02
you lukewarm i can't do much of anything
24:04
with you that's what that scripture says
24:06
that the scriptures i'll i'll spill you
24:08
out of my mouth that does not mean he
24:10
won't love you you won't get heaven that
24:12
means he can't give you authority to do
24:14
things if you're going to play in the
24:16
middle okay you can't play in the gray
24:17
area you're in the light or the dark and
24:19
i want to add this because i always like
24:21
to give you the more the reason why god
24:23
wants you hot or cold cold you're just
24:26
not doing nothing for living over here
24:27
in the world he said all i have to do is
24:29
get that person saved and they're hot
24:32
they're already actively working in the
24:34
darkness but if you're already on fire
24:36
for god and you're operating powerfully
24:38
you right where he wants you but if
24:40
you're cold you know really still cold
24:42
doing nothing don't even know him he
24:44
said that person who already is doing
24:46
something even though it's not right
24:48
when i get them saved they will be hot
24:51
but the lukewarm they don't want to make
24:53
commitments they don't want to try to
24:55
find out more they're not hungry for him
24:57
they're just hanging on till they die
24:58
and go to heaven one day
25:00
and i i can tell you you will be so
25:02
grateful that you operated and
25:04
manifested the power of the living god
25:07
and what we're about to see in this
25:08
earth will shock people coming from
25:11
believers who run after god not step
25:14
back not jumped off the path especially
25:16
in this time you will be accelerated and
25:19
you will be operating powerfully for him
25:22
with him and because of him
25:24
jesus christ in this world
25:26
that's good well kel we have a lot of
25:28
questions before we get into them
25:30
questions about heaven and related is
25:31
there anything else you want to add are
25:33
you ready for the questions oh i'm ready
25:35
for the question all right so here's the
25:37
first question and i guess i missed this
25:39
a couple times illumination said i
25:41
missed this so here we go
25:43
uh merrill lynn
25:44
interesting spelling
25:47
m-a-r-o-l-y-n-n-e what an what a neat
25:50
way to spell maryland marilyn asked i
25:53
was born with as an idiot
25:56
twin
25:58
uh but yet we look nothing alike as many
26:00
do look like
26:02
god doesn't have even two snowflakes the
26:04
same will twins look alike in heaven
26:06
there's two questions well twins look
26:08
alike in heaven
26:10
and the second question is is there any
26:12
reason why god would give
26:14
uh two births at the same time i guess i
26:16
guess they're asking why are there twins
26:18
why did he do twins okay so first one is
26:22
what is uh will they look alike in
26:24
heaven
26:26
i'm sure it says in the bible we'll go
26:28
back to the bible it says you will be
26:29
known as you were known that means
26:31
people will recognize you like they
26:33
recognize you on the earth you'll look a
26:35
whole lot better i mean the light of
26:36
god's coming out of you you've got joy
26:38
on you you're excited all the time um so
26:41
there could be twins and maybe one was
26:43
happy one wasn't maybe it was gonna be
26:45
maybe it was whatever but he made you
26:47
for a purpose and yes he did make twins
26:50
for a purpose many times twins have a
26:53
very strong connection
26:55
and if you learn how to operate with god
26:57
with that strong connection it's it's
27:00
really it's almost like a two-fold chord
27:03
uh when you when you come together as a
27:05
twin and you have this connection that's
27:08
really different from other siblings
27:10
um it's because god made you that way on
27:13
purpose and yes you will still look like
27:14
you in heaven i see people who look
27:17
alike in heaven that they were twins on
27:19
the earth uh you don't lose that
27:21
and so but you say you have different
27:23
personalities or different likes like i
27:25
like chocolate i like vanilla whatever
27:27
stuff like that or i want to go to the
27:28
valley of the falls and you know i want
27:30
to go to passionate paradise or or i
27:32
want to go to the surf park and
27:34
everybody has their things they like but
27:36
twins and a lot of times do a lot of
27:39
things together and they have especially
27:41
a special bond and god did send people
27:44
as twins on purpose to the earth to have
27:46
that special bonding connection because
27:49
when he gets involved it's very powerful
27:52
well when they pray when they declare uh
27:54
together as twins and lots of times
27:56
they'll know what's going on with the
27:58
other even if they're not together at
27:59
all so
28:00
yeah
28:02
and if they're triplets it's even more
28:04
powerful
28:05
wow yeah wow okay that's interesting all
28:07
right simone asks
28:09
uh when we're singing and worshiping or
28:12
praying do our angels
28:14
do that with us do they or do they
28:16
worship uh with us is the actual
28:19
question do our angels worship with us
28:21
when we're worshiping
28:23
i think most of the time they're
28:25
watching up for your back
28:27
they know you're worshiping and they get
28:28
really excited i can tell you that your
28:30
angels get so excited when you anytime
28:33
you worship god if you're helping
28:35
another person they get really joyous
28:37
they get really joyous when you're
28:39
reading the word of god anytime
28:41
something you're doing that that
28:42
connects you to god but worship is very
28:45
powerful in heaven if you could see
28:47
worship in the spirit realm it's like it
28:49
does many things at one time when you
28:51
worship god from your heart you're so
28:54
dangerous against how missiles like
28:56
missiles come from you and shoot up into
28:58
the second heaven and they bust things
29:00
up in the second heaven because all
29:02
worship goes to god from this earth to
29:04
him that's where it goes actually goes
29:07
to these golden bowls before the altar
29:09
sometimes they come directly into him
29:11
and then he'll take it and he'll himself
29:13
put it in the gold i'm talking about the
29:14
father he'll put your praises like
29:17
incense and they'll put in these golden
29:18
bowls and when they're full he tips them
29:20
and the move of god comes to the earth
29:22
but you're also crushing plans of the
29:25
enemy when you worship
29:27
it is very powerful and it makes jesus
29:31
really really happy because you're
29:33
connecting saying you're hungry for him
29:36
any songs that adore him are the most
29:39
popular ones in heaven if it adores him
29:41
and who christ is and speaks about his
29:44
divinity or or what he has done for us
29:47
here on the earth they love it your
29:49
angels love it when you sing or worship
29:51
him so it's very powerful i see them in
29:54
the meetings worship i'll see them
29:56
worshiping their worship a lot more wild
29:58
than we do though many times they're
30:00
dancing they're spinning
30:02
um they'll walk in and out of you all
30:04
the time that you're worshiping your own
30:06
angels well the whole ceiling fills in
30:09
the sanctuary or wherever you're having
30:12
these meetings if it's outside if you
30:14
could see the seer the whole sky would
30:16
light up with the glory of god from the
30:18
worship coming from you
30:20
sends light into the darkness yeah did
30:22
you just say
30:24
your angels walk in and out of you did
30:26
did i hear you right okay you explained
30:29
that what do you mean because that's and
30:31
and do they they do that now not just in
30:34
heaven but they do that now they walk
30:37
what's what's going on when they do that
30:39
what happened
30:41
they're a spiritual being that's why
30:43
they can walk through the walls this
30:45
physical world is the second realm
30:48
the original realm was a spiritual realm
30:51
where all of things of god that's where
30:53
they live before he made a canvas and
30:55
put all the stars and the planets on it
30:58
it was only a spiritual world but it was
31:00
a literal world well because they're
31:03
protecting and guarding us oh they step
31:05
in and out sometimes i see you sit
31:07
actually
31:08
inside your angels sometimes or you
31:11
stand inside your angels they're always
31:13
right there by you uh uh and around you
31:16
no matter where you go sometimes you
31:18
walk through them and you don't even
31:19
know you're doing that because it's
31:21
they're they're spiritual beings
31:24
is it a protection thing uh because i've
31:27
never really explored this with you when
31:28
they walk in
31:30
you i get that they're spirit beings and
31:33
they can walk through walls and see men
31:35
in anything but when they're walking
31:37
through you what's being is something
31:39
must be being accomplished or they
31:40
wouldn't bother right so
31:43
they're making deposits god will send to
31:45
bother that you know it says your angel
31:47
memory he says in the bible that your
31:50
your angel's face is always before the
31:52
father remember that it says in the
31:53
bible oh yeah you always have more than
31:55
one you always have more than one
31:58
because one is always always with you
32:00
and so they'll take turns going before
32:02
the father sometimes they're saying
32:04
things or whatever he's calling them up
32:06
there and i've seen them
32:09
doing many things especially during a
32:11
meeting where they have mass miracles
32:13
they bring they're the ones who bring
32:14
the body parts down from heaven
32:16
your angel usually will get your body
32:19
part if you're lacking or need something
32:21
replaced or
32:23
if you've asked for uh like
32:25
help me with kindness i want more
32:26
kindness they'll the father will send a
32:29
deposit of kindness and they'll walk
32:30
through you and then part it into you
32:32
they'll literally hold it and walk
32:33
through you and put it inside of you in
32:35
your spirit
32:36
the uh i'm thinking of a specific
32:38
relative of mine i won't name it um
32:41
and they're walking away from the lord
32:43
and there's a whole bunch of new age
32:45
stuff going on and there's pictures on
32:47
the wall where they're doing this and
32:49
they're doing all these and they're
32:51
walking that's what they're doing
32:53
so what are their
32:54
angels have their do their angels leave
32:57
them because they're in this state do
32:59
their angels double up because they need
33:01
more help what what goes on
33:04
it depends on who's praying for those
33:06
people usually now if god has assigned
33:09
them to you your your guardian angel
33:11
comes while you're in the womb
33:13
it's waiting for you to be born
33:15
so they're with you before you get
33:17
involved in anything you have any
33:19
understanding of anything they're with
33:20
you from the time you're little and if
33:22
you see babies smile which i was holding
33:25
one the other night um they were looking
33:27
at my angel they couldn't take their
33:29
eyes off of my angel because i could see
33:31
my angel and my angels behind me or it
33:33
comes around me and they would look at
33:35
the angel continually i could see their
33:37
angels all the time they were right
33:38
there with that around that baby they
33:41
were somewhere in the room they had like
33:42
five different angels with them so
33:44
they're a prophet
33:46
they will be a prophet they're not gonna
33:48
become one they are one and so they have
33:50
more
33:51
depending on the assignment that god
33:53
gives you you have more angels if in a
33:56
different season in your life maybe you
33:57
normally have three he could send five
33:59
or ten more depending on where you're
34:01
going to be going for him or doing for
34:03
him so that changes but you always have
34:06
the ones he originally sent
34:08
waiting outside i see pregnant women all
34:10
the time with angels following them
34:12
around that is that babies angels so
34:15
they're with you from that time and a
34:17
lot of babies begin to smile they go
34:19
with looking at nothing and smiling no
34:20
they're looking at their own angels
34:22
and so uh the the angelic have a very
34:25
powerful assignment from god and it does
34:28
say he sends them to keep you and
34:29
protect you in all your ways
34:32
so most of the time it is sort of like a
34:35
protection thing
34:37
that they're assigned to you and
34:38
sometimes they've said whisper things in
34:40
your ear like make sure you stop don't
34:43
go if the lights change don't go yet
34:45
many times at your own angel saying that
34:48
to you
34:49
and of course the more of god you have
34:51
in you and uh people go i don't even
34:53
know what that means well do you
34:54
meditate about him do you talk to him
34:57
like he's actually there
34:58
people how do i build a relationship you
35:00
act like he's really there
35:02
and you talk to him just like as if you
35:04
could see him just tell him you know i
35:06
love you i'm so grateful to you for what
35:07
you've done i'm so excited about the
35:09
things that are about to take place in
35:11
the earth no matter what the news or
35:12
anyone else is saying you're believing
35:14
what god's timing is and the more you do
35:17
that the clearer you hear holy spirit
35:20
father of jesus christ
35:22
and i do know this the more that you
35:24
step out begin to believe what his word
35:27
says and then you live like you believe
35:29
it your spiritual ears will begin to be
35:33
open so my question on on this cat is
35:37
there are so you and i know
35:39
tons of people or stories about the same
35:43
that people who are called a high
35:45
calling in their life and something
35:47
happened and they began to just walk
35:49
away
35:50
and they began to experiment and they'll
35:53
one day they'll tell their story they
35:55
say i just was running away from god as
35:58
fast as i could go they'll say that so
36:00
when they're running away
36:03
and then in fact when they're what they
36:05
usually mean is i did this and i'm doing
36:07
this and i started doing that
36:09
what what are their angels
36:13
oh they don't leave
36:15
okay
36:16
they do not leave they're right there
36:18
beside you the whole time
36:20
and sometimes the choices you make
36:22
yourself as a person may get yourself in
36:25
a lot of trouble or maybe you begin to
36:28
reject the words of god i'm not saying
36:31
you abandon necessarily being a
36:33
christian it's like you're going more to
36:36
another another way like leaning on your
36:38
own understanding not what you learn
36:40
from the word and maybe you make
36:42
decisions where you yourself can get
36:44
hurt or whatever they double up what
36:46
they're doing for you i mean they don't
36:48
leave you they still try to influence
36:50
you
36:51
a lot of times they're shaking their
36:53
head i mean uh even they don't
36:56
sometimes they really do i see them roll
36:58
their eyes sometimes i think they're
37:00
saying the angels they have they have
37:02
personalities they're not robots
37:05
some will just begin to pray really hard
37:07
for you the other ones are like rolling
37:09
their eyes at you like come on
37:13
come on you need to you need to
37:14
understand you shouldn't be doing that
37:15
you shouldn't be going into that place
37:18
they will try to influence you if you go
37:20
into places that are really not good
37:21
they'll actually cover their eyes
37:24
wow and
37:26
they'll cover their eyes but they won't
37:27
leave you when
37:29
did you say
37:31
because we're talk about that our angels
37:33
do this they protect here
37:35
they stand and you know they block this
37:37
but did you say your angels pray for you
37:41
do angels pray so our angels pray like
37:44
we pray
37:46
they've got a prayer life as well is
37:48
that what you're saying life it's a
37:49
little bit different from ours
37:52
because they know the things the father
37:55
can do they know the things jesus christ
37:57
died for they'll begin to repeat what
37:59
the word has said and they will be
38:01
declaring the word over those people
38:03
that they have been assigned to they
38:05
don't just do it for anybody but the
38:07
ones that they were assigned to from the
38:08
time you know before they were born they
38:10
were sent to take them
38:12
when you die your guardian angel is the
38:14
one who escorts you to heaven whether
38:17
you're picked up in a chariot or where
38:19
you're picked up but some other way
38:20
there's many ways you can be transported
38:22
to heaven your own guardian angel when
38:24
you step out of this physical body and
38:26
your spirit man steps out the first
38:28
thing you'll see will be your own angel
38:31
good well well all right well um
38:34
this is a good question um this is
38:37
renee's asking i i he says i see or he i
38:40
can't tell i take care of my 98 year old
38:44
mother
38:45
who has dementia
38:46
who has dementia how can i lead her to
38:48
the lord i've tried to be simple but she
38:51
says quote what are you talking about
38:54
close quote
38:56
yeah when some people not everybody
38:59
i'd say that very carefully my mom is 90
39:02
she's sharp as attack people
39:04
and so um
39:05
it's just some people aren't some aren't
39:07
um what you do in that situation or i
39:10
can add something even more to that if
39:12
they're in the hospital and they're not
39:13
responding
39:14
you can speak to their spirit man
39:17
and i tell people there actually have
39:19
been people came back and get tested and
39:21
said even though i wasn't responding my
39:23
body wasn't responding i heard every
39:25
word you said their spirit may inherit
39:28
it i tell people don't ever stop
39:30
believing for their salvation don't ever
39:32
stop doing that and you can just say
39:34
very politely make sure you know jesus
39:36
christ
39:37
can can i help you pray to him
39:41
if they were born again and got born
39:42
again at a young age it's like god keeps
39:45
this
39:46
i don't want to say he has a hook in you
39:48
but it makes him you have a tie to him
39:51
you know it says that jesus is married
39:53
to the backslider right doesn't it say
39:55
that so even though you get off an area
39:57
you shouldn't be he doesn't leave you he
39:59
always has hope that you will recognize
40:02
him and go back to what you believed in
40:04
the beginning and so that's why your
40:06
angels will still pray and declare you
40:09
know to these people but as far as a
40:11
senior uh sometimes the closer they get
40:14
to 100 somewhere over 100 is still sharp
40:17
it depends on every single person is
40:19
different their soul processes things
40:21
differently some days are clearer than
40:24
other days so don't give up you know
40:27
speaking of being very gentle when you
40:28
speak to them whether and they're
40:30
already of the age while they're
40:31
sleeping is a good time to speak to them
40:34
that's good
40:35
does not ever sleep
40:37
and i i tell people still speak to them
40:39
still leave them in a prayer of
40:41
salvation if they're really
40:43
while they're asleep
40:44
please do that wow
40:47
you're serious you can lead a person
40:55
yes
40:56
and their spirit man can respond it will
41:00
totally respond and we ourselves have
41:03
heard i've lived in church my entire
41:04
life okay we were almost born on a pew i
41:06
tell people that's where we were every
41:09
service it was a six week six week
41:11
revival we were there every single
41:12
meeting uh that's where we lived it was
41:15
like our second home and so we heard a
41:17
lot of testimonies sometimes people miss
41:20
but we heard testimonies of people who
41:22
were in comas in the hospital and
41:24
they're and they weren't born again and
41:25
they their loved one would visit them
41:27
all the time they would put their hand
41:28
on them they would pray over them they
41:30
themselves would say now i believe that
41:32
you can hear me even though your flesh
41:34
can't respond i'm going to lead you in
41:36
this prayer and they would lead them in
41:38
the sinner's prayer like at least once
41:40
when they were coming to visit them and
41:42
now they they didn't die and go to
41:44
heaven these people lived they came back
41:46
and they said i heard you every time
41:50
you led me in that prayer i had to say
41:52
it now this was their spirit man even
41:54
though their flesh was then speaking
41:56
this was the actual person who came back
41:59
woke up out of the coma and said i heard
42:01
you say that every time he spoke to me
42:03
and they said thank you for not giving
42:04
up giving up on me but while i was out
42:08
my spirit man heard you and i received
42:10
christ
42:11
wow
42:12
you know there's no teaching about this
42:14
i mean this is wonderful news because i
42:17
didn't know you could lead someone to
42:18
the lord when they're in a coma or when
42:20
they're
42:21
when they're asleep that's phenomenal
42:23
cat i mean
42:25
your soul
42:26
you know your three parts right body
42:28
soul and spirit your soul never sleeps
42:32
your soul doesn't need to sleep it's a
42:34
spiritual thing your spirit man never
42:36
sleeps it's always awake and i encourage
42:40
people play some really powerful amazing
42:42
music in the room especially if people
42:44
are not feeling well the best thing you
42:46
can do
42:48
unless you if you're given a medicine
42:49
they've told you to give them medicine
42:51
this is before the whole virus thing i'm
42:53
not talking about that at all i'm not in
42:55
my opinions of that right now but
42:57
normally just not feeling well or maybe
42:59
the under doctor's care the best thing
43:01
you can do for that person is to play
43:04
the word of god or being spoken or to
43:07
play music that brings the presence of
43:10
god your spirit man and your soul will
43:12
get very strong because of that
43:15
but i always have encouraged people
43:17
since being young
43:19
don't give up on your family member and
43:21
please if you if you're standing for
43:22
their salvation
43:24
you'll find out later in heaven when you
43:26
see them there what your words spoke and
43:28
made a difference in their life so it's
43:30
important but again you can't you can't
43:33
sell the bad wicked evil things you're
43:35
saying if you're over here standing
43:36
right you're being double minded
43:39
yeah
43:40
you're staying in that gap you stay
43:42
there you declare over them i'm not
43:44
saying you have to pray pray
43:46
24 hours a day
43:47
back in the day you know i'm coming from
43:49
like born in the 50s people so i've seen
43:52
just about every move of god since the
43:53
50s there has been
43:55
and was a part of a lot of them and i'm
43:58
like i was surprised at what people
44:00
didn't understand god could do and and
44:03
would he actually do it and i'm like do
44:05
you not believe there is a god i mean i
44:07
think number one you really have to
44:09
believe when you receive christ it's he
44:12
steps inside of you he's there he's
44:15
actually with you all the time not just
44:17
your angels
44:19
and so i encourage people he's there
44:21
he's never going to leave yet says so
44:22
why not talk to him like i'm talking to
44:25
you like i can't see you but i feel like
44:27
i'm talking to thousands of people right
44:29
now when i speak and i'm serious like
44:32
steve said i'm serious everything god
44:34
taught me i had to live it that's how i
44:37
know these things work
44:39
but when when a mass of the body begins
44:42
to believe and live like he really is
44:45
and declare it and begin to speak to
44:47
things around you you'll be shocked how
44:50
different your life is you'll come home
44:52
walk into the presence of god because
44:54
you've invited a habitation of heaven by
44:57
what you're saying in your home where no
44:59
one's watching or looking what are you
45:02
watching what are you letting in your
45:03
home what are you letting come in from
45:05
the tv from the computer um it says in
45:08
the bible we'll be we will be held
45:10
account for every word
45:12
you know that we speak i'm not saying if
45:13
you're a believer you won't go to heaven
45:15
but
45:16
don't use wasteful things i don't spend
45:19
your time repeating what they're
45:21
advertising about hell going on in the
45:23
earth right now
45:24
are you talking more about god and his
45:27
plans and his power are you talking more
45:29
about the power of the enemy and that's
45:31
how fear gets into people if all you're
45:33
talking about is how afraid you are and
45:35
how wicked and bad and evil everything
45:37
is out there people don't even think
45:38
about god if i talk about the life of
45:40
god and his power and his plans that he
45:43
has for this earth he made it he held it
45:46
in his hands and made this earth he's
45:49
not ignoring anything he knows what's
45:51
going on in justice i just have to say
45:53
holy spirit saying yes
45:54
justice has already been released from
45:56
heaven
45:57
it's waiting to act
45:59
so why not tell your children ask your
46:02
children what is god saying to you can
46:04
you hear his voice he wants to speak to
46:06
you do you know god wants you to be
46:08
great for him that the invention
46:10
creativity that will happen in your
46:11
lifetime will be phenomenal
46:13
this little baby i was holding all i
46:15
said was powerful exciting things a
46:18
little baby like a month old
46:20
and that baby began to grin and almost
46:22
laugh at the words i was giving was life
46:25
to them
46:26
okay it was life to this little tiny
46:29
baby who who didn't really know anything
46:32
except that was somebody speaking light
46:34
and life to him and he didn't really
46:36
know me but it didn't matter i was
46:38
giving him what god was saying about him
46:40
and it was changing the way he responded
46:43
in seconds
46:45
so
46:47
what are you feeding your family with
46:49
your words
46:50
are you giving them life
46:52
are you empowering them inspiring them
46:55
to be something great for god regardless
46:57
of what's going on in this world this
46:59
world does not own you
47:01
okay you're in the hand of god if you
47:02
belong to him expect him expectancy with
47:06
god is just as powerful as reading the
47:08
word and praying expectancy
47:10
i say i ask for and receive expectancy
47:13
the expectancy and the excitement god
47:15
that you carry i ask for that and i bind
47:17
that to my soul and it's one of the
47:19
reasons why i say excited but if all
47:22
you're saying is did you hear what they
47:23
said here did you hear that now this is
47:25
what happened and don't say no this is
47:27
going to happen say i'm i'm not
47:28
tolerating any of this stuff being
47:30
forced i decide what god wants for me
47:33
i'm living in my life's going in in that
47:36
direction the only new normal for me
47:37
will be god invading my place that's
47:40
good that's good
47:42
to wrap up then let me i want to really
47:44
clarify this 98 year old mother who has
47:47
dementia which means
47:49
she just she's not there she may or may
47:51
not be there at all
47:53
she's yeah or if she remembers something
47:55
it's for 30 seconds i know my mom's
47:57
headed that way so if whether it's a 98
48:00
year old mother who has dementia like
48:02
this question
48:04
or a 10 year old or 20 year old
48:07
who has me who is so mentally challenged
48:10
that they they do not relate to language
48:13
as you and i know it
48:15
okay so they so as far as we know their
48:18
brain doesn't work
48:20
even in that case you while they're
48:23
asleep you can lead them to the lord
48:25
right
48:26
i will say this because i have to add
48:28
anyone who is um of an older age or even
48:32
like you said 20 if they're mentally
48:34
challenged
48:36
if their physical brain doesn't operate
48:38
like ours god treats them like a little
48:41
child
48:43
and and let me tell you even at the time
48:45
of their death he will present himself
48:47
to them
48:48
he will lead them to him himself
48:52
he is not an unjust god and if that was
48:55
if that's how they were born or
48:56
something happened to them and mentally
48:59
they can't process or they can't think
49:01
he does not hold that against them but
49:03
they are treated by god as a child as a
49:07
young child and he's not going to send
49:09
them to hell he will make sure they have
49:11
an opportunity to know him in the bible
49:14
it says i make myself known to every man
49:17
that means every human being
49:20
so that part i can tell you the mentally
49:22
challenged like that god knows that
49:25
they're like a child but i would totally
49:27
still speak to them and say jesus loves
49:30
you
49:31
if that's all you can get into them it's
49:33
going to go in their spirit it will
49:35
begin to actually affect them if you put
49:38
words of life in them god loves you he
49:40
sent you here uh to be with us you know
49:42
we love you god uh has plans for you one
49:46
day you'll get to see him in person
49:48
those are words of hope
49:50
well anytime hope uh
49:53
the hope brings glory to god which is in
49:56
the word of god christ in you is the
50:00
hope of glory that you saying words of
50:03
hope to people that draws the glory of
50:06
god and that can even bring healing it
50:08
can begin to change physically the way
50:10
their brain operates
50:12
and and they've even tested that on
50:14
plants just relating a plant who has no
50:17
real life a plant you speak kind words
50:20
to and encourage this plant i love that
50:22
you're growing how beautiful you are wow
50:25
really
50:26
they have proved scientifically
50:29
some plants that they're bashed and
50:31
falsely accused they did this is a real
50:34
i had many trials done in science labs
50:37
that plant died
50:39
but the one that had words of hope and
50:42
power and those released that plant
50:44
flourished these are living things not
50:47
with the soul but the living in their
50:50
words affected the plants how do you
50:53
think they're going to be in to affect
50:54
the soul of a person no matter what kind
50:57
of situation their physical man is in
51:00
their spirit man is made perfect their
51:02
spirit man is made perfect and your
51:05
spirit sometimes leaps for joy even if
51:08
your physical man doesn't understand it
51:10
so i have to say
51:12
these people who say you know it's
51:13
important what you say be kind to people
51:16
even some of them if they don't have an
51:17
understanding of god they have learned
51:19
their self
51:20
kindness and hope begin to change people
51:24
even people who aren't nice even people
51:27
with all their mental faculties it
51:29
matters what you say to people
51:31
and and i always try to find someone
51:34
some every day to be kind to or to help
51:36
or to give them hope and i don't know
51:39
these people and they don't even know
51:41
who i am but when you release words of
51:44
hope it like pierces the darkness
51:47
in a person and light begins to come
51:50
from the words you speak words look like
51:52
little missiles of light going into a
51:55
person's spirit
51:57
and will begin to affect their natural
51:59
man
52:01
that's good that's good now you we had
52:03
talked to they someone wrote here that
52:06
was episode 57 where you said there will
52:08
become
52:09
cities of light that will start to
52:11
happen
52:12
and the person's asking in reference to
52:14
that
52:15
is this something that we can look
52:17
forward to in our live lifetime and how
52:20
soon
52:21
if there's any concept you have as far
52:23
as when will this happen or how soon can
52:25
we look forward to cities of light
52:28
i absolutely expect that to happen
52:30
probably in most people's lifetime
52:33
um because i have to say god has talked
52:36
about a divine decade a double decade
52:39
which would be like 2000 i think that
52:41
was like 2000 2010 2000 2010 2020 2020
52:46
like to 2040
52:48
so many major changes are going to come
52:50
and i have been telling people watch for
52:53
the first three months of this year for
52:56
things to be seen and heard you haven't
52:58
seen or heard wow i'm i'm not saying the
53:01
whole the whole flip they call it flip
53:03
whatever you can call it it's actually a
53:05
turning more than is like a flip thing
53:08
but when you begin to see that the hand
53:10
god turning his hand
53:13
literally what you will begin to see in
53:15
these next few months is so much
53:18
darkness will come to light there's a
53:20
lot of darkness out there a lot of it's
53:22
still hidden people are getting away
53:24
with things but in these first three
53:25
months you will see
53:27
major people exposed and never thought
53:30
they would be exposed and and that is
53:32
very key to what he is doing in the
53:35
earth now but i fully expect regions of
53:39
regions of light to exist on the earth
53:41
because i was taken into the regions of
53:43
light and i do happen to know this city
53:45
i live in will become a region of light
53:48
he showed me at one point demons leaving
53:51
the city like dust they were leaving
53:54
like dust because the glory of god was
53:56
beginning to be embedded here and coming
53:58
from the people who live here
54:01
begin to operate and what he has called
54:03
them to operate in and i know there's a
54:06
lot of people coming to florida what
54:07
they don't understand and i'm laughing
54:10
at certain people who just bought
54:11
property here from the left
54:14
they're stepping into the greatest
54:15
battle station on earth god said florida
54:17
was the battle station of the host on
54:19
earth so they're stepping into a very
54:22
dangerous place
54:24
yeah yeah there's some people that'll
54:27
probably lose that property that they're
54:29
and other people
54:31
other people that will that will join
54:34
join the kingdom you know so let's see
54:36
um this is just let me add one more
54:39
thing go ahead yes please when he showed
54:41
me this about this city um we were sent
54:44
here back in 61 though we have no
54:46
intention of leaving by the way there's
54:48
150 of us people um
54:50
and some of them are rednecks i don't
54:52
think i'm a redneck but i tell you what
54:54
i am a manifested daughter of god and i
54:55
already know that if you don't like it
54:57
why don't you start living it okay i'm
54:59
not against you being that it's what you
55:02
choose but he caught me up into space
55:06
over the earth by the way it was round
55:09
there you go again the holy spirit
55:11
always does that i love it there's no
55:13
flat earth he never made a flat earth
55:15
heaven is not flat earth is a shadow of
55:18
heaven god's home is a world a whole
55:20
world bigger than our probably of
55:22
everything that you can see out there
55:23
but he caught me up and he had put a
55:25
grid around the earth like a grid you
55:27
know people know what a great is up
55:29
above the earth and there were states
55:32
were lighting up he began to light up
55:34
these states
55:35
that i saw and he said these will all be
55:37
regions of light and there were more
55:39
regions of light than of darkness really
55:43
oh yeah more regions of light because
55:45
the body will begin to get and
55:46
understand who they are begin to operate
55:48
in the fullness of what christ gave them
55:51
and the more they see it happen the more
55:52
they'll get so inspired and excited and
55:55
then they become empowered because of
55:58
running after jesus christ i think there
56:00
also will be
56:01
many sightings of christ now in saying
56:04
all that the enemy will be out there
56:06
trying to demonstrate he is somebody and
56:08
he has something which at one point a
56:10
lot of people will laugh at because
56:12
there's so much of god around that's how
56:15
different it's going to be i saw regions
56:17
of light i told people already las vegas
56:19
will be a region of las vegas and reno
56:21
will both be a region of light i saw
56:23
california as a region of light people
56:25
so no matter what's going on there now
56:28
they better change or they won't want to
56:30
stay because you know what the devil
56:31
doesn't want to stay where a lot of god
56:33
is he just doesn't want to and it what
56:36
will happen is so many people will begin
56:37
to run to god and demonstrate and the
56:40
miraculous that will be happening the
56:42
new inventions and stuff this is what's
56:44
coming this is going to be your new norm
56:47
so why not prepare your children that
56:49
greatness is coming they're going to be
56:50
a part of this don't don't ever let fear
56:52
be put in your children by lies that are
56:54
being told everywhere you will see some
56:57
of the best the greatest justice you've
56:59
ever seen on the earth but on the other
57:00
side of that the greatest celebration
57:03
the greatest invention and uh people
57:05
being inspired people caring about each
57:08
other some churches will not make a
57:10
denomination anymore they're just going
57:12
to belong to jesus christ not that there
57:14
won't be some organizations out there uh
57:16
i'm just saying life will be so
57:19
different
57:20
that people will want to know christians
57:23
that is how different it will be from
57:25
now they won't be listening to the left
57:28
it will start to slipped it out they
57:30
won't be listening to things that are
57:31
the darkness or doom and gloom or the
57:33
takeover theory that isn't what's going
57:35
to happen okay the only theory that's
57:37
going to happen is jesus christ the
57:39
plans of jesus christ the timeline of
57:42
god and that's why he shows me things so
57:44
i can empower you by these words and if
57:47
you're from the other side you don't
57:48
like me it's too late people you're
57:50
filled with the anointing you can't get
57:52
rid of it
57:55
that's really good by the way that's a
57:56
really good word about california
57:58
because i was raised in california and
58:00
i've been thinking man maybe i need to
58:02
because i just thought one day when i
58:04
buy my uh vacation home okay that's not
58:08
now but one day
58:10
um
58:11
i'd like it to be in california but i
58:13
thought maybe i better change that maybe
58:15
that needs to be in florida where
58:16
there's actual freedom but you're saying
58:19
kevin he never played both places steve
58:21
it's okay okay that sounds good you know
58:24
what i need is one of those portal doors
58:27
that i can walk through
58:29
so hey by the way speaking of portal
58:32
doors you said in heaven there's doors
58:35
that you walk through and then suddenly
58:36
you're in another place
58:38
cat is there a time in the future where
58:42
where there's a reality on earth or are
58:45
there seers that kind of do that now on
58:48
earth where they walk through a place
58:50
and suddenly they're in singapore or
58:52
suddenly they're in you know whatever
58:55
timbuktu have you heard about that kind
58:57
of thing
58:58
i have heard about it actually it's been
59:00
several years since i heard the people
59:02
now
59:03
and there's a lot into saying that whole
59:05
thing and i always take time to explain
59:08
i'm not saying every single person would
59:10
be able to do that that's not what i'm
59:12
saying and and i'm saying some of them
59:14
didn't even know how it happened i know
59:17
how that happens in the spirit but i'm
59:19
not saying every person who god just
59:21
inspires you and he'll say step in there
59:23
and they'll open the door and step in
59:24
and they won't be in that same room
59:26
they'll be somewhere else sometimes
59:27
it'll be just that simple
59:29
i do know there are people that
59:30
understand about going in and out of the
59:33
spirit realm but you have to be very
59:35
careful i'm not saying that out of fear
59:37
i'm saying that out of wisdom and let
59:39
the holy spirit guide you and all that
59:41
there's some people who think well we
59:42
can all do this and then they get they
59:44
forget who jesus christ is they forget
59:46
he's a part of this and now they have to
59:49
say it will happen more and more but yes
59:52
it does that's how people travel in
59:53
heaven a lot of them will step into a
59:56
door or into beams of light and they
59:58
will take them to a whole different
59:59
place in heaven there absolutely is
60:01
going to be new ways to travel like
60:03
trains will run on beams of light not on
60:06
rails on the ground that is absolutely
60:08
going to happen on this that's here on
60:09
earth and you're saying that's here
60:11
here on earth that will happen here
60:13
they'll have ways to like hold highways
60:15
that will be from um
60:18
i don't understand because you know i
60:20
had a 12th grade education decided to
60:21
disappoint you people uh i've i've
60:24
graduated from the college in heaven but
60:26
but not on the earth okay and it's okay
60:29
to pursue a higher education just don't
60:30
let that place tell you there is no god
60:33
just very where you go but i can tell
60:36
you yes i was shown things that would
60:38
literally be created on the earth and i
60:41
do know this and will still say five
60:43
major diseases including cancer will no
60:45
longer exist on this earth and that will
60:48
not be very far down the road it may not
60:51
i'm not saying it'd be 10 20 years down
60:52
the road at all i think those are going
60:54
to happen probably within the next
60:57
several years maybe between five and ten
60:59
years these five major diseases won't be
61:01
on the earth that alone will change
61:03
people's lives new ways to transport
61:06
that won't cost a lot of money energy
61:08
comes down from up in space
61:10
captured and brought to this earth will
61:12
not be very far down the road that that
61:14
happens and it may not be in somebody's
61:16
lifetime but i was shown i saw a lot of
61:20
buildings and things that remained the
61:21
same i saw a lot of things that were
61:23
different i've been taking you know five
61:25
years in the future 15
61:27
30 50 100
61:30
almost 150 years and guess what the
61:32
tribulation hadn't happened people
61:34
stopped trying to ride out on the
61:35
rapture rug the loading state the
61:38
greater things you will see happen on
61:40
the earth if i was somebody well i am
61:42
somebody
61:43
i want to be here as long as he has me
61:46
here
61:47
because i can make a difference in the
61:50
lives of people and i already know
61:52
what's coming
61:53
and the medical field will change
61:55
educational field will change the
61:56
business world will majorly change uh
61:59
and even the christian world itself
62:02
would begin to actually act like there
62:04
is a god people other nations and high
62:07
level people will seek people out to
62:09
find out where they got revelation from
62:11
and and and actually take it and act on
62:14
it so there's things hidden in the
62:16
ground like well not just the glory but
62:18
i'm talking about natural things hidden
62:20
that we will discover that will help
62:22
improve our life in this world and this
62:25
is god's plan for these days he chose
62:28
you in a powerful time on the earth all
62:30
the stuff going on around you
62:33
is about exposing evil
62:35
it is not about evil taking over you
62:38
know and cat uh you know who kathy
62:41
walters is and she was a friend of
62:43
arthur burt who's gone home to be at the
62:45
lord bert with a teeth there's a burke
62:47
with a k we're not talking about that
62:49
one is arthur burt with the t he's one
62:51
of them that said 2012
62:53
uh was the beginning of
62:56
the kingdom age he's one of those
62:59
but before he went and he he tells the
63:01
story about he was in an airport
63:03
and and he wanted to use the restroom
63:05
and god said take your bags with you to
63:08
the air to the bathroom he goes lord i
63:10
don't need take your bags with you to
63:13
the bathroom so he goes into the
63:15
bathroom with his bags he comes out and
63:17
he's in another country
63:19
airplane you know so that that's not
63:22
technology that per se that's that's an
63:25
encounter that's a supervision
63:28
you know josh uh i can't think of he
63:30
plays the keyboard
63:32
josh joshua people know who i'm talking
63:34
about um he's a he's a young youngish
63:37
man i mean he's probably 40s or
63:39
something but he's been transported
63:42
philip the philip the deacon all he was
63:44
was a deacon and he was transported so
63:47
that is going to happen more and more
63:49
isn't it yes it will absolutely happen
63:52
more and more yes it will
63:54
and we've heard you and i have heard and
63:56
as we wrap up here you know i've heard i
63:58
think man well
64:00
johnson who said that you know god took
64:03
him
64:04
forward in time
64:06
this is a few years ago to 2022
64:09
and and no one was wearing masks you
64:11
remember that story he said no one was
64:13
wearing this and he said
64:15
and he asked someone what and he
64:17
realized he was
64:18
he said what year is this and the person
64:20
said it's 20 22 and he said who's the
64:23
president
64:24
and they said donald trump so you know
64:27
i've been looking forward to that
64:28
because god took him there
64:30
you know and
64:31
kat let me ask you a question about
64:34
that
64:35
make this kind of the final one you've
64:37
said
64:38
god has taken you
64:41
and shown you the future when he shows
64:44
you that there's these different kinds
64:46
of encounters one is you're with him and
64:48
then he just shows you the future he
64:50
takes you there another one is he
64:52
transports you
64:55
as he literally transports you which
64:58
which is it when he when god takes you
65:00
to show you the future
65:03
um
65:04
well most of the time if he starts
65:05
talking about the future he literally
65:07
takes me there okay like i'm there like
65:10
i'm walking on the ground i see all the
65:12
stuff around me i hear the sights and
65:14
the aromas i see the activity
65:16
and
65:17
when that's happened to you you should
65:19
never forget that you should never
65:21
forget that
65:22
but um he's also taken to me to other
65:25
places he's taken me backward in time
65:27
like literally transported me i felt
65:30
myself moving one time and i was taken
65:33
back to the tomb of christ after the
65:35
stone had been rolled away i actually
65:38
did that and was in the garden that was
65:40
before i was with you all and elijah
65:42
listen we visited that same place i saw
65:45
the same two angels there
65:48
that were there when i was taken back
65:50
wow those angels were still there and
65:53
you know they were because when they
65:54
came to look and they said why are you
65:56
looking for the living
65:57
among the dad remember those angels have
65:59
said that those are the same angels who
66:00
were still posted there i saw them there
66:03
when we went to israel uh just a couple
66:05
years ago
66:06
that's amazing by the way i just
66:08
remembered it's joshua mills is the is
66:10
the name i was trying to remember uh
66:12
joshua mills he's a great great person
66:14
and he sought the
66:16
encounters
66:18
he'll describe how he sought the
66:20
encounters other people like yourself
66:23
you've said i've never sought the
66:24
encounters if i remember right but
66:27
joshua is one of those the reason i kind
66:29
of appreciate that side is because
66:33
um well first of all because i've never
66:35
been
66:35
transported in time so i'm thinking if i
66:38
get permission to at least see the
66:40
encounter maybe i'll do it but anyway
66:44
he tells a story about walking through
66:46
walls and starting to walk through walls
66:48
and it freaked him out
66:50
he pulled back but yeah we have amazing
66:52
times ahead of us amazing feelings well
66:56
i guess that's our time tell uh
66:58
tell folks how they can get a hold of
67:00
your website we've got
67:01
revealingheaven.com on the screen what
67:03
