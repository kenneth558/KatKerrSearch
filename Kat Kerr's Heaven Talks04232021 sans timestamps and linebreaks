thought i would talk a little bit and then maybe jen could come up with some questions because you know we get them all the time either about heaven or something else but um yeah i'm so filled with god right now after doing that interview it was very powerful and so i thought i'd talk some more about the restart of america which is still continuing and i know some places is a little bit slower than others uh we're having really a great response from our governor here in florida so we're really excited about that we're praying for others who aren't really maybe getting the same response from theirs just remember on election day who you vote for next time and i just want to encourage you that that we're hearing more and more things are being reopened and then the reopening is being expanded to like more people able to attend and stuff like that i don't think they're quite ready to do mass crowds meeting together for big events and stuff like that so i'm sure a lot of people are being affected by that i'm sure that that was not easy for any of them and i know many people try different things like drive-by church you know online church was amazing yay dede and david in colorado at um up on lookout mountain they did a great job i think they broadcasted every single night since the quarantine happened they're still doing it and they're still doing it and that would be um gateway on mount zion gateway on mount zion online you can go yeah their facebook page or their website their website in uh yeah gateway on mount zion in golden colorado they're really powerful and i know there were many others who do that i just happen to know that they are one of them and let me tell you god is going to be really be visiting places it was a wonderful thing the day the holy spirit invaded our earth and let me tell you he is my best friend make sure you know him well he will share things with you to come he'll give revelation on the word of god he'll tweak your life all day long and jen and i both know he does that with us he'll even go shopping with you and tell you the best deals to get and honestly i'll even go to get something like i want to pick apples out he'll actually tell me don't get those get these other ones are going to taste better it depends on how much you open yourself up to him you know he's the third member of passing that's what god's been saying is just going to pass on and there will be no second wave he has assured me of that many times so i hope that encourages some people and i know in other countries people really also been praying to god for many things that they need help with and we pray for people all the time to be touched by god to be ministered for resources to come for help to come to different people and you know i know to some people it looks like utterly impossible don't say it's impossible you need to stay with god all things are possible and begin to thank him for the things you need if you've been praying and asking him that's fine but start thanking him for these things it says call those things that be not as though they were that means you talk about them like they're already here that's called faith so i want to encourage everybody i hope your faith has been increased during this time and i know this is something probably most people will never forget of course there'll be generations coming behind us that don't know anything about that but i think this has been a very different time and and hopefully the best part of you has come out during this time don't forget to pray and reach out to others there are many people who we may have less of things but let me tell you there's some that have nothing and my dad's heart was always to help those kind of people we spent years and years helping people feeding them finding them clothes finding them jobs finding houses for them that was just put in me and so that's my heart is to be help people be generous you know and sometimes be generous even when you need something yourself that touches the heart of god when you give out of your own need it really does touch god's heart and i know that right now he's got great things prepared for all of us i just finished saying that in our interview with steve schultz of elijah's i'm going to encourage everyone out there if you are not signed up to elijah list.com you need to go do that because he has the proven prophets you'll hear words from prophets some you know some you don't know and then you can watch and see what god does once they have spoken and declare things he's had me on there several times just discussing things prophesying things god has said and he won't let people come on there if all they want to do is bash and bring doom and gloom and death and destruction this is not the time for that to happen in this earth these are the greater days of god and so i really want to encourage you keep declaring that the restart operation restart will be fully taking place and that people will be able to go back to somewhat of a normal life i hope it's not going to be normal as far as god is concerned i hope you've increased your relationship with your family and with him and then get ready for some awesome things to begin to happen for all of us and that we also pray for people in other countries god i thank you for helping to bring supply to those countries that don't have supply we speak against and take authority over any of the virus right now we won't tolerate the virus even anywhere on the earth in jesus name we are over sickness and disease we are not under it christ was never upset he was never controlled by any form of sickness or disease when he walked down this earth and you shouldn't either he didn't have to put up with lack okay with violence he didn't have to put up with um any forms of oppression or depression he didn't keep in him and he didn't participate with it and make sure you're saying that yourself there's people out there right now if you're oppressed don't tolerate it loose it out of your soul get rid of it don't let it control you don't let fear control you because this is not going to drag on for years and years and why am i saying that because i was in the grocery store the other day and the person just you know just ringing up my my supplies they were saying that their self oh i just think this is going to last for years what are we going to do we don't have any kind of a life and i said well that is not correct this is for a very short time it's going to pass and then your life will begin to increase again so anywhere i can give hope or encouragement to people i'm going to do that that's what we're supposed to do and so thank you for all your prayers and all you guardians i want to thank you so much for your support you have blessed our hearts you've blessed the heart of god every chance i get i'm going to make sure i thank them and we have so many more things coming we have other broadcasts right coming up more programs coming up right now that we're designing and creating so today because we have some extra time in the the studio is all set up we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and answer some questions i think jen has some questions that she can ask me we've been trying to figure out why the internet was sticking so and i do know you know that we've had some issues here techno you know with some of the technical stuff here that i don't understand yeah i don't understand that at all i just know that i know how to talk and so that's my part and we do take authority over and we're not towering the enemy getting in any of our systems frequencies technology whatever it is we're kicking him out in jesus name because i know people are probably out there praying now i'm in agreement with every one of you and so we want to have a great broadcast and a signal to be strong in jesus name so what do you have today jen for a question well i just asked everybody on facebook can i play the intro oh yeah oh we're gonna we're gonna do a short q a so we're gonna let you see our little intro we're gonna so okay we're ready for our q a but before we start i already have a question that i was asked the other day and jen just reminded me people are asking about our 2020 calendar i know the year is almost half over but this isn't just about the months or the days of the months this is about revealing heaven and these calendars we create are what god wants he wants to reveal heaven to the earth the spirit realm to the earth the host of heaven the army of heaven whatever it is he once revealed that's part of our job to reveal heaven to earth and so they want to know about our calendar because we've been talking about it lately there's some fun activities in there that you can do with us that interact with us and one happens to be this month that's how this whole thing started this is the calendar right here i hope you can see it it's called the world called heaven and on the cover is an actual picture of a place that exists in heaven we all know about hebrews 12 1 that talks about the great cloud of witnesses that are watching this from heaven this is one of the places they do that this is called the portal and they have them all over heaven people come in way here this is the doorway walk down here they walk up steps these are steps that go up here to this opening you can see the opening right there and that's where people look down in they can view the earth declare over the loved ones see things happening good things happening on the earth and they sing they go and sing to you on your birthday they they understand they get to see weddings and babies being born and all kinds of things like that so this is a beautiful place that's mentioned in the bible i was taken to that place and so this entire calendar actually that's what this is about and every month you see a place or a being that is in heaven and i'll show you one more and uh but we have special days we put in here we put some of our own days in here what is not in here is satan's holiday you won't see that okay we're not giving him any place whatsoever uh and so let me find one of the other places there's so many i want to show you this is just awesome and most of these places were places i personally was taken to in heaven here's one of somebody going home to heaven this is called the transport and this woman who you can see standing there with the red hair she was 90 in her 90s when she passed and when she stepped her spiritual body stepped out of her body this is what she looked like young and happy she's very happy those are her two guardian angels about to take her home to heaven and then over here you'll find an explanation at the bottom of the picture over here you'll find an explanation of what this picture is about so you you get understanding not just images and then like i said and at the bottom of every month we have a declaration that we make like here this one says heaven celebrates each time a believer comes home so you get this at the end of each calendar month we make a declaration like that for you so it's very exciting you will see places in heaven you never even dreamed were there we do still have some left but the reason people want them is because we have interactive days like we have a day we said uh tell people you know show us with you wearing angel wings and that was one of the days and but you have to use the email email address that is on the calendar for those interactive things we do still have some left so maybe for the next month or so we'll have some so you can find them on revealingheaven.com go to our website click on the store and you'll see this calendar there uh we are already in the in the we are already right now creating to the 2021 calendar and the one before this one which was 2019 was about the host of heaven we we revealed and introduced heaven's army into the earth because the father had asked us to do that and so there's many other things in here i'll show you one more this is called the hall of knowledge i'm not the only one who's been there there's these beautiful towers made out of emerald like they look like emerald glass you ride on roads of light through these towers and that you can learn all kinds of different things the books actually show you the book you would take the book out of the niche and you lay it on this little table and it opens up and shows you like a movie of what's in the book this is heaven this is not the earth so if you're interested make sure you go to revealingheaven.com you can ask for on the web store on the web store and then you can find the world called heaven calendar and they need to click on the correct link that pertains to where they live there's a link for canada there's a link for the us and then there's a link for all other countries because you know we ship internationally around the world and they have different costs for different um for shipping and so that's why it's important you click on the right one so your calendar is not sent to the wrong country and so there you go there's a little bit of information from a question that we got so what do you have next jen um i have a question from eagle eagle and um they asked can our loved ones visit us in our dreams how can our loved ones visit us in our dreams the loved ones from heaven eyes and right yes that happens to many people people have very vivid dreams and i would have to say absolutely that does happen god speaks to people and visions and dreams it says so in the bible so that is possible for you to have a dream or even a vision of your loved one in heaven and actually some people have been caught up to heaven while they were sleeping and didn't realize that and they have very vivid dreams of being in heaven with their loved ones so you know with god those things are possible but absolutely that is possible for that to happen and sometimes it will happen like right after somebody passes away um i've heard of some people just appearing briefly in the room and waving sometimes they don't say anything sometimes they just say i want you know i'm okay or i love you and i think that depends on getting permission from the father for them to get permission from the father to do that i know people are so undone and overwhelmed when they first get to heaven their whole head and heart is just trying to take in that glorious place of splendor in heaven and of course the relationships they have with people they are meeting the father and the son and holy spirit just seeing the beauty that's there the things you prepare for them their own mansion they're just getting undone it's like one gift every time they go somewhere else it's something beautiful but yes i do believe it's possible to have dreams and visions okay um i found this question almost quite well not really humorous so it's it's a good one it's from dawn and she said cat do angels ever mess up like when someone gets in an accident or something is that them maybe not paying attention or slacking off on their job lol just always wondered about that i don't think it's about an angel if an angel messed up it wouldn't be something to do with rescuing somebody or protecting somebody i think so many different circumstances issues in our own lives you know the enemy will try to attack anywhere that he can make sure you're declaring and decreeing against that happening make sure that you're involving the army of heaven in your life um make sure there's all kinds of things so i have to say for sure angels don't mess up on something that would be that important they probably you know you have to realize these are real these beings have real personalities like you and i they all have souls they all have emotions and so i think sometimes maybe they're not quite getting along especially on an assignment i think they would get maybe a harder assignment given to them i do know sometimes that does happen i don't know how often but like i said some people have stronger personalities some have really fun personalities i know that there's some angels that are almost like comedians and there's others who are very focused and fierce against the enemy and that whatever their personality is that that's definitely going to come out in their assignments that god gives them of course they're answerable to him the thing about being an angel is nothing is hidden god definitely knows everything that's going on with them and they live with him so i think he has to handle that stuff and i know um we always have new people that come in or people that haven't heard you talk about stuff and people who've heard you say this stuff a million times but it's like certain people need to hear it and i really feel like um i want to ask this question this is from pam and she said you may have addressed this already please forgive me if it's a redundant i am a nurse you've mentioned we will do the same work in heaven there isn't any sickness or lack in heaven we all that um i know i've done on earth uh let's see what will i do for papa god if my job won't be needed well it's not your job it's not your job that you do in heaven nobody has a job it says actually says you labor no more what you do for a living is not what you'll be doing in heaven unless you've been using the gift he put in you let's say someone who's a recording artist and they're singing and they're so anointed they will be doing that in heaven but they'll be doing it for everybody in heaven for free so it's probably your hobby or something that is your passion uh maybe even though you were a nurse and you took care of people of course there is absolutely no sickness in heaven whatsoever they don't need lawyers doctors nurses there's all kinds of things they just don't need them in heaven because that stuff doesn't exist there but somewhere in you he put a natural gift not a job okay those are skills i'm not talking even about skills skills can be learned but a gift is something he puts in you and that's the thing you love to do the most that's how you can tell what it is it says every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights that would be you and when he made you in your little spirit man he placed in that spirit man a gift whether it is an artist whether it is a dancer whether you're going to sing whether you're going to grow the best flowers ever whether you're gonna make the best i don't know chimichangas uh donuts whatever it is the culinary arts are absolutely i don't know where that came from somebody probably likes them i don't like them whatever whatever okay baker's bakers are loved in heaven because let me tell you he gives you your own shop everything you make it all make all the wonderful stuff there's no gluten free no weight gain i can just go on and on yeah none of this stuff you don't have to have keto you don't have to eat keto stuff at the same time and so they're let me tell you there's fried chicken there's pizza i've been to a pizza parlor and haven't had ice cream cones and everyone that's their gift because that was their passion on the earth and they knew that it says your gifts and your callings are without repentance and he will not take irrevocable means he'll never take it away that means if he put in you to be an artist yes and maybe you never actually had a gallery or anything like that but maybe all you want to do is sketch you're a great sketch artist maybe you you understand colors and stuff like that maybe you want to make pottery with your hands but you don't do that for a living but it's your passion that's your gift it's what your passion is maybe it was a drummer and one grandson he started drumming on everything before he was a year old we knew he was going to be a drummer guess what he still loves it that's his gift when he goes to heaven one day he'll be a drummer that's not a job you don't have to labor it's not something that you don't like it's not something that's hard it's like breathing you love it so much so guess what and all that i do and all that jen does we are photographers my gift is i'm not going to be a revelator in heaven okay i'm not going to be a prophet in heaven i'm not going to be those things i'm not going to be any minister i'm not going to do that i will be a photographer why because i love it it is my passion from the time i was little i'd make fake little cameras with a box and pretend i was taking pictures until i got my first camera and i have never stopped loving it i already know in heaven i'll have a studio come by and see me one day when you get there i'll take your pictures for free and create beautiful stuff out of that so that's what you'll do whatever your hobby is whatever your passion is it's in there somewhere that's what you will be and all your property will be designed that's why there's amusement parks there's rodeos there's all kinds of wonderful fun things there and every time someone comes home to heaven there's something new and exciting to do but they're not working they're not laboring it is the most fun they've ever had in their life so there that's a good answer for those people who don't know they keep sitting on the pew their church this is what god says all my people keep sitting on the pew of their church trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is and yet the thing i want them to know the most is what is their natural gift that i made them when i sent them to the earth because when you get home to heaven that'll be the most exciting thing you do there yep okay one more what's one more okay um i've been screen shotting questions okay um back to uh the when you were talking about the angels um this one person didn't quite understand her her name is i want to say remy home um she said how could they not get along there is no evil in the angels so i guess she does she thinks they fight no no no i'm not talking about fighting like evil there is no evil there is no hate they don't do that in heaven but they have personalities everybody has a personality okay and you have to understand angels are spiritual beings we're physical beings okay we both have a soul but we have to make our we all get to make our own decisions because you're a believer and you're going to heaven doesn't mean you always you don't ever have disagreements with people okay there is no anger no coveting there's no jealousy in heaven there's no wrath nobody fights nobody hits somebody nobody does things spiteful i'm not talking about that kind of stuff i forget sometimes to relate things my answers to heaven culture and not earth culture so your mind is thinking earth culture earth atmosphere earth living it's not like that in heaven but not everybody wants the same thing even in heaven but they still agree to enjoy their self to have fun you still have your favorite things your favorite colors in heaven that god doesn't take all that away from you but there is no anger no wrath no hating no spitefulness no coveting there's no offense that part that part of your your flesh emotions because right now we're spirit man but we still have our flesh when he talks about your flesh lay down your flesh right that's not talking about you dying as a person that's talking about your opinions your rights your attitudes your anger issues that's the flesh that stuff is not there but people still have their personalities their likes or dislikes and sometimes when angels are sent on assignment god on purpose and this is why he does it there's no marriage between the angels they don't get married on this earth we get married and one of the things that he does with marriages sharpens the husband and wife that doesn't mean get you angry enough that you divorce but it stretches us right it makes us to come into agreement on different things sometimes you know we have to give a little take to get you know we have to come together in agreement even as husband and wife but it stretches it says steal sharpen steel that's what happens when you're married you sharpen each other you make each other care more understand things aren't going to be perfect but you're you're willing to work it out in heaven they don't have that so god has another way that the angels get stretched right and he sends different personalities on assignment and i happen to know this is true because two that were assigned to me for a while one was a comedian the other one was so fierce against darkness he wanted to talk about being holy he wanted to talk about crushing the enemy that would be satan his plans the other one wanted to make jokes because he was funny his personality was totally opposite of the southern angels they stretched each other every time they were with me they didn't get angry each other so forget about the anger thing that's earth thinking but angels have personalities in heaven and they like many different things and they have friends amongst each other no romance okay they don't happen in heaven um the angels who fell tried that it didn't work so that's what i'm talking about when i said you know it's not like your flesh getting involved i'm talking about on the earth when you loosen stuff from your soul get grace for that day and you work through your things you don't get offended you don't get in wrath um because we have help from heaven okay one more next question angel question and then i have a question i have a 13 year old um wow melissa wants to know do we have the same guardian angel our whole life yes you have the same guardian angel your entire life at the time you are conceived when life begins life doesn't begin when a baby's born life begins the time of conception and from that moment your angel your guardian angel or angels are sent from heaven they are will you your entire life they are the ones who help bring you home to heaven when your body dies and your spiritual body steps out the first one you will see normally will be your guardian angels and they escort you home in a transport all different ways you can be taken chariots you can be taken to heaven they will be with you the whole time awesome okay um charity's 13 year old daughter her name is i want to say lyanna but she would like to know can we ever get kicked out of heaven no but he's going to get kicked out of heaven that only happened once and that would be satan and all the angels who fell with him they were the only ones who'd been kicked out of heaven all right they decided to go against god to try to take over heaven that was a long time ago and so he was one third of all the angels in heaven how about that that's crazy chose satan chose lucifer as their new leader and they all got kicked out but no one who goes there you're not going to get kicked out of heaven okay when you step out of your physical body with your spiritual body you already whatever things whatever issues you had whether it was anger against somebody or you had issues maybe you didn't even like yourself all that is gone okay those things you don't carry up to heaven the people you cared about the gifts he put in you to use that stuff remains with you and excitement adventure and all kinds of wonderful things are in heaven but you can't get kicked out of heaven because when you receive jesus christ as your savior all the stuff all the sins in you get wiped away like they never happen don't let the enemy remind you of your sins if you repented of them all right now even god can remember them because you told him that you were sorry for them and so i can assure you that no one's going to get kicked out of heaven okay and um this is another one you've answered before but i love to hear you talk about this um erica's brother she didn't say what his name was but he wants to know if there is hunting in heaven this is a fun answer actually that's why i asked it i think you know jen knows a lot because she's heard so many probably she's probably heard every single time i went to heaven and for those of you who don't know me yes god has never stopped catching me up to heaven yes he can do that because he wants to no i don't choose to go myself this is all free for all of you so you understand god caught people up to heaven in the old testament it says so he caught people up to heaven in the new testament without dying and he still does that because he chooses to and so she knows just about every time he caught me up not in this physical body it would stay behind you catch me my spirit man my spiritual body that looked just like me but a lot better and so what was the question erica's brother now if there's hunting in heaven is there hunting in heaven you'd be surprised what god has uh has in heaven but it's the way he does it this different okay almost everything we have on the earth is in heaven except there's no killing no no harm nobody gets injured uh none of that happens in heaven okay so um i'm getting distracted today is there like are you seeing angels well there are angels all over in here right now okay of course i could get distracted just by the one that's behind me and the one who's two on here the one standing by you the one standing by chris okay the one's sticking their heads with the ceiling looking down and the ones looking through i'm gonna figure oh yes because you know i don't really want to hunt maybe well no we won't say that i don't hunt i don't want to hurt anything maybe mosquitoes there's hunting in heaven but this is the way god does it because nothing gets killed remember what i said no creatures are killed all animals are called creatures in heaven they all talk they all have actually uh amazing personalities but you do go to the mountain of spices that actually exist in heaven and what you do is a camera shoot you're capturing the image and they actually have a clubhouse in this whole place and you will be hunted by the creatures with their own cameras while you're hunting them and your goal when you get to heaven is to be the first one to get their picture which is sent back to this huge clubhouse with like a 40-50 foot screen and down in the corner is the one who captured you and on the screen is the one that was captured and so all these people i actually saw people in heaven doing that they had you know pack horses and they were packing all their camera equipment on these horses they even have different type cameras that look like sort of like a scope thing and when you some of these creatures are not anywhere on the earth by the way so you're really hunting something that's fantastic but more times than not when you get back to the clubhouse you will see your face plastered all over the big screen and in the corner will be the creature who captured you by getting that picture first so it's very intense because while you're hunting to find the creatures to get their pictures it's a camera shoot remember you're not gonna hurt anything but how intense is that hunting process when you're looking for something that's never been seen before and yet they're probably smarter than you they hide to you and they get you first when you go back thinking wow i know i snapped that picture and you walk in the clubhouse and there's your face plastered all over you know that you were busted and you were caught not them but the intensity and excitement even increases more so in heaven but nobody gets hurt or harmed and no life is taken so you will still get to do that try your best if you can when you get there okay i have a um another question you've talked about before but um holy spirit really wants me to ask this so um do aborted babies and babies in general have their own mansions especially when they grow up or if not where do they live i brought this everybody everyone no matter who they are will eventually have their own mansion jesus said in my father's house that's a world by the way just you understand god's house is the world called heaven bigger than our galaxy and uh trust me there's plenty of room for mansions and when little babies go home to having every baby who dies passes leaves this earth with however you want to say it whether through abortion miscarriage or because they were sick or whatever if when they die and they go home to heaven they will know family members in heaven uh they will grow very slowly uh we've actually know of people who when they were 40 years old died on the operating table saw their seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold who died years before that but because they the the mother went in her spiritual body her son recognized him he still looked seven years old he was playing with friends on the streets of gold and he recognized her and actually told her you can't stay you have to go back but god allowed her to see her son number one he was well and whole he was happy he was playing he had friends and his mom came back of course she survived her operation and for years her and her husband would travel around the world and tell people about the beauty and the love of god that their child was still waiting on them in heaven now she's already home in heaven so when the parent comes home to the baby they actually get to take the baby from the nurseries and i have a picture here's one of the nursery walls that i saw in heaven right here and i gotta make sure that the lights not reflecting tilt it down oh here yeah there we go that's good if you can see that these are some of the babies beds that were on this nursery wall i saw now they weren't sleeping babies don't have to sleep in heaven but they have these beautiful like a little niche these are little tiny babies most of them and the angels give them a nickname unless the parents have named them and they grow so slowly birds come in and the birds take them for rides around heaven all kinds of fun things for them to do they can sing laugh dance and god has this beautiful place for them and they will be there until either the grandparents come home or somebody close to that baby in relation they get to take them and keep them to the parents get there the parents take turns raising them and eventually they grow they step into the gift remember we talked about gifts they each have a gift whether it could be anything designing um it could be like music it could be art it could be dance it could be culinary arts it could be creating all kinds of gifts and things for people making things out of gems i know they have jewelers and things in heaven whatever their natural gift is they'll still use that in heaven they'll step into their gift and eventually they will have their own mansion when we come home to heaven we come home as god's son or daughter and all those babies will be growing in the most beautiful amazing place loved by jesus himself and fun places that he made for them so your babies know who you are they definitely can't wait for you to get to heaven so that was beautiful you brought that jen okay um this question is from jan vincent and he wants to know if you can practice christianity and witchcraft no and what if you you cannot claims that he pray for people and heal people with jesus name but yet also do witchcraft stuff i will tell you what the bible says there'll be some people who go there one day and jesus will say depart from me i never knew you you cannot practice evil and say you are a believer too you cannot do both when you become when you practice witchcraft you're partnering with satan even the bible talks about that it was called necromancing in the bible and it's all evil it belongs to satan witchcraft controls and i know that one day they'll actually be people that are called themselves good witches there is no good witch and i've heard from some of them myself and let me tell you when you partner with satan he will lie to you deceive you but you cannot you have to choose one or the other because christianity you believe in jesus christ as your savior he does not tolerate witchcraft he never practiced witchcraft he spoke against witchcraft even himself in the new testament so it's wrong it belongs to the enemy and this is a thing people will get healed in the name of jesus it's jesus's name healing them but that doesn't mean they get reward for that and the bible says will be people who come before god there's also people who say they're a christian but they sin in bad ways they sin but they go hold meetings people get saved they'll get healed they may get words from god because that doesn't stop operating you the way you choose your own life to live and what you personally choose yourself will be demonstrated by the way you live your life that means you can't be a witch and you can't belong to jesus you have to choose okay because when you die whoever owns you or you serve will come to get you and if you're practicing witchcraft that gives the enemy the right to come and get you when you die so i would not mess around with that get witchcraft out of your life i pray for people to be delivered from witchcraft spirits that doesn't come from god so don't play around don't read books on witchcraft don't go see movies about witchcraft you're opening a door in your soul for the enemy to begin to control you and these people who think they can be do both are under a great deception so i'm just saying there's evil people people who are doing wrong sinning but going and having meetings people come they get saved by the name of jesus they get healed by the name of jesus they get worse because the holy spirit is going to speak to those people it isn't that person okay don't follow people who you know are sinning don't do it because you follow jesus christ those who believe the word of god and live the word of god there's double accountability for leaders and so he will hold them doubly accountable but it says one day when they come before him and want the reward there will not only be no reward he will not allow them to remain okay so you can't you can't do evil and do god you have to choose god you cannot have evil in your life and witchcraft is one of those satanism is witchcraft any false religion don't try to practice two religions at the same time any witchcraft and you don't allow it in you make sure you're running your race to make a difference for jesus christ it says for us to be like him he didn't practice any of that he actually spoke against it so those people are deceived there you go okay um this one's really long but i'm not going to read the whole entire thing and uh again you have discussed this but um this is from charity um herself and she says she has such a struggle with being you know you can share on this experience i can share on this i absolutely can share on this and number one i want to let you know this god does not approve of any violence no abuse okay no kind of abuse whatsoever whether it's physical abuse verbal abuse god is against that and and let me tell you this that he would rather you be by yourself than be with someone who's abusing you i know that many spiritual leaders through the years have said uh and it can happen on both sides okay i'm not saying i know women that were violence and abuse their husbands and i know men that were violent and abused their wives it happened on both sides so you can't say one is worse than the other abuse is abuse okay uh but for instance let's just say for instance i had prayed for people before they were under severe abuse and this was a wife and she was abused physically all the time and when she went to her pastor they would say you cannot leave your husband the bible says you cannot do that no that was not the right thing to say to them okay god does not put up with abuse he doesn't approve of anybody abusing anybody you certainly have the right to not be abused and this is the thing if it is sin let's just say it's sin if we say it sin sins can be forgiven if you divorced and it wasn't out of abuse when you just divorced you didn't want that person you you divorced them you can go before god and say i repent of that that doesn't mean you have to go back to the person you're already divorced your pen is wiped away sin is wiped away people you can't hold those sins against people not even things they did 30 years ago if they repented of those things then god doesn't remember them anymore and i happen to know myself personally some people don't like me after i tell them this i went out and picked out somebody it wasn't god's choice this is what the bible says and god came to me himself one day and i was abused horribly uh when i was married to somebody else and god came to me and said how long are you going to put up with that and i said well what should i do about it he said you have a contract you don't have a covenant he said my word says what god has joined together let not man put asunder what that means is don't let man end it he said if if god put it together if it was god who brought you together and then again even if you did and you repented for doing that later it's still forgiven okay people don't like it when i say that sin is sin if you repent it's forgiven no matter what kind of sin that is it's it says that he remembers it no more he's not going to treat you like a lower human being okay god's not going to do that i'm still pursuing my destiny i repented of that and uh god said end the contract so we i got divorced because god told me to he said you'll never be who i need you to be if you remain married to that person i didn't bring you that person that is not my choice that's not a covenant a covenant is when i bring you together i didn't look for anyone god brought me the husband i have now we've been married 43 years and let me tell you a marriage is a trial it's a trial it's a challenge because you've got two individuals coming together as one maybe you like different things you do things different ways make sure that you're marrying the person god has for you and even then there could be conflict but make sure you're praying for each other i'm just going to include all this in this package that's not just a yes or no thing now yes or no abuse is as bad as running around on your spouse it's still abuse that is mental abuse if you're married and you go find someone else and sleep with them and you you choose them over your spouse and you're still married and all this is going on that is sin that is for sure sin but it's abuse god puts abuse in that same line that says that talks about adultery in that home meaning is severe abuse and that's what he recognizes even in the bible that you can be divorced if that happens this is a very touchy question but i don't mind answering it okay i suffered a lot of abuse but put up with it for six and a half years until i finally said to god what do i do and he said how long are you going to tolerate it i had to repent to the person i married i didn't even love them i had to repent to them i'd repent for them that that had to be ended because god had asked me to end it so there was repentance on my side and then god brought me the right person and i married them because he said you will marry this person so people can fight and argue and yell all you want to it's about what you repent from if it was wrong what you did it's been ended and it's over and maybe the other person is remarried he certainly doesn't expect you to go after them and make them remarry you you repent for the whole situation give yourself to god and he probably most more than likely will bring you somebody else to be with you god doesn't want us to be alone okay and the reason why he has marriage is so we don't have to go through this life alone it says the marriage bed that means you know what that means that means a living together having physical relations when you're married god approves of that when you're not married and you live together and do that he does not approve of that and there's many reasons why because when you come together you're actually sharing your soul with each other this is more than you ever thought you were going to get this is what happens when you ask the deep questions okay and the more of yourself you give when you're married you're empowering each other but when you're not married and you're sharing physical relations with each other you're giving parts of your soul away layers that you shouldn't be doing that to someone you're not married to so there's your whole story it's all about abiding in god married they're christians and they marry someone who's not it's a much harder lifestyle if they don't want to agree with what you're doing maybe make sure you find that up before you get married but i can tell you that if anyone repents they are forgiven and you can't drag that stuff up and throw it back in their face again because what you that is then wrong okay you have to forgive too even it was something that was done to you that that unforgiveness will hurt you worse than what you experienced before in your life get rid of all unforgiveness and all offense no matter what it was and you run your race and let god bless you and so there's that very long answer about that question but god doesn't tolerate abuse in any marriage no physical abuse no mental or emotional abuse that beats you up until you feel like you're nothing at all he doesn't want you to stay in a situation like that okay he doesn't and so uh pray let god open doors of safety for you and you seek him to see what you're supposed to do next but he does love you there you go so um somebody actually asked me a question oh wow jen what did they ask you they wanted to know if i've ever been to heaven okay so come over here and say thank me if they ask you then you give them their answer hey i'm kind of in my gym clothes still it's okay everybody looks like that right now anyway so i've never been to heaven but i have had um three open visions uh during the time that i was writing the the first children's book and well two times were with the first children's book and then the third time was during the well well i've been writing the second but he did something special for you didn't he yes um when i was writing the first book i wrote one sentence down and i was in my office and my whole office went black and then my wall kind of opened up like a movie screen and i it was like i was seeing the book come alive so it was all in cartoon form every time i've ever had an open vision about heaven it's been in cartoon form that's cool and so i was seeing the characters in the book and walking down the streets of gold and um one of the times that that happened they were going into the amusement park which kat talks about in her first book and i was seeing all kinds of things um and things that i had never heard her talk about and so it was like i was walking with them i didn't see myself on the path but i knew i was walking with them seeing my characters walking down the streets of gold and going into the amusement park and one of the things that really fascinated me which is going to be in the first kids book is i saw a merry-go-round and instead of uh the horses that you sit on there are actual live animals and they were whole the the people children adults and there were even some animals writing on there so it looks like animals it was quite funny um but they were riding on the backs and they had rains and then instead of their little platform yeah instead of a pole being down the middle um they were on a platform that would go up and down and i had never heard her talk about i didn't know that and so i was so excited it went in when the vision was over i come running out of my office to tell her what i saw and and she's like yeah that's up there so um and there were other things that i saw too and what what were some of the well or some of the animals you could write on jen not what you would think yes it is was um dinosaurs there was even a whale so apparently somebody had always wanted to ride a whale i mean i guess it it wasn't huge so it shrunk down to fit on the merry-go-round but there was a seahorse that didn't need water to breathe no it didn't it didn't and there was uh jungle animals uh you know like elephants and lions and real ones yeah real ones breathing ones and it was really cool and uh there was like a little raccoon that was on the back of i think it was like a hippo or something it was so funny but um yeah and they like lollipops don't they yes the raccoons like yeah yeah because they even saw a raccoon riding on the rush yeah so that that was my experience and it was it's happened three times now yeah and uh so yeah that'd be awesome yeah yeah that was a great answer i'm back over here now okay maybe a couple more questions so that we can we do have a couple more things i have to do today but how much fun is this to just have a just a spontaneous q a session and now you find out some people can see heaven and cartoon form that would be really cool so oh let's see and so when you see like you know teal squirrels or or purple elephants yes that exists in heaven everything is different colors in heaven i love when you talk about the messenger squirrels yes that we're talking the greeters the breeders i've always called a messenger squirrels they're greeters they sing and dance with top hats the squirrels when you have a party somewhere in your home yes people have parties and they come to entertain and they have top hats and canes and some of the best dancers i've ever seen and you you you just you know get home and say hey we're having a party we'd like for you to come do some some of your performance you never know what's going to happen up there it's just great so what would you say to someone who's been praying and asking to see jesus and angels and it hasn't happened yet i would say um stop praying and asking and start thanking him i'm real serious about that because it happens at the most unexpected times and it's usually not when you're asking i'm just gonna give you a free little tip and many times it's not when you're praying either most of my encounters i have in heaven is not when i'm praying somewhere i'm not even reading my bible i'm doing everyday stuff and he catches me up and sometimes i'm doing everyday stuff and then an angel walk up walk up and say something or i'll see them doing things or um so you have to just understand you think if you don't get in some spiritual position of what you think would be proper then it's not going to happen jesus also visits me when i least expect it and so i would just say expect have an expectancy that is going to happen you know and i you know maybe share to people i'm expecting this to happen and you'd be surprised how soon or quickly it happens then well i know the first time i saw an angel which was um um the one that was watching uh ben do the shipping and receiving yeah we've seen i was working at my desk typing right here in this room and at the core of my eye i just see this most radical looking angel leaning he's just like like this watching him pack up the products to ship out and i was like okay and i just kept on typing you know what even the angels love it that we're sharing heaven and all of our products represent something about heaven or living righteously or being dangerous against hell all of the products we put up for that reason and we we do have mp3s now we have dvds cds mp3s we have photographs we have artwork now we have calendars we have cups we have all kinds of stuff we're creating um to to demonstrate and manifest heaven like here's one of the cups right here i have one it says i don't do demons and there's a little lightning bolt representing when they were all kicked out of heaven you know then once you follow loose for that's what that lightning bolt represents some hell doesn't like it that we market stuff like this because it points fingers at them anyway so we do all kinds of things so angels are going to be present even if you don't see them they're present if you're speaking on behalf of god when you're praying they're there your angels always there maybe turn around every now and then say thank you for watching over me that's perfectly okay you're not sitting down having tea with them however if god allows it enjoy it we're living in a different life and time now and i know that before the end does come which is generations away it will be normal for you to see angels in your home and angels in your car outside your car because they're there all the time i see them and i know more and more the spiritual realm and these are spiritual beings in the spirit realm the spirit realm will be more and more visible in our lives so you live in a great time okay you live in a great time and great things are about to happen in this earth even in the midst of everything else god has his plans and so i would just encourage you we'll probably take one more question and that will be it for today and you never know when we're going to show back up again yes i i hope that you're enjoying this time with us and uh even though it was unplanned i love spontaneous spontaneous still happens in heaven okay okay and so uh well we'll let jen um okay share one more question um okay this might take a while but i know we've discussed this before that's okay someone wants to know i don't i don't didn't see who asked the question but someone wants to know is the virus the mark of the beast or the the vaccine the vaccine it's the mark of the beast uh we we've had this long conversation about this everything is many years something comes up that is the mark of the beast yes and i have lived along with you and let me tell you they were doing it back in the 50s oh i was alive oh even mom it my our mom who was born in the 30s she was born in the 30s they said even back then they were saying that the rapture was coming the rapture was coming you know you know what he says about all that just so you know revelation 21 the very end of the bible okay the very end of the bible there's so much still that has to happen the best of things other than christ being born him dying on the cross tearing up hell wasting hell okay those were amazing powerful things the holy spirit coming those were great times but we're entering into some of the most powerful exciting times as a believer that's your life that's the what you what's coming for your life okay but i can tell you the mark of the beast is nowhere right now there's nothing that's been created on the earth that is the mark of the beast at all in any way whatsoever it isn't the michael chip oh no they used to say the bar code okay when i was going to the barcode you're going to walk around with a bar called this big on your head right that was going to be the mark of the beast this is the crazy thing i will say this the mark a mark is a visible mark you will see it a visible permanent mark you will see it with your eyes it's not something hidden in your skin it's not something that will happen or a frequency that will be around no it's not the 5g it's not 5g people this is what god said about 5g that just means the gospel will go further and stronger than ever before around the world around the world which is his purpose so don't look for the 5g to be the mark of the beast that can't even happen okay the antichrist is not on the earth the spirit or the attitude or the nature antichrist means anything that's against christ himself anything that speaks truth and hope is and then that is the that is the truth but anything that speaks against it is an antichrist spirit jesus said even now the antichrist spirit is in the earth he didn't mean the person he met the way it will operate he will speak against god the antichrist will be against jesus christ his holiness his sovereignty it will speak totally against all of that that that stuff is going on but the antichrist himself has not been born how about that one people he's not on the earth because he couldn't operate in his fullness with the body of christ taking authority over the earth ruling and reigning on christ uh changing things speaking to things it wouldn't be able to be here he couldn't be here in the time when the antichrist comes the whole world will be falling apart millions of people will be missing off of the earth it will be a horrible experience for people and he will be their their protector he will be their savior the antichrist will have answers for all that stuff he's not here that stuff is not happening so no the mark of the beast is not out here somewhere but it will be a permanent visible mark and satan will make sure people want to take it back in the days of that happening and you will see it walking down the street he can't force you to take it people because it would defeat his purpose his purpose he wants to flaunt that people want him and they they want him to be there so this is not the time for any of that it's not the time of the four horses of the apocalypse it's not the time for the wormwood whatever to hit the earth it isn't time for death and destruction it isn't it is the time for the the knowledge and understanding and the operation of the glory the power of god seen going around the earth in these days there's baptism in fire that will burn all the fear out of you all the world out of you okay that has not happened yet okay the manifested sons and daughters speaking to earthquakes to make them stop and put it back the way it was before it happened or anybody died that's a manifested son or daughter raising the dead that were cremated that's a manifested son or daughter are you seeing that it's not even happening but we have to have this in the earth because she said it would be here and the wealth of the will the wealth of the wicked has to be transferred to the just and the righteous those things haven't even started stop asking if the mark of the beast is out there stop asking if this is the end and everything's going to crash and just be blown away it isn't and i have news for you the earth won't even stop being here until after the tribulation is over and it's done and gone they'll still be natural people on the earth jesus christ will sit on the throne in jerusalem for one thousand years when all of that is done and gone many of us will be in heaven okay and then the earth then jesus will be king of the world for one thousand years will be no wars no weapons will even be used saint will be in the bottomless pit just falling he will not even be on the earth there'll be no evil on the earth at the time there'll be people who don't want christ on the earth so you can see that even at the end of this age we're in which is still got quite a few generations to it the next age after this age will be the millennial age so the earth will still be here it'll still be operating it says people will still be getting married and being given a marriage so don't try to make god's will be pushed into a little box of what people have told you it will be this is not the last day this is not the perilous times where you can't build you can't eat there won't be anything to do you'll barely be able to breathe you won't see blue sky you won't even be here during that time you are here during some of the greatest days on the earth and i'm just going to end with this because it is so powerful to understand god's timing he has things in his own word he wrote if they're still in some of the newer bibles i hope they leave them in there the perilous times have not happened the tribulation has not happened it will not happen for quite a long time your focus is to know christ to have an intimate relationship to speak hope life create things invent things give people hope for a future not demon gloom okay god himself the father is the only one who decides when jesus comes back and he is too busy ruling and reigning with us okay so look for greatness look for god's plan for your life run after it don't sit him on the curb somewhere make sure he stays with you no holy spirit and know that you are chosen to be here now you are not chosen for wrath we as the body of christ have not been appointed unto wrath so we won't be here there will be people saved during the times of the tribulation those are other people who were not christians before that happened okay you focus on what he wants right now which is he wants you to be great for him in the earth bring hope and life watch your words watch your choices but live happy make sure you have fun because heaven is half fun and half powerful it's so filled with splendor glory and awe of god fun as a weapon against fun is a weapon when you're having fun the enemy doesn't like it so make sure you're using confusion too yes it confuses his head because he can't understand why he's not keeping you crushed down all right run after god himself and let god take care of all the rest of that stuff don't look for the mark of the beast it's not going to come in the letter it's not going to come in an email nobody can send it to you nobody can put it on you they can't force you to take it so you're not even in the generation that will be a part of that that means you are here to do powerful amazing things with him let your faith build trust god regardless of what's going on yes i've been through hard things before my life but i trusted him even when i had nothing i trusted him and believed his word and i told him i did bless his heart bless your angels heart by declaring the things of god it'll change the atmosphere where you live choose god choose life be powerful in the earth for him and we will see you later right jen [Music] yep [Music] you

for the heavens to be ripped open come on amen absolutely and uh you know well we love you we're going to be with you this weekend and so we're going to talk about this conference the washington glory major very soon so i'm so glad you're here on the show and and miss catker no introductions needed a one and only how are you doing ma'am welcome welcome i'm in a constant state of excitement right now that's what i'm doing i'm i'm feeling exactly what they're feeling in heaven they're excited about right now and what god's doing right now uh will touch and change this world for the next 100 years you know i'm just going to throw it out there because that's what the father does with me i can just tell you this is very key very important a lot of people maybe get trapped on the side about you know maybe violence or this going on but i can tell you god's got his plan and he's going to work it and it's going to be amazing and i just want to add this about the northwest did you not know the places that are the most significant to god are the ones that are attacked the most by the enemy and that's why satan wants to keep that area dry because it is like a wellspring i'm not just a well but a wellspring and i'm telling you god is going to explode from that area and come from that very corner of uh this country and flood all over the place so just stay excited everybody and don't miss it don't miss this event that's gonna happen wow that's powerful because uh you know you're talking about wellsprings and really i want to talk right now about the wellsprings of revival i believe we are in a season where god is re-digging or digging up the old wells like in the days of isaac yeah and he's also digging up new wells the old wells and the new wells and of course right now we're in the month of february it's it's my favorite uh month of the year why because it's my birthday month so welcome to february everybody but of course in this month uh catherine coleman passed uh billy graham pass john paul jackson bob jones and paul kane so i really feel like kat and sherelle did this season god wants us to dig up the old wells and the new whales of revival in america because we're in a new season now i want to ask you miss cat what do you think about that word and what god's doing and digging up the old wells and the new wells right now well i do know this that he's definitely in a generational thing right now which means the generations of the past and everything that they did and made as a foundation is going to explode in this in the generations of this uh time on the earth and those who are alive on the earth it's going to really it's going to accelerate everybody forward and upward and so yes i definitely agree with that the things that the people lay down their lives for i love it that in the month of love you know god took all those mighty men and women home and i actually knew bob jones would go home the father told me the birth of february and taking bob home on the 14th and he said it's going to open up whole new portals whole new gates all over this nation and he said so everybody needs to be excited and you know but that was several years ago but that doesn't matter god builds on things he knew everything that would happen and yet he's still gonna do everything he wants but this is what we'll have at the end we will have great victory and great celebration come on absolutely and i'm just being reminded miss cats of again bob jones prophetic word when the kansas city chiefs win the super bowl it will be a sign of world revival of the end times billions of harvests and of course last year the kansas city chiefs won after a long hiatus and it was a sign of course column drum you know uh you know with the dates and the coach and all of that but right now the kansas city chiefs are in the super bowl another time for the second consecutive year in a row awesome and i feel like again this is a double double sign double for your trouble sign that god is raising up the apostolic chiefs in america right now yeah you know and again i just love what you said miss cat that that mantle of the prophetic and of love of bob jones and of the kansas city prophets it's really coming down right now so strong yeah um wow my gosh and i i just want you miss cat if you could just pray into that right now in this moment because february is a month of love like you said but it's a month of mantles and a prophetic glory invasion can you just pray one thing one more second um the double thing totally goes into all of this because god started talking to me about the double uh divine decade divine decade uh and there's a double there's the 20 20 to 30 and the 30 to 40. this is going to stretch that long in this in this on this earth a lot here in america but god i thank you father for having your will your way this day that we're going to just skyrocket in this month of february god that people will see your love in our lives but also the true prophetic follow those with the true prophetic word god will step forward they may some be unknown some known but i know this is your time in the earth for for people to know you and to hear your word your true word which will excite people it will not be human gloom at all it's going to be your power your love your way in this earth and so by the way thank you for that and we come against anything of the enemy that would interfere or stop or halt or delay any of that in jesus name we say no more we command the host of heaven to go ahead and pull down every stronghold of satan trying to stop anything in this event keeping anyone from being a part of it we declare your power be seen and heard in this earth through the mouth of your prophets god we thank you for the mantles to be awakened god and those even carrying them to be brought alive in this time i thank you this is your time on the earth and we agree with your plan wow amen and amen absolutely i i feel like right now because of where our conversation's going i feel like we need to talk about what is god doing in this month of february what is god going to do in our country and in the nations of the earth that i just feel such an expectation and an anticipation because february is going to be a mega month of miracles so let's talk about that right now and i want to pass to mike in the florida prophetess sherelle what do you what do you sense what do you expect god to do in this month of february in this season right now well it's it just blew my mind that as soon as you guys got on here you started talking about the wells of revival i don't know if you guys know about a prophetess named fuchsia pickett but she was a prophetess back here in the 70s i believe and she i was reading some of her book last night and she was talking about how wellsprings of revival were going to burst up in certain areas of this uh of washington and this area over here and so i began to see a vision when i was reading that and i saw the lord show me that there's been like holes of revival in the grounds of the earth here and some people have sown seeds of faith and they've prayed and they've prepared the way and revival has come up to the surface a couple times but man put his foot on the coals man tried to stop the move of the holy spirit and what the lord is saying to me about these next few months is that we are going to be led by the spirit the spirit is going to lead us man is no longer going to lead the spirit and it's i'm i'm excited i just feel like the holy spirit what the lord showed me in 2017 he told me that the holy spirit will be given a platform and that's what we're seeing in this season a place that is cultivating revival by letting the holy spirit lead amen and you know just uh just to piggyback on that you know really the next three months i want you to hear these words because the next three months there's going to be monumental momentum that's going to take place from now passover i wish somebody heard me today from today february 1 to passover which is of course in the middle of april for the next three months there's going to be mega momentum monumental momentum that's going to shift you into harvest and into miracles so there's going to be a lot of setup for financial miracles miracles in your business and even salvation in your family but from now to passover begin to prepare because there's going to be mega setups for your divine breakthrough now before i pass the mic over uh to the woman of god cancur i just want to read the scripture because we're talking about whales because i believe god is springing up wells right now in the spirit genesis 26 18 isaac reopened someone said reopened which means it was closed but he opened up again isaac reopened the wells that had been dug up in the time of his father abraham which the philistines ding ding ding key were philistines which are enemy opposing giants the giants of the land the giants of welfare of poverty of socialism the giants of human trafficking of the elitist the philistines had stopped the whales after abraham died and so right now these giants of the land of 201 are trying to stop the wells or stop the flow of your finances stop the flow of the holy spirit stop the flow of revival but god wants to anoint you to dig up and open up again what has been closed by these philistines these opposing giants and god's going to be doing it from today february 1st all the way to passover so you watch god's about to open up miss cat what are your thoughts here what do you want to say to the people right now i i have to say exactly what the father is continually saying to me don't we don't lose that um that spirit of celebration and maybe you don't know this people but celebrating in heaven is mainly what they do it's one of the ways they worship god it's one of the ways they are are thankful and grateful to him for all the things that they that he did for us while we were on earth and also once they get to heaven and so they are celebrating in heaven already and i do know another prophet uh hank kuhneman who always talks about january february and march that leads into april and he is almost in line with what you're saying he says that january will begin to bring justice february will be all the fireworks of the beginning of everything happening and then marching into the end of the march will be great celebration and miraculous so uh that's what he has heard from god i can tell you that i continually hear that justice is already beginning to be served and all the stuff that's going on and just let me add what the father just shared with me yesterday about all the stuff going on we know that those who are now sitting in seats of authority are illegitimate that's what the father says is illegitimate power in other words not power given in the natural not power given in the spirit you know the whoever is the head of a government it says that when the righteous are in power the people rejoice but when it's the wicked and the evil are that great the sadness comes upon them well i need to remind everybody that right now those who are in authority don't have power not real power which will be shown and proven when that great victory comes and god will shift back what his intentions always were and the truth is this the one who is in true authority even right now yeah which is trump he is actually a president he did win the election and he is the one in authority still welcoming god still having plans by the way he's still getting ready to work plans i just have to let you all know that and it's beginning to be no secret that that's happening so there's a lot of people right now in dc very afraid demons are leaving dc like crazy i mean they're just leaving racing out of there and this is what god said that is because it's illegitimate power so those who are righteous right now they are still in power they're the ones in power and what he says what our president says the true president says is what will affect this cup this country not just in the natural but in the spirit realm this is what the father says the wicked and evil trying to rule they have no power no true power so they have no right no portals open to them to allow evil to flood this country like people think is happening i'm sorry but the devil isn't going to be taking over because there's no true portal or opening you have for that to happen that is shut you should be rejoicing everybody because this is going to be an accelerated thing that begins to happen with the revival going into the habitation of god in this in this country and all over the world actually so these are celebrator times these are victorious times these are not times to be crushed and to be sad and to have fear in you about the only thing the devil's getting away with is bringing fear all those regulations and all those laws being made illegal illegitimately will not stand yes well this is why you should be celebrating because we will have the ability to move unhindered all open country as god moves and does the victory thing and you will see it with your eyes everybody will see it with your eyes this is why it's so important to come to these events right now to get filled up to get excited to begin to make plans with god himself about what your part will be in this so this is a strategic event you don't want to miss this this event because this is god's time to bring in that double decade the divine decades uh back to back in this in this country here and it's going to be so powerful your life won't be the same we don't want it to go back exactly the way it was we want it to be greater more powerful in god that we will be more accelerated forward and the law will flow in this country especially between the body of crisis was really needed first and i declared that that love will be released because the other can't be hell can't be released right now people if you get me in the spirit room if you were a or you would understand it's leaving hell is leaving and so that leaves those who want to be in power power less they won't have the effects they won't have the enticement they won't have that uh the captivation of hell and evil although it's already in them it will not be released or lose throughout this land because there's been no portals open because the one in true authority is not allowing it come on that's so good and of course the wells are actually portals because wells one more thing there are these massive angels some of the hosts have already been sent to some of these wells and they have these swords probably they're 15 feet high swords and they're like standing there like this over them about to hit them when we declare something at this event they will hit these wells these drywalls and they will literally be open and they'll shoot on springs so this is a specific event planned by god so this can happen so don't miss being a part of uh having those wells open can i share something with you really quick uh that's what i was seeing in the spirit when i was beginning to pray and see you coming over to this area i saw you just taking a stake and driving it into the ground and it just broke open this area and i saw the wells begin to bubble up and the the springs just begin to spring forth throughout the earth in this area and it just goes all the way from this side all the way down into the east coast and i just believe it's going to start something here in this area that has not been done before i'm so we are so excited well absolutely the convergence that happens when the right anointings and mantles come together and and times uh you do not receive a breakthrough because there's an element that's missing but i believe again us coming together especially with miss cat especially with the now anointing and the now word that she carries sun is gonna break open in the pacific northwest so listen people of god you need to be there at this event i mean we're pretty much sold out i don't know if we can do overflow open up the doors and have people just sitting outside we may have to do that honestly because we're already sold out uh but you know there's going to be something powerful that's going to be released that's going to affect all the regions of states nearby i guarantee it i believe witches are going to come to jesus yeah people who are in new age are going to be delivered okay to warlocks weekends people moving in the dark and black magic and dark spirits they're they're going to feel the tremors of the wealth opening up so it's going to be powerful um you know again as we're talking about all this again what god is doing in america right now on the earth what god is doing from now february all the way to april passover and now specifically for this conference this event the washington glory invasion you know i'm just reminded of again uh uh john g lake how he started up the healing whales and the healing rooms in spokane washington and you know there's something supernatural that happens in the pacific northwest and i believe something's going to break with that mantle now prophet shirelle is there something you want to share with us concerning john g lake the healing rooms and that well of revival that's about to burst open i just know that we are getting close we have been seeing more miracles than ever before in our second service we had a man come in and walk out of a wheelchair i mean when taylor ran up to me and she was like mom there's someone outside in a wheelchair and i was going oh my gosh not a wheelchair on my second service but it was incredible it's just awesome to be pioneering here what has been in god's heart for so long and i just what i'm seeing is that this explosion that's gonna happen no man can keep his foot on it then the holy spirit is getting ready to explode in this area i believe we're going to see miracles like never before i believe we're going to see limbs growing out more blind eyes and deaf ears being healed but not only that families being healed god is calling whole families in this season he's calling the prodigals home and i'm so excited to see and be a part of this movement and it's like god is strategically placing people the right people together people that probably really never wanted to do anything like this i don't know about you cat but i was just minding my own business when the fire of god fell on me in my living room and he told me to go live on facebook and i was like you want me to do what so i just believe that god is raising up a remnant in this season in this hour he's the people that he's bringing to the hub here are just so hungry and they're tired of church they're tired of religion they're tired of being put in a box i took the box slacks last week and i ripped it in half and i threw it and i stomped on it during the circuit because i just believe you know when we're led by the holy spirit it's powerful yes it is we give him the platform and he does it all it takes the pressure off of us and we just give him the reigns and we say have your way holy spirit and i believe that's people like john g lakes that's what he did he probably surrendered his life to the holy spirit and that's why god used him so mightily and that's what we're seeing right now and another thing is i feel like you know um god's using the most unlikely people yeah and people that are not really that well liked people don't like cats pink hair people don't like my pink lipstick but i'm just being obedient to god and just saying use me lord i surrender my life to you and he's gonna he's gonna do something in this area that we have not seen we are getting ready to see something that we have never seen i mean what are the odds of the kansas city chiefs going to the super bowl for a second time yeah that's incredible well well once again god god is the god of the miraculous and he's the god of the double and the triple so i believe in the season just like prophet shirelle said that the unlikely the no names the faceless those that objected looked down upon i mean president donald j trump took took it by storm and he came totally from left uh from the left side from you know left wing but again it's those types of people where there will be a supernatural grace to be an apostolic chief like the kansas city chiefs god's raising of apostolic chiefs prophetic warriors in the season who carry the now word of god and who walk in signs and wonders yeah uh of course we're talking about this event uh you know we're all going to be together literally in a few days i know my cities uh talk to us what are you expecting for this event it's really not even an event but it's it's a family celebration it is because it's actually an encounter um yes god doesn't always call things events anymore he calls them encounters and those who are there or who choose to encounter what he's got those are the ones who will go away with it to use it to release it for him but something else about john g lake um i remember one time when i was i was under attack that was probably maybe 12 14 years ago when all that happened and i was heading to memphis to um release elvis's mantle to be completed because it wasn't completed and then he bought me every way i could that's how important mantles are they're so important and i i told my husband knows throw me in the back of the truck there was a double cab and margaret drove all the way there and we were listening to um billy brims tapes about had all those who had passed on before she had recorded things and i think john g lake's son-in-law was speaking and he was talking about um speaking in tongues and i'm telling you it started to get really hot it was so hot and all of a sudden the holy spirit said i want you to claim it and so he was speaking under the anointing of the lightning power of god that was one of the things john d like operated in it just blasts the enemy out it's still a part of the fire of god and god said claim your healing and i yelled i couldn't speak up until that point it said i i claim it and all of a sudden a fire came through the speaker hit me at the end of my feet when i went my body and drove the sickness out and i was instantly and i was on fire it started getting so hot in the cab and i know the holy spirit was just laughing he was so celebrating see because i out of an act of obedience i was just dared to do it and when we got to the event when we got to the this place in memphis where i was speaking about albus and why god called him and anointed him and was talking about that mantle then people ran forward to get prayer the holy spirit said impart the fire of the lightning power of god into them i'm like when did i get that and he said you said you received it and i said i thought i received him and he said oh you have the mantle of the lightning power of god that john g lake operated in and since that day i have used that lightning power god it destroys the works of darkness no matter what is about and i did it so much so many times john g lake actually showed up at my event there you could see by several people who were present and he was just watching me release the lightening power of god i can tell you what's going to be the lighting power of god is going to be at that event people and it destroys the warts of darkness in your life in cities and regions and i mean no guess what it's probably going to show up there probably john g lake that's where he's from and so expect the lightning power of god expect the miraculous to happen and i do expect things to happen that never happened before so it's going to be a power a power encounter of god of holy spirit of jesus of this whole area being least at least released into its destiny to bring the life and the power of god into this country and then throughout the world so this is a major encounter time on god's timeline so please don't miss being there because we are all a part of this when we come into agreement great power is released wow that is so powerful that's why uh you know as myself and prophet shiro we prayed about a title for this encounter you know uh the washington glory invasion because the lightning angels of course the thunders and lightnings from his throne are actually angelic hosts that are being released from his throne okay those angels are going to be invading and they're they're already invading right now those angels are going to be invading this time and i believe right now even from that event conference region to wherever you're going to be connected or watching from to be a new measure of power a new measure of these mantles a new measure of healing don't be afraid of kobe don't be afraid of vaccinations don't be afraid of what the world says there's a new wave of miracle working power and healing as being so we're going to tap into something it's going to be incredible i can't wait to just celebrate the lord and and just to party with heaven all together it's going to be incredible um now uh of course right now uh as we're about to bring this broadcast to a close but uh we want to pray for you people of god we're

heaven that has surrounded us and are in and out of this building continually this night god we thank you for our guardian angels god and all that they have done for us father we thank you for watching over us for guarding and protecting what you have placed inside of us god thank you for helping us father to walk holy in the earth god holy unto you surrendered father laying down our life and living it in your son we thank you for your son and all that he has done all he's made available for us father it is precious and is holy i thank you for this holy time on earth god that we are all chosen to be a part i say yes father [Music] i say yes to whatever you want whatever you need me to do whatever you need me to say wherever you need me to go god that i will represent you that i will represent heaven god that we are all forerunners in this time we're forerunners for the body of christ father that you're changing our lives and changing our words because you have shifted us onto your timeline we cannot remain the same when we hear about the wonder and the glory and the splendor of your home and then we carry that god they will take the knowledge of the glory around this earth many times over demonstrating and manifesting for you and the way he's never seen before experienced before we thank you god that we're about to stun this earth and shock hell [Music] [Applause] as we walk in the shoes of your son and we run our race father the way you designed us to run it i thank you god for stirring up every gift and every person here tonight god i thank you for giving them witty ideas and inventions father this is your plan for now in the earth this is a new time and we're going to be that new creation that you designed us to be we'll have new words to hear and share about you about heaven i thank you father for this holy time we are grateful [Music] that you have revealed that we lived in you and you have sent us to this earth to love and live for you and to share truth and then take us back to you we thank you god that we will be in all of eternity with you it'll go from glory to glory splendor to splendor the wonder of you inside of us i thank you for the father and everyone said amen amen wow this is an awesome atmosphere thank you for coming everyone the only thing i like more about going to heaven is sharing it i can't teach you how to do that i have a commission to do that i can tell you that he is catching people up all over this world and showing them his home for christ said in my father's house are many mansions and i can assure you that his house is not a building it's not a platform somewhere in the sky it is a world bigger than our galaxy even bigger than that there's no way you can measure it or even understand how he designed it it's always been his home until the day he makes the new earth and then we all have a home together i don't know if you realize this is actually willing to leave his own home to live with us christ had to leave it when he became down to earth and he became flesh had flesh put him he died on the cross the holy spirit moved his base of operations here because christ sent him here and then one day the father himself will leave heaven and forever live on the new earth with all of us in that amazing that they had to be willing to do all of that for us that's because he loves you that's because you actually came from him everyone who ever existed came from him you didn't live somewhere in heaven you lived in him he was your very world the enemy is always trying to copycat what god has he wants to be god that's never going to happen it didn't happen back in the ancient times when he was thrown out of heaven when he was so convinced he convinced himself he had won he got a third of the angels on his side which still is almost it makes you undone to think about that doesn't it they lived with the god who made them and yet they chose a creation over the creator and let me tell you just because god didn't say anything to him didn't mean that he didn't know about it but the more he deceived and the more god remained silent he thought that he had won he thought he was smarter than god and then he found out in a second he wasn't anything he wasn't anything he was kicked out of heaven all the angels were kicked out with him they can never be restored and i know you may hear people preach that one day god will forgive everybody that everyone will go to heaven he'll forgive lucifer he'll forgive the fallen angels that will not ever happen their future is already sealed in the lake of fire they will not be anywhere near us on the new earth it says the former things will be remembered no more in heaven right now though you give testimony of your life and the victory that god gave you on this earth when you get to heaven but one day none of the things that that were a part of your life are without him well you will not even be able to remember them but i will tell you right now even on this earth we will become so supernatural like him let's say this together god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the earth that's his plan for you so people say that we can't be like him they're wrong he would have never said that and in case you didn't know after the likeness is the way they operate so he didn't just make you in his image he gave you things inside of you so that you could operate like him so who is he he's a creator right jesus christ is a commander is that right holy spirit goes every knows everything all at the same time holy spirit is an unlimited layered being don't you like revelation he has unlimited layers of himself and every layer of him is a whole of him so wherever he sends a layer of himself he knows everything everywhere all at the same time so for your information when you invite holy spirit to indwell you you don't get a little piece of him he sends a layer of himself which is a whole of him who indwells you and that is what makes you the temple of the holy spirit that is one of the most important things you can do after you get born again it's not even preached in some places right now you know because the enemy is terrified of that happening to you because then instead of walking beside you it says the word when you get born again he comes alongside you is that right and he'll be there all the time until you're caught up to heaven one day unless you do something about it unless you choose to ask him to indwell you you have to invite him say we must invite say we had to invite christ to indwell us we have to invite holy spirit to indwell us it's heaven protocol and the reason for that is you had to make a choice you chose with your will to receive christ and let me tell you we actually have a new cd card born again that the father had me just make it tells you what happened in the spirit realm what happened in eternity in the scrolls of time and the lamb's book of life in hell and inside your very being that made you the new creation what happened at that time at that moment in time and it's on this cd called born again it's one of the best witnessing tools i've ever had or ever made it explains why christ why do you have to receive him what happens when you receive him what levels you can go after after that happens what happens when holy spirit indwells you what happens all around you what happens with the host of heaven what happens with your guardian angel this if you're not aware of the spirit realm the unseen realm i'm talking about the unseen realm it says everything that was made that you see was made by that which was unseen that means the unseen realm is the original realm not this physical realm this physical realm is temporal it's temporary that's what that means but eternity is in this in the spirit realm there's more activity in the spirit realm than there is in the scene realm there's it never stops activity never stops in the unseen realm not around you not around where you live not in the atmosphere not into the third heavens there's continual activity both from heaven and from hell and what you do in your life will draw one or the other to you that's why you need discernment that's why you need holy spirit that's why you need to pursue an intimate relationship with jesus christ there's a lot of stuff going on in this world today even in the body of christ that shouldn't be happening there's a lot of good and there's a lot of god i'm not going to discount that because god is pouring himself more and more into this world christ is making himself known to us every day of our life you can increase in that relationship with him because he wants that kind of relationship with you he's not sitting on the sideline watching your life go by no he armed us when you were born again you got weapons you got the anointing you got authority given to you because you you are now a son of the living god your son or daughter of the living god and what you do with your life after you receive him is totally up to you but right now living on this earth are many that he called to demonstrate for him in the greater works that christ talked about they're beyond your imagination to even consider or think you might actually get to do some of that like going to a funeral and raising someone the dead that was cremated [Music] i hope i got someone's attention everybody say that's a greater work people think well you know lazarus was dead for four days correct that's in the scriptures he was dead he was stinking his body was stinking mary and martha we're trying to show christ it is too late let me tell you christ did not cry because lazarus died he said it was going to be okay didn't he yeah because he knew who he was you know he cried because they didn't believe it they were doubting him he had said yeah he'll be resurrected yes we know on the day that the dead in christ is raised he'll be raising who's trying to say no right now you know he was there right he knew what was going to happen let me tell you people in abraham's bosom were shocked do we ever think of that how many people don't know what abraham's bosom was let me see your hand it's okay if you don't know a lot of places don't teach that anymore before christ died on the cross and descended into hell and wiped up hell went up to heaven and poured out his blood on the mercy seat when people when righteous people died that god called righteous they descended into abraham's bosom which was a spiritual abode god made for his friends they didn't sit on rocks it was a spirit round place it had golden buildings it had a sky it had a magnificent river it had king's tables filled with feasts for them to partake of and below that was hell and there was a great gulf between them this is what the word says and those in hell right inside the gates of hell you come up to the courtyard of hell you could see up into abraham's bosom but you couldn't go there they could see them if they came close to there was like um i'm trying to think of the word my mind's not in the natural realm at all right now i like a balcony reigning thank you holy spirit in this beautiful place he'd made for abraham isaac jacob joseph who raised jesus right john the baptist was there is that true yes because they were righteous they were kind of righteous either because they believed in god himself and they extended their faith for that when they died they went there they didn't they didn't descend into hell that was for the wicked dad but they could see each other at one point and so people in abraham's bosom already knew the messiah was on the earth as soon as joseph went there they knew because he wouldn't stop talking about it if you knew that and you went there would you talk about it yeah he nonstop talked about it and then when john the baptist went who was his cousin he confirmed everything joseph said but he even knew more because he was there after joseph he was still there living on the earth after joseph went and descended abraham's wisdom so then john the baptist was talking about him he actually saw him right he baptized him he wouldn't stop talking i have baptized the messiah he is here on the earth he's here so they already knew in abraham's wisdom the messiah was on the earth so let me tell you when he showed up there they knew who he was and he proved who he was because he himself left for the first time left abraham's bosom and crossed over into hell on his own because he had an assignment it was to take back our authority and our dominion that god had given you know had given adam and eve and then they they sold out but you know what they were redeemed yes they're in heaven say yay adam and eve are in heaven how about that they made it so sometimes you don't really think about the whole scope of this picture and so as someone else came to abraham's bosom they would tell them what was going on on the earth because they were new the new arrivals and it's just like in heaven when somebody newly arrives they'll chase you down they'll start getting you the minute you come in the gate and you're standing trying to jump in the river they're like okay what about this whatever this is i heard this was going on what about this is this true now i saw something from the portal but i didn't know all about so why don't you why don't we go share somewhere they want to haul you off somewhere and share with you they want to hear what i want to hear what you have to say and later you're going to have meetings every one of your family members had to stand on a platform and share to the body of christ living in heaven about their life how god redeemed them what was going on around them and then what was newly invented on the earth they won every time somebody new comes they want to know i promise you it was exact same in abraham's bosom okay you don't get a chance to do that when you go to hell okay you have no life in hell been there and seen it you don't want to go there there's people right now saying there is no help they may find out one day there are there definitely is it talks about it in the word it exists it's there but in abraham's bosom life was amazing it was beautiful they had feasts to eat you don't get anything in hell there will be no food in hell i love that one song that says they don't see they don't serve breakfast in hell if you haven't heard it i think isn't it uh it's called like my father's house isn't that the name of the song but yeah big big house is big big house and they are telling people you won't get breakfast in hell you don't but abraham's bosom had more than enough and plenty they needed to enjoy their life they were always excited when somebody knew came there and most of the time they didn't have to ask them they came there talking about it especially once the son of god and the messiah was on the earth that was the number one subject they wanted to know about i know i was taken there i saw abraham's bosom it wasn't some little tiny hovel on a rock people picture them sitting in the middle of the earth you know trying to escape the lava the spirit realm supersedes this physical realm that's why spiritual beings can pass through the walls they can walk through you your angel stands in you most of the time yeah they sit on you too sometimes especially if you ever get out on the floor if you're knocked out by the spirit of god or the glory whatever it is that gets you on that floor and you can't move your angel is sitting on you you can't even crawl i've been there i'd see them sit on me and they wouldn't get up and all i could do was laugh i mean i couldn't crawl like tell my family don't bother me until i can crawl up to the you know alter leave me there you'll find out one day everything they did okay for you and to you but there was big news in abraham's bosom about the messiah once lazarus came he was dead for four days where do you think he was he was the newest thing in abraham's bosom and that man who was one of christ's best friends knew beyonce who he was he would not stop talking about the messiah and here he is like into his starting his fourth day there just going full steam ahead wham [Applause] they lost their messenger they heard a voice [Music] lazarus heard him he heard him calling him from there did you think he was going to say no i'm busy later when i'm done oh he did not care okay he called him to come forth he came out of abraham his spiritual body came at abraham's bosom back into the tomb picked up his body and he came out of that tomb still in the wrappings and he wasn't stinking [Laughter] because he was fresh alive by the glory of god raised up from the dead to be a miraculous demonstration of the power of jesus christ which has been given to you and i you should see it that way we are joint heirs with him what he did on this earth we have the ability if we walk in and go after it to do that he said that we have the ability to raise the dead right heal the sick raise the dead cast out demons is that right trump is supposed to you're right you're supposed to follow us if you believe you got to remember that there are requirements to all those who believe right these shot these signs shall follow them and so here was christ demonstrating it doesn't matter how long it doesn't matter if your dad you don't have you know no matter if you died right then raise him up no he was dead for four days so if we're gonna do greater works that means it has to be something greater than being dead for four days but he didn't mean being dead for seven days he meant when you were ashes i i was taken forward in time and i literally was shown this is one of the greater works and christ took me there and i saw somebody raising someone from the dead at a funeral that had been cremated and everyone in the funeral home ran down front through their face on the floor and began to cry out to jesus christ [Music] and i i am absolutely what he shows me is literal he doesn't show me symbolic things ever he treats me like i may he says i'm going to show you so you know what i'm talking about that is something that will happen i'm sure it will go viral around the earth so the knowledge of the glory sometimes will go through the internet [Music] did you think about that that's something worth watching over a few times isn't it people watch laughing dogs 10 million times and i want to point out no matter what tragedies and stuff are going on out there the laughing dogs top all the doom and gloom and the wicked evil stop because people want something that they're going to enjoy so why don't you give them something to enjoy your testimony should be filled with glory power right victory that's the word of your testimony you overcome with that that's not the story of your doom and gloom and and 10 hours of your sufferings that's a story a testimony is how you were tested and you got victory and christ gets all the glory for it he actually told me to tell you if you're writing a book about your life make sure he gets more than 10 pages because it won't be worth reading if you make people suffer along with you through your entire life and at the end you give an ounce of victory that doesn't show them that they can overcome even during the in the midst of what they're going through you should have victory every day of your life because he delivers us out of it all right so start giving him the victory the minute you step into something start declaring you have victory you're giving him the glory it's because of him not you that you are an overcomer because your words have power if you don't remember anything else remember to watch your words what do you want in your life what do you want in your family's life what do you want right now in your life because what you say is what you're going to get the word says you'll eat the fruit of your lips is that right whatsoever you will have whatsoever you say it loud you should have whatsoever you i think that means your words are important he made me count my words one time every time i opened my mouth i had to think about what i was going to say he trained me to speak life and not negative not negative unless he shows me something that he has said i am to be aware of and to not be a part of i don't run around spending my life critiquing everybody else's life and pointing out all their weaknesses because you're not helping them when you do that you're not you need to talk about people's strengths their gifts right god's plans for them share the truth with them while you're doing it because they're going to open they're going to be open for you to speak to them if you're encouraging them not blasting them and i also know that you help the enemy when you blast them it's like you're part of the enemy's camp this is my assignment to tell them how wicked and evil they are how far they have fallen from god that they're walking in hopelessness they'll never have anything no that is the enemy's words that's how he talks if you hear that don't say it if you hear those words turn around go i know who you are and i'll have nothing to do with you you'll freak him out because most people just say what he says right so if we're going to be like christ in the earth we have to be careful what we say how we live the choices that we make in our life your soul is fed every minute of the day by what you say what people say to you what you watch what you hear and places you go your soul is going to be whatever this is the way god said whatever you enter into is going to enter into you that's a quote a quote from heaven what you enter into will enter into you that means in your soul and that's important because you are a living soul we've all said you know we have we you know we we we we're a body we are a spirit we have a soul no you are a soul you are a soul wrapped in your spirit man and you have flesh on your body so you can have dominion in the earth but you are a soul and you choose whether it prospers or not if you want to prosper and be in health then you guard what goes in your soul you can change the way you think the way you respond even what happens to you tomorrow by what you decide tonight to do with your soul you can't take your soul and set it on a shelf and pretend like it's something bad because when i grew up in in denominational churches they always said the soulless realm is bad your soul is bad well then how come it got saved [Laughter] i was eight and i would have all these big questions for people that they didn't want to answer if my soul just got saved right he came to save souls right if i gave it to jesus and he moved in then why is my soul bad i don't think anything bad i'm not looking at bad stuff i mean just only eight years old but they made decisions when i was young i was going to be in the side of my parents i was going to be on god's side you know i was going to help him he needed help so i really consider what i do with my life even when i was young i did so i escaped even though i was raised as a teenager and the whole drug thing when it first came out by by the way marijuana is bad no matter what they tell you that's from heaven he did not make it so you could smoke it i don't care if it is a natural plant i will preach it i grew up in that time when it first came well in my era when it first came people lost jobs they lost friendships they got sucked into lsd and all the other drugs i didn't do any of it i decided at 15 i was having nothing to do with it and i wasn't participating so i still have all my brain i'm in great help because i never participated in the drug thing i didn't need anybody else's approval i wasn't part of a clique i didn't know that peer pressure bothered me actually i tried to talk all my friends in high school well my acquaintances i didn't have a lot of friends i had i had a tribe at home i would tell them i'll look right um i said you're nuts for taking this stuff you're gonna burn your brain cells up you know what are you gonna become you can't even think right and people got i think i think 60 out of 600 seniors uh od'd in my senior class off from drugs and all of them started on marijuana every single one of them they actually give it to you free they give it to you free get you hooked up then they bring something stronger to you that's how it works i was in the elevator in the hotel and i heard a young man he had come here on business to meet with some business people here and he was saying on the phone not knowing who i was we blasted him with the anointing the whole time was there when he left he said oh yeah i had a great time my business meeting were very productive and he said these people were they were real real with me we drank and we smoked some i knew what he meant okay he didn't need it for medicinal purposes but these were leaders in a business community that gave it to this young man that's not even ethical it's not right he hadn't even had it before but that's the enemy's plan and he was saying man this was an amazing experience in my mind i'm thinking devil you are not getting that person man i was standing right now releasing the anointing him he walked out the door we sent the host of heaven upon all the strongholds of the demonic the addictive demonic to pull that stronghold off of him and pull it off of him and we were sending on the glory after him the anointing after him to break the yoke of darkness off of him and went god i am not tolerating this i'm not tolerating it and people well jesus didn't he said he talked about any kind of pharmacia that was drugs even back in his day they had them he talked about necromancers have nothing to do with the necromancer that is witchcraft there's no good witches and there's people that really think there are there are no good witches warlocks wizards magicians there was not one magician in the bible that was good and we're sitting here we've been so consumed with society and the world itself that we've accepted a lot of stuff but let me tell you he never accepted it so we need to take a good long look at ourself and say where am i where am i and what god has called me to be what he what he showed me i am what christ gave me how did he walk what did he do we had braces forever what would jesus do not a lot of what goes on now because if we're witnesses our life's supposed to be a witness right you didn't know you were going to come to church tonight because i'm saving the good stuff for next all those in abraham's bosom they lived a righteous life according to receiving god okay they believed who he was they believed when he spoke they believed they followed him and what he said and so they were kind of righteous so they were they descended in abraham's bosom but the minute lazarus showed up they knew something was going to happen on the earth not just to them they knew somebody changed for them because their messiah had come they knew it they knew something would be manifested in the earth and it certainly was maybe not what they expected but let me tell you when christ himself showed up a little while later with the thief from the cross because when christ gave up his spirit he'd still be hanging there by the way he didn't no one killed him he laid down his life he actually had to make his spirit man leave his body he himself loosed it from his body yeah that's going to be in a movie one day and then you will see in the movie christ descending into abraham's bosom him sharing the good news with them all receiving him as christ as their savior and let me tell you when the spear men entered into that ground there was such an upheaval that they themselves walked on the earth that were in abraham's bosom go read the scripture they were seen walking on the earth is that crazy you'd think they'd get a hint right okay uh that one's from a hundred years ago 300 years ago he's walking on here something's going on down there [Music] and christ wasn't numb because then he was going to go wreck hal my favorite one of my favorite times was when they took me when they took me down into hell and i was there on the third day when christ wasted them [Music] it will be in a movie [Laughter] [Applause] not even a world-class movie a heaven-class movie that will be produced on this earth by the best of the best with the best special effects that will get people undone everywhere and they'll know what happened there's actually a demand in hollywood they want to know what happened between the cross and when he when he went back to heaven they want to know they want to know what happened [Music] now when he went back when when his disciples saw him ascending into heaven he'd already been there did you know that because when he came out of the grave what did he tell mary i must go to my [Music] my father and your father right yeah because he had to pour out his blood on the mercy seat in heaven so when he said it was finished on the cross that meant that every a sacrifice for all sin for all time was once and for all never again would something have to be sacrificed for sin you would never again go to the temple once a year to get forgiven did you know that they went once a year to get forgiven okay then they tried to do their best all year they go back again and then heavenly sacrifices they had this whole thing that god had shown them to do and then uh there's all kinds of things you need to go back and read it anyway that's the way you got forgiven that's what that's what freaked out all the high priest when john the baptist started saying you know repent of your sins the kingdom of heaven is at hand well they never heard that before that's why they didn't like him so when new revelation comes to the earth there's always upheaval and you're hearing the new what is the new that means new things will happen new ways will happen new words will happen you're living in a time like that right now yeah because we'll be ruling and reigning with christ this is a whole new time that was a new time a fullness of time has come that was the fullness of time so christ was wreaking heaven on the earth before he ever went into hell then he really wiped up because hell thought they thought they had won the second time satan had a brain freeze honestly he did the father said he lost something in his mind when he fell yeah part of his memory banks because he still thinks even now he's going to win he's already been defeated well he was he's totally defeated but i mean god kicked him out of heaven he didn't win them when he was going to take over and go inside the father and rule from inside the father and be over all the people the people weren't on the earth yet that was us inside god he knew we were in there isn't that interesting he knew about us for a very long time he didn't know who we were he knew we were important he knew we weren't angels because god didn't just speak and make us we lived in him forever until he made this earth time space plan to send us here and when he made adam's body when the word made adam's body and the father leaned over and breathed adam's spiritual being his spirit of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul uh the enemy was right there watching because he was thrown on the earth remember yeah he was watching he knew where that came from he knew that was somebody that came from inside god and then he was not well one way he wasn't happy because now god was sending them which would mean a lot of trouble for him if they ever found out who they were so god had a plan when he sent us people it was to be like him on the earth to take authority over all the power of the enemy crush him push him back take our rightful place that christ won for us he died for your sins but he went into hell to get back your authority that adam had given away because he was righteous and they had no right to hold him so abraham's bosom was ready to see a show and hell was ready to put on a show but there's only one person who put a show on and made a show of it openly and that was the son of the living god [Applause] if you if you don't think they like a show up there you don't know them because god put on a show wasn't that a show when he sent lightning bolts from himself and took satan out right and then one-third of the angels were all kicked out the same way they were celebrating in heaven because they had had it up to here with lucifer i don't know anyone in heaven that cried when he was kicked out the gabriel did not cry and michael certainly did not cry because from that moment on he knew who the enemy was because before that happened there was no enemy heaven was a delightful place it was a wonderful place it was perfect in every way even lucifer was perfect in all his ways until iniquity was found in him and that was that he was greater than god and he was going to take over that didn't happen either so he was kicked down to earth and decided well i'm just going to take over here on this nice place i'll just take over here let me tell you what happened when he first made those plans that didn't work either because then god brought the ice age and he was sitting on a block of ice you got to picture this this is reality movie from heaven when he was first cast out of heaven the dinosaurs were on the earth there was there was no sin on the earth there was no darkness on this there's no evil on the earth okay he brought that with him he began to make it a wilderness the dinosaurs began to kill each other because in the beginning they didn't i saw him i saw the earth when he made it the first time the dinosaurs walked with the watcher angels they left footprints the angels in the ground and scientists are still trying to figure out how they can make it into cavemen because they have blocks of like stone with a put a human footprint they think and dinosaur prince god put water angels on the earth to care for them watch your angels yeah they had flesh on them this is a reality movie this is reality movie night and they were here to care for the dinosaurs and god said well i'm not tolerating this anymore you know he's going to take over the earth so god broke the water vapor shield that covered the earth to put mist on the ground so the dinosaur skin wouldn't fall off there had been no storms on the earth at one point until of course they heard cracks of lightning and then here comes all the other stuff on the earth he began to make it a wilderness god wasn't going to tolerate it so the water vapor shield he put around the earth which every one of your family members has already seen this in heaven you go into this place called creation lab and god recorded all of it you get to actually see how he made the heavens and the earth they know how all of it happened isn't that amazing so everybody gets to find that out they know a whole lot up there and so yeah so god broke the water of april shield it flooded the earth until he covered the whole earth and then he blew on it and froze it and there is satan with all of his plans washed down the tubes again because now he's got a block of ice and he can do nothing on it and there's the ice age somebody didn't enjoy it god removed his glory off the earth and it said darkness covered the earth and then we have verse two [Music] that was all in verse one then comes verse two and darkness was on the face of the deep right the spirit of god was hovering over the waters is that correct over the waters he didn't say there was ground over the waters because in the beginning he made it and it was good he created in the beginning of time and space he made this plane to earth and it was finished it was finished and it was good create ted he created that was past tense right and then we come to verse two so something happened between those two verses a whole lot because then he starts to take it apart and put it back together is that what he says yes there was water on everything water on the sky water on the land he took the water off the firmament that was the air that was the sky that was in the ground of the ground i'm doing my motions again people my staff say don't do that my hands move okay i can't we help it he began to take it apart it clearly explains to you what he did right so he was going to recreate the earth or he would not have told the animals to replenish the earth did you get that word re that's like you remodel your home you can't remodel a home that was never there you can't replenish the earth if it wasn't there before so that's what he did everybody in heaven has already seen everything i'm telling you about he began to take everything apart right so that he could then redo the earth and then he began to make the animals and all the life back on the earth all the growth was back on the earth again and then he did something different than he hadn't done before he was going to make man in that amazing and then there was the word stepped out of the father began to form adam's body and he looks pretty good i've seen adam and eve in heaven yes they have clothes and yes you will have clothing you actually get a wardrobe he can afford more than two garments for you aren't you glad [Music] i get asked that question all the time you well your soul's exposed on your shoes though the soul's exposed yeah ask somebody what the sole your foot is if you need help just take your shoe off and look at it the soles exposed on your on the bottom of your foot you're always touching the ground to heaven they still have boots they have sandals they have all kinds of shoes there to wear beautiful things amazing things and some of them talk to you your clothing will change colors and your clothes will change on you while you're walking down the street if you cannot decide what you should have worn and you picked out three things as you walk each one will come on you women [Applause] heaven is not normal concerning this earth it's heaven where eye has not seen your ear heard or entered in the heart or mind of me and god's prepared for those that love him except in the last it's revealed by thee spirit of god so that means it can be revealed right he's doing that at an accelerated rate and he's shown me a lot on purpose so he wasted hell i'm going to go back to the third day that's okay he wasted hell the first day christ goes well i'm not going to touch him on wait and see if god rescues him and he didn't come and he had taken him into the they had grabbed and put him in the far reaches not the outer reaches i've seen there too you don't want to know about the outer reaches of hell okay the far reaches of hell they dragged him back what good is that going to do if the god of if he shows up right what are you going to do you can't hide anything nothing is hidden from god but they thought well we'll just put him back here and hold him well the second day came and he didn't show up so satan's thinking well i am and now i'm stronger than him i was smarter than him but it didn't work but he still lost part of his brain because he really thought he was going to win and he was going to put on a show to torture the son of god in front of all of his hierarchy so he sent out a message for all the principalities and powers come in and sit on the front row and he moved it from the back of hell to the front where the gates are there's a courtyard the gates of hell the really gates there and they could see from abraham's muslims he couldn't put a show on the only ones who could see would be abraham's bosom right he's going to put a show on showing that he's more powerful than god i'm a torch of the son of god he wasn't the one that was going to torture so here comes the third day right he's got everything set up all the prince pallies and powers the big guys are all sitting right there in the front row i actually was i saw that i was there i saw all the little demons screaming and yelling all they do is scream and yell and complain complain and yell and blaspheme and complain and yell and blaspheme they they all the time because they're they're always everybody none of those demons like each other they want to out do outlie out cheat whatever they can that's what they do to each other and so they were like they were full of themselves because they were on the front row and all the other ones were behind them in a little while though they were going to be glad they weren't on the front row satan put all his uh cleanly attire on he had made and uh all of his faults gems well he had the gems god still put on him if you didn't know god put gemstones on him for a reason he had a reason he put he made mountings like in a ring and set these amazing beautiful gems there were like thousands of them on him and he was glorious he was glorious so he still had that glory he thought it was his he's going to lose it if you know what the word says it says christ what'd he do say it loud yeah that's what he stripped he took every single gemstone off of him that god put on him so here's the show's about to begin satan's going to put on a show he was talking all of his hierarchy right and here's jesus not saying a word just like his father he wasn't saying a word and then all of a sudden there was a role of thunder and all of hell's attention was gotten because they remembered what happens after that roll of thunder comes lightning is going to show up somewhere and then jesus christ stands up and there is a shout from heaven and jesus christ starts releasing the fire of god from himself and melted the faces of all the hierarchy of hell he began to they began to burn in the midst of hell fire with the fire of god literally like blue fire was shooting on his hands and i saw them melt like wax because as a little girl i would see them in different places i saw these demons and their faces were melted like that and like wax and i used to think what is that what did that what did that well i was about to find out and i mean literally saw them melted it says he ruined and spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of it openly and that's what he did he literally ruined them they can't go back they've never been able to fix their self okay satan can't fix you if you're in the army of darkness and you get wounded he can't heal you they got parts missing you can't you can't make them cease to exist but they get wounded they don't get healed okay i've seen them the holy spirit calls them shabby debris and if you knew holy spirit like that's exactly what he would say because i see the hosts going across the sky all the time i'm a seer i see them i see the demonic armies after they've been in a battle with the host of heaven they're hanging out for dear life because nobody wants to help each other like hanging on they have these horrific looks on their face because they have just been wiped out by the host of heaven and i said man they look really bad and the holy spirit said i call that shabby debris and they go i can't think of a better thing to call it because they look like debris you know something washes up on the shore where parts of it are missing that was them we better be glad they don't work together well right we're glad they don't even like each other right because the hosts look out for each other they protect each other look out for each other they're there for each other hell is just the opposite nobody cares about anybody so here comes shabby debris they look like shabby debris that day in hell and this is what jesus was saying you will never have the power to hold a righteous man in this place and anyone who received christ they will never be able to take you there or hold you there amen yeah and when he was done wasting the principalities and powers then he turns to their leader they ran they didn't wait around to see what was going to happen to him they abandoned him they left him they were running over top of the little demons trying to get out of the space they were happy they weren't on the front row that day it worked on their behalf and all of abraham's bosom were shouting and cheering and yelling and celebrating [Applause] because they'd already given themselves to him now there is their messiah wiping out the devil he he literally he literally ripped his clothes off threw him on the dirt and one by one took every single gemstone away from him and he was left with none it was ugly because all he had was these spiky little settings that god had put all over in his wings and his beings he was decorated by god and now he has put false ones in there he's made false ones they don't look anything like what he did but he was he was utterly totally completely defeated he is a doormat he is not over you he is under you he is under our feet so what is under your feet under your feet is a doormat isn't that what he says then don't be afraid of him we're not supposed to have any fear in us right and the fear of the lord is not that you will be afraid that he will hurt you it is you are afraid you will hurt him you're so in love with him you don't want to do anything that would hurt the lord that's what the fear of the lord is the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and with all your getting of wisdom get understanding which is knowledge of the holy one don't you don't you love the word i love it isn't that good so there you go that was a reality show from heaven and then he did the the most the greatest insult he did to satan was to take something that not just his he took you know he had no pride left really out utterly stripped him of all his glory and he fell because of that glory but he did something even worse than that he took away authority he took away authority that he had gained because adam gave it to him and he had been ruling with that authority until something changed that's one of the reasons why christ had to come he had to come he had to walk as a man like you and i choosing not to sin say not to sin he had to choose that with his own will not to sin because him being not just righteous but holy okay and then him being going into hell and they think that they could keep him it was devastating to the enemy when he realized we should have never taken him because it said if they had known they would have never done it right it was bushwhack time the enemy was bushwhacked by the son of god and so he stands there after he stripped all this all the gemstones off of him he reaches down and takes away the keys keys represent authority they have always represented authority and you know that if the wealthiest man in a city back in christ's time and even before that the wealthiest people were given the keys to the city did you know that that's not just something we do here on earth you know when you see someone comes to hollywood or they come to a state they've done something great like oral robots was actually given the key to oklahoma city by the mayor the mayor of the governor one of them and they actually redeemed their self because they were not on god's high list because of the way they had treated oral roberts they scorned him they made fun of him they judged him criticized him in the media and the newspapers but before he died somebody got smart and they apologized to him in public they gave him the key to the city not just the city actually they gave him to see the key to that city but also i think the governor and the mayor were both there apologized repented on behalf of all those who had mistreated him recognized him for the contribution that he had done for them and so they gave him the key to the city that's still significant today when you have a key but the wealthy people were always sat in the city gate back in jesus times and before that in abraham's day the wealthy people sat in the city gate with the elders and they were recognized because they they gave contributions to help the city and so they were given keys and they were given money backs and they had authority they had a say over what went on in that city they were recognized by their wisdom because of their wealth and so that's just something that's always been well he lost all of it in hell that day he lost all of his authority all of his glory all of his a lot of respect from the demonic because they realized then at that very moment our lives aren't going to be the same because now we can be wasted by anyone who is righteous can waste us everyone who receives him will now have power over us so their lives were changing even satan's life was changing he had to get a lot better deception because he no longer had those keys to hell death in the grave i'm i probably won't have time to go into tonight but christ uses those keys he uses them for us you should be really happy about that amen we have so many promises given to no no one else in the earth except those who've received jesus christ you have great power on the inside of you have great authority you have already been given dominion on the earth don't don't act like you're nothing don't say you're nothing you have great value everybody person everyone here is valued by god everyone here was given a gift to use in the natural realm in heaven you're going to use that gift whether it's baking cookies making a really amazing barbecue designing apparel designing interior design designing amusement parks making movies in heaven uh sports in heaven are played as worship yet are really quiet how many people have never heard me talk about this before i know somebody who has let me see your hands okay it makes sense because god gave you that gift they are irrevocable as a matter of fact even the wicked have their gifts and they won't be taken away from them you choose how to use that gift in the earth that's why there's people who belong to satan and they have gifts to act or sing or whatever it is and what they produce is dark because their heart is dark they're going to have the gifts no matter what amen but your gift is so important that that god calls it precious is something special he calls you you are a gift every good and perfect gift that's you comes down from the father of lights that was you you were light you were made out of light he knit you together in your mother's womb at the time of conception that spiritual body made out of light was knit together with that physical little dot of flesh and that's when life begins but when you came you had you were that gift already whether it was someone who was going to sing or be a musician dance create a clothing apparel food spices roads highways anything you see in this place was created by somebody it was designed and invented by somebody you wouldn't have anything to wear to walk on to sleep on to sit on to look at entertainment places to go and enjoy yourself you wouldn't have highways to drive on planes to go in those were gifts god sent people to be and all those gifts are used in heaven for everybody who lives there so it's not boring yes they have stylists there they have salons there they color your hair with light this is heaven culture everyone in heaven has color in their hair so wear it [Music] it's like art is considered a form of art okay they also have the culinary arts in heaven everybody eats food and they love it it tastes better than anything you've had on the earth and don't argue with me because the mirror's supper of the lamb is not grapes and crackers if the lord of glory was going to have a supper he made everything that ever existed he's not going to give you just grapes there'll be unending food everywhere everything you love to eat with no weight gain or food allergies and i i happen to know that that wedding supper is going to last a long long [Music] time he has a really big house [Laughter] this is just reality time i guess we're having a reality heaven show of things that happen throughout time okay even elijah loves to tell the story of the prophets of baal because he saw what happened in the spirit realm when all that went on so when you go to heaven now and he shares it it has a whole different meaning like when you get to heaven and you get to see how christ wasted hell you will shout and scream forever there was the day satan was kicked out there was a day he was crushed down he had authority stripped from him he was unseated from his authority that he operated in the earth for generations and ages because something new was happening the messiah was on the earth and then he went and died for us so that every every sin you ever commit when you repent and say when i repent it will be forgiven he will cleanse me from all unrighteousness like it never happened heaven absolutely celebrates every time somebody gives herself to christ especially all the family members who never get to never miss it every family member saw all of your family get born again they saw the babies being born they saw the weddings every birthday on your birthday they go in heaven get a gift and put it in your mansion that's being built so when you come there every year you were apart they have a gift for you you got a lot of family you'll have them up to the ceiling probably going out the doors your pets will be there taking over your mansion if you had a whole lot you probably have heaven's zoo because he has a sense of humor beyond not just his creativity is beyond what you imagine his humor is beyond anything you imagined and you will not stop laughing okay you will laugh till you fall on the streets of gold and people step over you everybody wants to know you the disciples will come to greet you the prophets we have prophets watching us right now from heaven they're watching this meeting right now while i talk about them okay we have the the ancient prophets we have the new ones who just passed home to heaven and are enjoying their reward and their celebration in the throne room i know i've already seen kim clement up there i've seen oral roberts billy joe daughtry i've seen many people great men and women of god i've seen them in heaven i've seen celebrities in heaven that made it up there like john wayne lives in cowboy heaven did you think they wouldn't have on what was his gift cowboy movies and they don't even have to have ratings on them aren't you glad all family friendly every single one of them when i used to speak in hollywood i would say if you don't want to use that gift you better you better go to heaven because you won't use it down there not only do not have breakfast in hell they don't have movies in hell either okay you don't get popcorn you get nothing in heaven you have this little menu that appears and you pick what you want and there's your food right there while you watch the movie the movie that is being captured probably not far from where you're at shown instantaneously in these cedars in heaven they're called reality theaters it was the very first place they took me they could have taken me anywhere in 1996 i was caught up to heaven for the first time jesus warned me walked through the wall of my home while i was doing dishes although i spent a lot of time in prayer it wasn't during that time he walked in while i was washing dishes not my favorite thing to do i tell people i'm not susie homemaker okay i am a business person but of course i raised three daughters i was a wife i had to take care of my home while i was doing everything else at the same time and so jesus walked through the wall of my home he said go sit down the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and i didn't say no and the first place it took me was to have a fun place because i knew there was a throne room i knew there were certain places already in heaven i knew they were there i knew about the river of life it talks about it in the word of god it says heaven is a country and it's a city so i knew they had both even if i hadn't seen them i knew they were both there go read hebrews 8. correct it's in hebrew right it says heaven is a city it's a country yeah so go read and hebrews actually talks a lot about heaven that's where the great cloud of witnesses is talked about the great people of faith have passed on to so go read hebrews it talks about heaven so i knew there were certain things there but and i was delighted i thought there was probably something fun to do i didn't realize that heaven is almost 50 50. half fun and half profound when his children came home he had to have something for them to enjoy and do and so yeah i was the first place i was taken uh jesus came in the person yes i knew it was him i'd actually seen him cut a few times on the earth before he walked through the wall of my home i've known him since i was four years old i got saved twice age four and age five and this was 1996 when this happened so i had had encounters with angels i could see i was always a seer i'd see the demonic operations i see heaven's operations all around me my grandmother had some of that in her my dad had encounters with angels it was a way of life it wasn't like strange something strange to me but it was absolutely delightful to see that there's so many fun things to do in heaven and what's in my books are encounters i had and how people got stunned when god would take me up let me stand by their family members who had just passed away i heard them talking about their life on earth i knew the family members names i knew what they looked like even though i had never met them on the earth then god would walk me through their mansions i would see how the mansion was built i knew what was on their property and then he would bring me back down and then he would give me their family members names and phone numbers on the earth if he can take you to heaven and show you stuff if he knows there'll be hair on your head he knows all your phone numbers right and i would write it down he'd have me call he'd have me type everything down i heard and saw and then it would call these people and say i didn't have pink hair back then when i used to do that okay he still shows me people but but when i started this whole thing i didn't have pain care and i say uh i believe god has shown me something about your family member in heaven would you like to know what it is and i didn't know these people i i didn't know they didn't even know how i got their number i didn't want to tell my got their number i just said god has shown me something and they will go who are you talking about and i say their family member's name they would get they would i couldn't see but i knew they were shaking on the other end of the line and they go uh yes i want to know will you meet me at the mall will you meet me at the park because they sure weren't going to invite me to their home they never wanted to take me to their home they never ever ever took me to their home and i would show up and i would have everything typed down on a piece of paper god even gave it a title did you know god loves to name things he gave it a title like it was a script and i wrote it like it was a script i put everything in quotes that jesus said that i heard them say you know i described the aromas the emotions the colors everything the frequencies that were there how they traveled what was in their mansion what it looked like what their favorite colors were what their gift was because they were using their gift and i didn't know anything about them and i tell them to sit down and i would hold the paper up here so i didn't look at them and i just began to read and i would hear them laugh and cry and cry and laugh and laugh and cry and they would shake and when i was done i'd say do you believe god showed me this about your family member in heaven and it wasn't for me it was for them and they go i don't know you i never met you but you told me things only my family member would know so i have to believe you saw my family member they were so absolutely undone and then they began to tell me they confirmed what i saw because i knew what they were doing and i knew what their gift was because you used that gift in heaven whether they were a florist in heaven or they're designing apparel in heaven uh whether they were over the youth in heaven which the 13 year old girl was put over the youth of heaven and she was 13. and her whole life she planned to be a youth pastor and she met her kids in her elementary school in her middle school everybody loved her i heard from her mother after i shared all the stuff i saw her with her great grandfather that looked like he was in his 20s and he was taking her on rollercoaster rides in the amusement park and i mean huge roller coasters like the biggest one is called the rush it leaps off the track goes across the sky to another part of the track yeah i thought that was pretty cool and the wild thing was the angels were riding them too they were riding them too i could not see the end of this amusement park i've been there three times i could not see the end to it kids got in bubbles and rode over it in bubbles or you went by you went and learned how to fly like superman then you flew over it guess who teaches you how to fly christopher reeves i hear your thoughts he got born again he got born again what did he do on earth he was superman right he teaches you to fly in heaven so i'm telling you this is all this is in my first trip to heaven and i remember every aroma every emotion i remember i remember every word that people said i remember every creature that i saw what they look like their flowers saying they changed colors the host of heaven were there there was these beautiful angels that were green like dust like green emerald dust stepped out the waterfalls and they cared for the waterfalls and the streams in heaven and they were feminine looking they were so captivating their song was so captivating so i remember all that in my first trip and christ i remember christ took me aside before he brought me back and he goes i want you to tell them on the earth there'll be many people in heaven they never expected to see there but they prayed them in if they don't give up on them we will not give up on them if you belong to me i won't let your words drop to the ground and i got undone i think it was the most spectacular thing that happened when i was there was when he told me that because he said it will give hope to so many people because he's a good god isn't he and so i saw this young girl was talking to her great grandfather as they're walking down this path going through when you're going into a new part of heaven there's gates that are always open there's just like columns with gates there's not walls inside heaven and and that's they were going through these big purple and gold gates and they were going to the amusement park i didn't know that at the time and so the lord said get up there so you can hear what that young girl is saying and she was talking about her mom that they had a great relationship when i see my mom again i'm going to kiss her on both cheeks i'm going to share everything that's happened to me up here in heaven i wish she knew i was a youth leader in heaven and then and she just kept talking then i saw them go on a roller coaster ride and then christ brought me back and i got her mom's number and called her and the funeral had just happened and she was her at that time her only daughter and uh although i was told later that she was profited over by a prophetess that she would have a very short life but she wouldn't pack the whole world for christ which she was because of the testimony and so when i was sharing this with her mom outside jc penney's at a table at the mall she got undone and she began to tell me after i told her all the stuff i saw i saw on the roller coasters i heard the words that she said and she she was crying and weeping and she said that what i told you i've never known you've never met you i've never don't know you but you said things only my daughter knew she goes the day before she died the day before they buried her i was in her room and i saw a journal under her bed that was written she was like seven her daughter was 13 when she passed away she said i start to go through it and look at the pages and i found written on the pages these words last night i dreamed i died early and went to heaven early i saw my great grandfather and i went on roller coaster rides i didn't know that journal was there it was wonderful but he only gave me a peak so as fast as the roller coaster i fell back to earth and her mother was the only one who knew about that journal and i didn't know her mother you know what god was doing he was giving me evidence that heaven was not only real but it was fun she said her daughter every day would kiss her on both cheeks before she went to school when she came on she shared everything that had happened to her life in her life during that day and she had planned her whole life to be a leader a youth pastor and a leader that was her goal and she was doing that in heaven at age 13. i heard her say you know that um i'm cheering my mom on you know she didn't know she couldn't see me okay people never saw me in heaven but i heard all these words and she said that she was a cheerleader and her favorite colors were blue and white she was wearing a blue white tunic top and pant when i saw her it was her favorite color even on earth so you still have your favorite colors in heaven and so all these things everything i said that i wrote down that i remembered was significant to her she's never been the same since then she said she was my only daughter they tell me i can't have children god said tell her that she will have children i'll give her children and she has two twins right now ten-year-old twins with strawberry blonde hair like marissa had blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair twins and they have encounters in heaven so we have a good god that cares about you that cares about me you won't miss your destiny when you go to heaven none of your children will miss their destiny whatever he chose them to be here and that gift he gave them if it was a dancer there'll be a dancer in heaven if it was a cookie baker there'd be a cookie baker in heaven if it was a fisherman there'll be a fisherman in heaven if it was to create and invent all kinds of neat a high-tech gadgets they actually have a place called techno city in heaven where all the geeks live and they can create all kinds of just the wildest craziest things you even beyond what we have here on the earth although i saw some of those being brought to the earth because they have an idea zone in heaven and you see all these little sparkles in it like a million little pieces of glitter and every one of them is an idea an invention and god sends he takes a wave of that and sends it over the earth and it drops all these ideas and inventions in our minds and whoever grabs that idea and creates that idea that's why i see things on the earth already that i've seen in heaven they come from him does it say that they come from him yeah that's how he sends them isn't that amazing so god has a lot of plans for us right here on this earth right now everybody in here is special because you're alive right now everyone in heaven is cheering you on to run your to run your race right now in this kingdom age to live heaven culture to demonstrate and manifest for god it's not about how much education you've had it's not about what race you're born in it has nothing to do with any of that it has to do that you belong to jesus christ that you have given your life to him you've received him he put you here for a purpose he gave you authority power weapons he's now going to add to that creativity and invention say i receive it and he's also right now in this time and people are always asking me you know when are you going to start creating things and put it in the marketplace because i will create heaven on earth not just reveal heaven on earth my first assignment was to reveal it my second one is to create it we're going to create many products and things they have in heaven apparel games things for children we're going to produce movies in the earth places to go for entertainment for everybody to enjoy architecture interior design we're going to create walls that will talk to you and they will have movement in them you won't just paint your walls anymore you won't paint them you want wallpaper you're going to get parts of heaven and put them on there new technology is coming where you'll learn how to paint masterpieces with a light wand i saw people with drive-through tattoo powers and they put it on with light like what marking belongs to god it was stolen by the enemy and he put his marks on people for generations there's a scripture in psalms that says some people worship me in in song some and dance and some will put my marks on them joyce meyers read that now she's getting a tattoo if joyce myers can do i don't know who can say i'm not going to do it i don't know anybody who is as conservative and real as joyce i love joyce everybody say thank god for joyce she keeps us real doesn't she i can't wait to see what she's going to pick we're living in a new time like i was explaining john the baptist brought a new time with him there were new ways to do things okay that had nothing to do with the past and a lot of people rejected it because they knew god had said to do it this way well in that time he did things a certain way he himself does never change but he is a great creator and he does bring new things to the earth all the time and people go well if i can't see it line by line written well it doesn't say he's going to have microwaves do you have one it doesn't say he'll have cell phones but do you own one okay it doesn't even talk about cars but do you have one yes because as time goes by new things are brought to the earth and invented that we use to to improve our life is that correct that so that doesn't mean there's going to be that you won't see new things you've never seen before and these are things i'm talking about that will help all of humanity to either in to either make your life easier or to make you have a happier life a healthier life a more informed life there are new things coming to this earth i saw roads that we traveled on that were made out of light and the fuel was the light i'm glad someone's excited [Laughter] i i was shown these new things we will have hologram computers we can reach in and take the things out of the light and look at them and put them back in there i saw several major diseases including cancer that did not even exist on the earth it'll be abolished just think how much that'll change your life new fuels one is coming from outer space are you all excited saying man because you're staring at me do you know how much that will change our life we won't need the fuel from the desert or the sheiks we won't even need the coal from underground okay we won't even need solar energy i'm not talking about solar energy a whole fuel that god already put up there and all they need is the night the right receiver to bring it down in the transmitters in everybody's home to fuel your entire home and i saw what they look like they're about this big and you can move it wherever you want to you go in the middle of desert and camp and have have energy your bug zappers won't be fly swatters anymore because i take one when i go and i want one that big because i don't like bugs when i was 16 at a youth camp and i was finally invited to a banquet by someone who was brave my mama bought me this pretty dress had white lace sleeves to here and my neck was up to here and i went and took that thing that was hanging in the cabin i put on a walk-out to go meet my date for the banquet and something was moving up my sleeve i already told you i don't like it want no little bug it was this big and it was crawling up my arm this way and i was really shy so i wasn't going to tell anybody it was one of those grasshoppers black and red ones you know those things look like they came either from hell or from some other planet they look like they could take over the world and wanted to they had an attitude if you ever looked him in the eye i wouldn't i wouldn't suggest you do that when i'm i'm here like this right trying to calmly talk first time in my life i went anywhere with the opposite sex at all i got this pretty dress on and and the sleeves you know i was i was i was real skinny i mean real skinny and so that's the only reason why that thing was able to get up there and i've got lace you know lace does not move okay you can't open it up and shake something out so this thing is crawling further and further and i'm like i'm trying to hang on to it right and i'm like i thought it was gonna faint in front of them that's not gonna be a good first impression excuse me and i i was a really fast runner i chased my brothers all the time from my mama i ran so fast back to that cab and locked the door and i threw everything off i was going to take everything and there was that big oaky thing this big i didn't kill it i didn't want to go anywhere near i'm like what i'm gonna do i had to wait for it to walk away from my clothes so i could put him back on and go back out there you know about 15 minutes later and he goes are you okay i am i'm really good i'm all good right now and i sent my friends in the cabin to for the demise of the grasshopper so when i go camping i take big things to deal with the bugs but when you get this energy from space okay you can get the biggest bug zapper and probably put it around your entire tent so anything that comes out there is going to get zapped before it ever gets inside it was the most amazing thing it was just like a they had this thing that you pulled it down from space and everybody had them they just had them in their homes i saw them line highways and a hologram light they didn't have lamp posts like solid like this they had little things like this and all they did was have to place them where they went and attached them to the ground they had one little station a little kind of a thing like that and when they hit it the lights shot up from the ground and let the entire highway all the way down you didn't have to dig in the ground plant wiring run all the way down somewhere and hook it up to something this was a new form of energy that will change our world the missionaries wherever they are they can have power all the time no matter where you are out in the ocean on a boat it doesn't matter where you are because it's going to draw it down from space and he took me quite a while showing me this took me into the future and showed me someone this is going to be a great day for everybody and he said in your life in your lifetime which is probably forever it is going to happen i'm not planning to die i don't know about you i'm staying till he's done with me i'll let him choose that amen [Music] i'm not planning to escape by my rapture rug because even we can't decide that right so i'm just trying i'm just trying to share a little bit about what is coming into your lives it will affect you your kids your grandchildren great grandchildren great great great great great great grandchildren [Music] there have been quite a few people that have been caught up and taken over 100 years into the future i've been taking almost 150 years into the future and the perils times had not happened but it got better and greater and more powerful because the body of christ was standing up and being who god called them to be they no longer tolerated darkness or evil they weren't participating with it by by complaining and saying what they didn't have and who they weren't they stopped saying words of negativity you can't live a positive prosperous life if your soul is continually being fed negative words you just can't do it and actually if all you do is take in the doom and gloom you're not even going to be happy do you know god told me in order to create an event you had to be happy you had to be happy you know actually isn't happy better than sad do you know there's more things released in your body that are good when you are happy when you're sad and oppression comes things start changing even inside the way that your body is forming i don't know all those details about that okay i don't know those details don't care about them i just know that your inward workings of your body begin to not be good and if you live around negativity all the time then that's not good for you but you can change the atmosphere even where you live go in your room and say i'm not participating with all these words i'm evicting all these words out of the atmosphere of where i live i don't have to tolerate them i'm releasing the life of god the power of god the presence of god right here this is the atmosphere i'm gonna breathe it doesn't matter who owns that place if you were there you have the right to change the atmosphere you live in you can imagine if the body of christ ever gets this about the new time and starts operating like that how much change are we going to bring we were sent here to help change things is that right christ came and changed many things just a few short years he was here he rocked this world it's our time to put on a show this is all about the show begins you saw you heard about the show in heaven and let me tell you when all that was going on of the deception of the angels it wasn't just like calmly quietly done that's not the way it was done it was great deception and lucifer never told them i'm going to take over and be evil and kill steal and destroy he didn't say that to any of those angels he said i'm going to be greater than god i care more i'm wiser he doesn't know what i'm doing he doesn't know what i'm saying so i'm going to make sure everybody has wealth everybody has power we can all celebrate together while i rule and then he would have his own concerts and said he trafficked his wares he showed off that he could create because he was highly anointed for that and he would do that and he'd draw angels to himself let me tell you a third of them followed him but two-thirds didn't follow him and angels are real beings like you and i they're not married okay god had some mercy on them i'll be married 40 years to the same human being this november and i'm not picking anyone else okay been through it once didn't just survive but i'm victorious i actually is still very much in love with my husband and everybody knows it's a journey isn't it you learn to love and die and love and die and love and die and love and die to someone dies more than the other there's a lot more love and then you keep loving having grace so they can finish dying to their self and then it's wonderful [Laughter] but you won't be married in heaven you'll be best friends you'll remember you were married you'll do things all over heaven together and you will show off who is your husband who is your wife on the earth you celebrate all over heaven you go look at isn't she gorgeous it's the most beautiful thing you've seen this is who i was married to on earth yeah and they won't talk about any of the hard times they won't talk about any of the crazy times okay oh you share them if you had pets you share them because you live right next door and you're i was a you're parent are you a better parent they'll probably visit you more often you share them it's like children like when when um when parents come home to heaven if you if you had a miscarried little baby and you get that little baby you share them they stay with the mother stay with the father but this is it most of those people go everywhere together in heaven and and there's no like there's not like sleepovers okay although people move in and stay with you for a while i'm just preparing you i'm giving you a heads up warning right now when you come home to heaven all of your family will move into your mansion they probably already got their space picked out because they have missed you and they want to be with you okay this is a good news if you're going on a tour tell them to enjoy their self till you get back only they're probably going to follow you on the tour everybody goes on tours of heaven it doesn't matter if you stay with each other it doesn't matter okay i saw a whole i call them community mansions it was like a big hub like a big huge massive common area like probably like half of denver and off of this this com common area which was so supernatural was things you all enjoyed doing together on the earth it was uh even if it could include outdoor stuff by the way you can't say it was all like under a building no i'm talking about it was everything you enjoyed doing on the earth together as a family and then off of this are all these massive mansions coming off almost like a wheel with spokes and every spoke would be like i don't know i saw mansions the size of a city so i can't ever even say how big these mansions were and so everybody had their own space because you come home as his son and his daughter okay that's how you come home because he is your father when you come home he recognizes your son and your daughter and he gives everybody their own space and you will be very glad you have it you will love whatever it gives you to be so supernatural you could never afford to pay for it buy it or even build it here and it's going to be built around your gift the thing that is your passion that you love the most and then you go on tours all over heaven and christ invites you to his own private mansion where he throws a big party for you and invites all the disciples the apostles the prophets to come and see you and they're coming there to meet you he sends a special chariot or carriage to come and pick you up and then he has you decked out like a king or a queen and then you come and he escorts you into his place and introduces you and everybody celebrates that you're there and then you eat like forever [Music] he has a massive ballroom is the biggest part of his mansion because he loves to dance and on all the all down the walls are like king's tables laden with every kind of dessert you can imagine and his mansion sits in this field of flowers that are like six foot tall all of them sing the most glorious songs they are worshiping the lord of glory they will all know your name they will all welcome you as you come down this magnificent drive to say everybody say jesus deserves his own place just like us and he has one but he made a way so that you will never be away from him do y'all like this reality show tonight [Laughter] some people are hearing it for the first time if we're live streaming are we live streaming some some of these people for the first time in their life are probably getting rocked you know their mind is probably still going bonk after the first time i talk to them about something because that's what heaven does to you when you get there you walk around like you don't even know what to say you're looking at everything you're undone by the ground by the grass by the sky by the beings by the sounds the images of frequencies people riding on their worship you know i mean beams of light shooting by and it's a person coming from somewhere in heaven you step into these transport kiosks that are light beams shooting out and you ride on the light to places around here and you're walking down these streets of gold if you can you can look in them you can it can actually see your image in the streets of gold it looks like uh i don't know it's transparent gold but it's beautiful you can't even tell the depth of it you can't there's gems everywhere massive gems everywhere the mulch and the flower beds are gems like real gems and the angels will come sometimes and grab them up and throw them down to the earth and that's how they get in the meetings so you're you're being undone by everything that you're walking by everything that you're seeing in heaven and you'll never stop feeling that way you will never stop being undone it doesn't matter if people have been there 500 years a thousand years 2000 years they're still surprised by god he's he's always creating new things putting new things through there discovering new things it's so huge and massive you know i mean one day i don't even know if we'll get to seattle before he makes the new earth isn't that amazing i i love him i love him more every day and people go how can you carry that because he lets me he lets me carry it i have a i have a i can't even remember in the natural words anymore i have a photographic memory he gave me that from the time i was a little kid it helped a lot in school i look at a list one time you never have to look it again i remembered everything it said i'd read one thing like you know two weeks later we had a test and i would pass every test because i remember but he wanted somebody with a with a photographic memory to do this so they could remember everything i remember the thousands of times i've been there i remember everything i remember every detail i remember the aromas will get you undone the christ himself carries an aroma and i can go places and i know he was there it's beautiful it's a beautiful smell but i also smell the other side i know when they've been in places and it's putrid it smells like death so yes they both exist heaven exists hell exists just like the bible says okay you have to read the word to know it if you don't know the word then he can't bring it alive to you if you don't read the word he can't bring he can't highlight stuff i know how many people have ever happened you've read a scripture so many times in one day you read it and it comes alive to you [Applause] if you read the word you are storing it in your soul and in a moment when you need it that's how come it comes up in you because you put it there yourself when you read it i play the bible somewhere in my house and it's always feeding my soul you can feed your soul at night while you're sleeping and i don't know why more believers don't but i play powerful anointed worship 24 hours a day in my home because he inhabits the praises of his people whether it's in person or whether it's on a cd okay there's anointed sounds songs frequencies if you play and put them in your home it will draw heaven to your home you know that's what we should all put there right so y'all stand up for a minute i want to thank you for letting me share i don't want to keep it really long because i know i have to be back in the morning i was supposed to share about some of my products i there's one called revealing of the kings it's the spiritual kings in case you didn't know this revelation this is the day he's revealing these spiritual kings who will walk in the earth that's whoever runs after that those are eternal levels of authority christ said you will rule and reign with me now right and the agents to come he will rule with him throughout eternity that's not a temporary position there's lords priests and kings and he told me face to face what i have written on my thigh is not natural kings i am the king of spiritual kings who will walk in high levels of authority in the earth no man can give them that title they will demonstrate they operate in that authority and dominion in the earth and that's how people will know who they are so there are priests it says in the word we are priests and kings to our god and he's the king of king and lord of lords that's what this thing tells you about now scrolls of time to have opened the culture of honor how they live in heaven the kingdom age born again that i already told you about powerful and this one which is hilarious not theirs it's called superheroes and there i am with the superhero costume on that was not my plan kids love it so there i am a superhero you all know that if you pray for others if you stand in the gap for others then you are superheroes for heaven i went to morningstar to speak for the women and they invited me to speak to the five-year-olds i did not know now i wore i have a superhero costume it's not spandex tights okay but it's but a superhero blue pants i mean stretch is superhero blue so i would get it right and and i had my superhero shirt on and all my little things that i wear and i did not know that the bible teacher had just taught them for six weeks that they were superheroes for heaven and i didn't know that had all drawn pictures of me wearing a superhero costume because that wasn't even on the agenda that wasn't on the program for me to even speak to them but when i went to go speak to them god said you're taking that with you when i i am like like am i wearing that on the platform for like all the adults and he said no but take it and then when they said you want to speak to five-year-olds yes i will speak to them because i knew what i was going to wear and so here i come in the back of the room and all the little kids are up there giving testimonies and the bible teachers stand and he starts laughing out loud here i am in my superhero costume and all the kids start screaming and yelling so i kind of ran and i jumped into the scene it was a very memorable meeting and then they called me up front they each gave me their little picture of they drew of me isn't holy spirit awesome he set that whole thing up because i had no idea i just said yes when he said take it and i'm like okay all day good and all the little kids uh we took pictures together and i hugged them i encouraged them i told them how how pleased the father was with a great future they had on this earth and so it was something i won't forget it was also amazing so everybody hold up their hands i'm gonna i'm gonna just speak something into your life i'm a prophesy corporately he won't let me do it individually but you know what this is the time for the corporate body of christ and when i say this this is for everybody watching also hold up your hands okay i speak for the most high god and i say you will be great in the earth i say you will do greater works even than christ did i say you live in a supernatural time where you yourself will create witty ideas and inventions and bring them to mankind to change them forever i say you will walk in truth you will walk in the spirit you will move in the spirit you will travel in the spirit you will shake things you will stun hell you will carry the light of god until you shine like the stars in the heavens you will handle the wealth of the wicked you will push back darkness you will run your race with the host of heaven i declare a decree that you are priests that you are lords that you are kings unto your god receive it says your god amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] and you will live long enjoy happiness and have the most fun you've ever had in your life may you prosper be in health and may the host go with you amen

while they're doing that jesus is right behind me on the platform [Applause] [Music] he's right there [Music] [Applause] wow he has an agenda it's called america all right when she started flagging that sound you heard was his train filling the temple and there was an angel bigger than this building outside he was flapping his wings he was moving his wings and then all the others stepped through him and filled here and then jesus stepped right through that wall that's what you were feeling his presence he was overwhelmed and undone by the worship he loves the hearts of those who worship in spirit and in truth and he walked up to me and said i'm going to speak today and tell this world what i think about [Applause] america who am i i am that i am i am from the beginning and the end there is no man who has lived on this earth that i did not make that my father did not carry until they were sent here we did not create evil that was birthed in a created being because he chose it do not choose darkness it will overtake you and consume you it will blind the light we put inside of you no one will take my country no one will remove my name off of your documents or your buildings no one will remove the blood strikes on your flag [Music] no one can stand before me and say they are greater than i am for i am going to rebirth america it will be greater than it ever was before it has not even seen the peak of its greatness america is great because i created it to be great it is my gift to the nations i created it to stand with my people in israel for america is a friend of israel i hid america in their name j e r u s a l e m if you want to know where america is in the bible it's in the name of jerusalem [Applause] for i have hidden it i hid it before i birthed it the enemy wants it if he thinks he can make decrees over my country i will wipe them out [Applause] i will overturn every wicked law every evil decree i will remove every wicked person for i have chosen someone to sit in the white house and he will sit in the white house as president if you do not like him then you say nothing because you're speaking against my plan you don't know my ways and my thoughts for the generations before him in his line paid a price with their life for the kingdom he could not escape being great he's been thrown into this because i called him into this pray for him pray for everyone who he chooses that he chooses by my will but i will no longer tolerate the evil the decay in this land i will no longer that will not will not tolerate the enemy trying to overtake my country for my name is written in its documents for i was with those who wrote those documents even their names have been slandered and lies told about them i will not tolerate it this is a new age i call it the kingdom age it is time for my people to lay down their differences stop your footing you are helping the enemy i say in this day and age you come together for the world must see you loving each other you have to love each other first before you can love others my blessing falls on agreement for those leaders in my house my house not your house my house it is mine and i am taking it [Music] back those leaders in my house who are not yielding my spirit i will remove you [Applause] in this day it is critical that you work together that you love one another this is not about you being important this is not about you becoming somebody it's about you showing me my love my truth my purposes my plans lay down your plans and find out my plans because i choose to make america greater than ever was before i say the world will race after the pattern i'm going to put in america i see the world run after the products made in america for i have made america it is mine many have paid a price for this land i will not overlook their blood crying out where is justice and liberty and freedom i will not tolerate freedom being taken from this land that even the children cannot be saved in their own schools i will not tolerate it you will see the hand of your god move mightily in this land i know i made this world i do not hate the earth i made it with my own hands from my father spoke and anything you spoke i created it i even changed my very image to come here and walk amongst you i know your weaknesses i know your hurts and your pains i would no longer tolerate it in this country for light shall abound and the darkness for generations shall be pushed back regions of light and glory will be created in this country that sin and crime will not be able to abide in because i will erase even the very first steps to the demonic who have threat there [Applause] but you must stand up and decree and declare and make rulings for in this time my kings my spiritual kings will lay out decrees and rulings and i will do them because they will live holy and they will obey they will let me have my way if you want to know me you must pursue me i do not control i lead and i love but you cannot keep insisting in heaven your own way you can't have my will in your way it does not work because my father's kingdom my father's kingdom the kingdom of heaven is coming to this earth even now the hosts millions and millions of them have been sent from heaven to work with the believers to help defend them and pull down the strongholds they are your weapon in this day and age for i have chosen this time on the earth my father has chosen this time on the earth you can either participate or you can stand and watch it happen but in eternity you will be so thankful that you participated i do not want to hear any more trashing and bashing i don't want to hear evil and wickedness and darkness coming out of your mouth if you say you are mine then stop it for i have said this day i offer you life and death i said choose life because every time you speak death you will perish your soul will perish you must love but you must share the truth you cannot embrace the other false religions you are not helping them do not read their articles or their doctrines because they will clutter your soul you read my word you live by every word that is spoken every spoken word you live by it the written word is a guideline but the spoken word never stops revelation is being released from heaven like never before in this day but the enemy also is releasing deception you do not want to be caught in deception you need to be free and full of me you need to be dangerous against the plans of darkness for i created you perfectly and amazingly and then i gave you the power that i carry operate in it every day of your life it's not something you use in just a time of crisis you live in it it's a lifestyle you rule it's a lifestyle when you rule the enemy will run but i will not tolerate the words that are being spoken against this nation stop cursing it and stop asking us to curse it it says in your own papers and in your songs god bless america i cannot curse it if you have stated that you must bless america bless it in every way bless your families bless your friends even bless your enemies for when you do that it gives us the power to run after them liberty and justice we're birthed in this land the freedom to know me to worship me this land has provided for over two-thirds of the gospel to be preached to these nations of the world why would i curse it you yourselves live here are people they live here why would we curse them great change massive change forced change is now in america i will put a trumpet in the white house [Applause] and he will know me and he will hear me you don't need a preacher in the white house you need a businessman in the white house my father is in business that's why i had to be about his business i am his ceo in heaven i know how important it is business will take the gospel further than the church ever could the marketplace will touch this world with things from heaven anointings from heaven stop running around looking for a plan we have a plan is to make america greater than it ever was before i speak to my leaders if you call yourself a leader of jesus christ and start acting like me my agenda freedom and liberty for all justice for those who cry out for justice to love to share the truth i died to set men free not put them in captivity you must trust me but i am hand picking the people who will be in the white house not for one term but if we ask down for term after term after term i will have the people i want because this is the kingdom age and america will flourish and prosper and the light will grow and grow and go to the world it'll be a pattern of what i'm going to do to all those other countries so you my people and the other countries bless america pray for america you will be seating for the change in your own country i know that i have revivals in many other countries great revivals they were powerful i will not bring up no revival i am coming for a habitation not a visitation this day i vote i vote i vote and i am voting for donald trump he will hear my voice i will put those around him that hear my voice he's already selected some that hear my voice because no matter what you think about him he at least loves this country [Applause] he was born here he grew here he worked here he helped here i've always chosen many and leaders that people would not choose that's because you're not me i see the future i've been to the future you have not been there if you have a better plan present it to my father we've had many discussions and many meetings in heaven we've made great plans to release things down to the earth ideas and inventions and wealth and wealth and wealth and wealth and wealth it took money to build america it will take money to rebuild it and make it greater do not say i want you poor because i desire above all things as your soul prospers and you guard it and you feed it life and you speak life it will prosper and then you will prosper and you will be in health this is a day when you will taste of the powers of the age to come that will be my age that will be my time to sit on the throne in jerusalem but this is this day this is the time when you will rule and reign with me i've written your name on my thigh and now my garments because i am the king of the spiritual kings of this earth and i am the lord of the spiritual lords of this earth eternal positions that you will never attain to unless you are first my priest in love with me consumed by me that know me or that are pursuing me seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness sake don't leave out the righteousness his kingdom come his will be done on earth just like it is in heaven that's why you need revelation of heaven pursue it seek it for yourself but not just listen to it apply it because you will live and not die if you apply it i have given you my word this day to go around this world this is my earth and the fullness thereof and i am changing things because my people have prayed and they have repented and i will come and heal their land and heal any land where my people have prayed and asked me to come to begin to celebrate live a celebrated life [Applause] don't forget to have fun because fun is a weapon too says you're good [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] everyone stand up please going to make a declaration to the lord before he goes he just yelled you rule because i rule and the way they salute in heaven is like this i want everyone to do that and say we rule because he rules you ready we rule because he rules [Applause] wow wow i think he voted whoa can you bring my phone margaret i love it when god confirms things and he made a great distinction between himself and the father didn't he he wanted to know who he was i made a little list of things i knew he wanted me to talk about and then most of this was already in the songs of the decorations and besides i didn't know he was going to speak today i knew i would speak for him he came as the lord of glory and by the way that crown he wears his father took it off his own head and put on his sunset [Applause] he was wearing that crown i'll see if i can share a few of these things if i can remember how to operate this right now in heaven you wouldn't need this that awesome wow i knew he was coming when i saw that angel he's the head of his train when his train his train are the are the angels or the host that's what makes up his garment [Laughter] i was really figured he was coming because of the level of praise but when i saw the angel standing outside i knew he was coming i've been sitting i sat in my sanctuary one time and my pastor would always have me sit on the front row so i could sketch because i've always seen in the spirit realm he had me sit there and draw everything i saw in the spirit realm during the service and until one day when i was on the floor on the front row because jesus came in his train filled our sanctuary and then he came in in his own flaming chariot and i was sitting on that front row thinking he's gonna say something and i mean his eyes were that flames of fire his hair was white as wool his garments were so brilliant i almost couldn't look at them and his chariot stopped and he got off and came up to me i was on the floor and he said you tell my people i only came once a savior when i come back i'm coming as king [Applause] and when he just spoke he was wearing his crown [Laughter] he came as king today [Music] he wants our children to have a future [Applause] he wants our children to know how to rule kick the enemy out of their school train the kids they won't ever forget it he's serious i lost my notes shaking i'm shaking wow i've seen the father come when he comes his rainbow penetrates the building before he ever gets there i've seen him i've seen him come with the living creatures the two that carry his throne there's four around his throne but there's two that hold up the arms of his throne they have four heads you know it talks about the ones with the four hats kneeling they're about 80 foot high and their backs hold the armrest of the father's throne when it talks about the wheels the wheels come out of them and they begin to move and that throne moves like this yeah yeah he was talking about him not humans talking but they were talking to super natural humans here today and around the world if you belong to him you're a supernatural human not of this world he reminded me last night you are the aliens he has repeatedly told me there are no aliens there's no other race out there that you might happen chance find in case you don't like heaven there's heaven and there's the other place and after that if you choose that it's a lake of fire there's no other places to abide that's right i'm choosing into that i've seen the other place you don't want to go there i'm just going to keep sharing this message is called made in america so i am wearing america i've always been very patriotic i have voted in every election from the time i was 18 i voted your votes count you need to vote [Music] in this election you're going to vote for light or darkness there's no other platform that's your choices you choose light or darkness i would say choose light that same god that just spoke is about to display himself in signs and wonders around this world that he will do himself but there'll be ones that we do for him this world has to see us doing those supernatural things because we belong to a supernatural god [Applause] you need to see it the true image of the living god one who loves the one who lives holy and yet they have more fun in heaven than they do on this earth if you're going to live heaven culture you have to have fun he wants every intercessor to come out of the closet and you have fun before you go back in because fun will be your greatest weapon in this season he said you need to have all night fun parties instead of all night prayer meetings because when you come back for the prayer meetings there'll be a whole lot more powerful than when you did it before the fun this is a strange thing to the body of christ we thought they had to be serious and profound well sirius and went to sour somewhere it all went south somewhere [Applause] because when the world hears a believer they don't think wow fun they don't think wow they love us wow have you ever seen a group of people that really cared about each other that is not what they talk about then i go man i want to be like them but they will [Music] they will i saw a time in the earth when people wanted friends to be believers they wanted believers for their friends he said it sounds well but it will be popular to be the friend of a believer because jesus did that in his day i like heavens playing better than ours you can't leave the holy spirit out of anything amen i don't know if you know this but in the baptist convention i may be mistaken about the location but i'm not mistaken about the declaration that they've had a meeting and someone high up said we can no longer resist ignore or shut out the activities and the receiving of the holy spirit it literally was spoken it was either at the beginning of this year or the last part of last year spoken to the highest hierarchy in the baptist convention i i believe i'm trying to remember this correct i like to be correct but somebody was sent out to do a survey i don't know if it was to all the missionaries it was somewhere specific to look at groups of what their people were doing and they came back with a shocking report they had all fallen way behind because they visited many missionary places and the ones that were flourishing and prospering were friends with the holy spirit and then they just looked in general when they saw they began to look in general just everywhere and they were seriously shocked and very concerned for their denomination so they really went to the whoever this person was had the right and the permission to speak to them and they said we can no longer ignore this we're going to fall behind everyone else and there's no life there's life where the spirit is they're being set up for the kingdom age [Applause] because you do know the holy spirit moved his operations to planet earth now he's still in heaven because he's everywhere but he moved his operations from heaven to earth because jesus sent him here all three of them in the course of time are required because of what they did for us to move from heaven people go where's that in the bible i will tell you where it is in the bible jesus was sent first the word he was the word the host still call him the word they have worked closer with him than almost any of the other angelic beings because he is the lord of hosts he's the lord of the host he was involved in all the army activities in heaven when he used to fight for israel they fought the human beings watch out they did they did at that time they fought the human beings and and destroyed them angel wiped out i forgot 185 000 something like that it was crazy they were god's chosen people they represented him in this earth they were in trouble of course evil and wickedness which is always controlled parts of this earth and people on this earth you know the devil can't do something himself he has to have a living soul to control we've always said he needs the spirit well he does he possesses the spirit but he still has to have control of the soul because the soul is what you act with it's what you think you choose and display that would be you that's why he wants to destroy your soul that's why god has given revelation on the soul you are a living soul that is a powerful declaration that's one of the things about being a little mini god you know you're not that ye are gods it's not some wild weird thing we're not taking over heaven we're not going to become god but we're supposed to operate in the way they operate when they speak things happen when you speak down here things are supposed to happen they have creative power why do you think we create an event down here we do it because that's their likeness it's what they do really it's not hard when you get revelation of understanding of the scriptures that we were made in his image that means he has a body god hazard body the father has a body a powerful body he's magnificent his hair is white as wool i i touch it sometimes when he takes me up to the stone it's alive it's living it's moving everything in heaven has life in it it's alive he wants our earth to be alive he wants you to be alive we're supposed to be carriers of life because he carried life and centered this earth you're supposed to carry life that's his image the word was magnificent he was fully spiritual he did not look like jesus christ he changed his very appearance he didn't have flesh the father put flesh on him like melchizedek had melchizedek has flesh he's always had flesh he's ahead of a whole tribe of angels that have flesh before we were sent here angels are made in tribes that's why there's tribes on the earth that's why there's tribes in israel that wasn't a new thing god did the angels are created in tribes we had a whole tribe here today you know tribe of the host here god is very detailed and specific when he makes anything we need to be the same way he likes to use the word strategic he's very strategic in his plans right now he's got strategy laid out and designed i've been shown the next couple hundred years for america it's gonna get a whole lot better because when god steps in life comes with him truth comes with him creativity and blessings come with him this habitation you have no way can you even imagine in your mind or even myself and all that i have seen and been shown and i've seen supernatural shocking amazing things but even i cannot contain the scope of what is going to happen through this habitation and it's starting in this generation of people it's a typing group of people we're that type and group of people right now because you know why you're alive right now that's why you're included he timed your birth on the earth to be a part of this some of you may not have any idea what i'm talking about i'm talking for god this is how he talks he has a plan follow his plan you have to know him to do this okay you can't go out there and rule and reign over the darkness if you don't know jesus christ remember the seven sons of skeva that was a bad day that was a bad choice and there were seven of them not one they thought they could use his name and take over demons they got overtaken they probably never tried that again you're not going to get away with saying you're using the power of god on this day his name is holy but this is also a day of greatness and excitement and celebration and i've learned something from the father if i do not celebrate every day of my life what i do i might become weary sometimes it's hard work it's wonderful work it's amazing work i don't have a life because i gave it to him you know it's easy to celebrate god and the vision when i'm alone with him but i have to live with people who are not on the level i'm on and i want them to be there don't drag them there it does not work i'm learning to love my family until god can change them and deal with them it's not my job to deal with them i cannot stop and fix everything for everybody out there that i hear from and it pulls on my heart because i love people but i cannot fix you i give you revelation if you apply it then god's power will fix you god will not let me do personal ministry don't call my office and ask for it and then say i'm mean and ugly because i won't do it this is what god said if you obey it will all be okay i am not going to disobey him i wasn't called to be in the five-fold ministry i'm not a pastor hallelujah bless every pastor on the earth god i want supernatural blessings this day to begin to fall on their sacrifice they've given their life for they've been bitten by sheep spitting by sheep talk bad about sheep keep going yes i will they've been abandoned and rejected by sheep laughed at by sheep even the clothes they where they picked on the way they designed the church they picked at it they've pointed fingers at their family when their own family is in deep trouble you sheep straighten up amen because when you're in trouble guess who you call to help rescue you [Music] don't love your pastor when they come to rescue already be loving them it'll be a pleasure to rescue you [Applause] honor needs i tell you heaven culture honor there's love and honor honor is the second biggest thing in heaven culture you have to honor each other don't fight over what you don't believe or agree on talk about what you do [Music] every single one of you have gifts and god put them in there we need each other we are not an island to ourselves you cannot isolate yourself when you isolate yourself now i'm not talking about when god calls you away to himself he does that he used to do it to me all the time but i still had to come back in the mass and the tribe i lived in and love them and care about them not everyone in my family is happy about me no is that is that amazing i'd have to say half of them are excited the other half don't care someone come correct me i just love them i ask god to bless them i have their face at my war room and i loose the holy spirit on them all the time then there are some who are part of what i do then i gotta be there one-on-one with them where they learn to guard their soul and lose stuff from their soul this is a new time on the earth we need to live a new way okay you need to be like jesus he changed his very appearance the holy spirit was very close to him before the earth was made and they got consumed with all of us they would do things together there's a whole area beyond heaven i call it the retreat even they need to get away sometimes that's why you need to do that when god calls you apart to be with him that's one thing but getting away just to have fun is something that's just as necessary have fun with your family for heaven's sakes they need to see some fun let's all say this father i ask for it and receive funds to have fun when it comes i'll use it to have fun because that's why you're sending it we are his children we can ask more than just our basic needs being met you have not because you asked not people always think that's the spiritual side of everything but we live in a physical realm in these physical bodies it needs to have a break you need to take a break even jesus took a break from the disciples of heaven's name he needed it hard-headed i know what it's like to live with fishermen [Laughter] i know in scottish fishermen i know the scottish ways very well [Applause] and i'm irish and jewish whoa what a dynamite yeah it was quite interesting we'll be married 40 years next year it's been a wild journey [Applause] marriage is bliss in the good times in the fun times always that's why god sends the angels on assignment with the opposite kind of personality they're not given a marriage nor married they are not unhappy about that the ones that chose it before on the earth have regretted it ever since but he'll send the serious ones with the comedians there are comedian angels i have met some they're the ones that give you those awesome jokes to tell that's them [Music] that's that's who they are and they do it on assignment and the holy one profound one does not want to hear the jokes they are focused on their assignment well so is the other one he's just enjoying it while he's on it they sharpen each other and then god makes it even better he sends them home on sabbatical to have fun at the front at the playport they have a playport it's in the sky then they have to go and have fun together after they completed their assignment [Music] together you're going to get a whole new view i'm going to come and just speak about angels one time you will laugh most of the time and then you will pray for them i'm gonna keep reading i'm listening if i ever write people go you need to write a book of angels if i did it won't be what you expect we'll have the section holy profound the fun they have them i'm going to just start sharing what he said he wanted me to talk about how he made america and the people who made america great god's always had people and he would he would assign them he would anoint them is that strange he anointed people that weren't even believers he gives anointings the anointing draws people and that's why people have the ability to influence people it's an anointing sometimes the enemy gets ahold of those people and they are anointed still anointed he doesn't take the anointing away but then it draws people to the darkness and that's why we have so many dark movies and dark songs because they have darkness in them because if they were filled with light that same anointing would create amazing fantastic things that's why he's getting hollywood saved [Applause] [Music] i'll be going there next month [Music] i have a key to hollywood a key to l.a actually he even showed me the seven golden angels that stand around uh la the ones that the city was named for [Music] los angeles the city of angels the first time i went i saw them and this person who brought me started taking me to significant places so i could tell what i saw in the spirit realm i saw those seven angels they were taller than mountains and they had these vials standing over the city waiting to pour them and they poured them before i left because god had was pouring out an anointing on hollywood to help show the truth and bring light and change the producers directors the scriptwriters the special effects people [Applause] hollywood is right [Music] [Applause] they'll still make intense exciting adventurous funny movies but it will not have darkness or evil in it and if it has evil they'll be overcome and defeated by the good in there not everyone will be a bible movie but the whole the whole life of heaven and what god wants to be seen and lived on the earth will be portrayed in every movie there'll be goodness there'll be power there'll be light there'll be hope in all of them yes the blessed coast and so yeah a lot of stuff was planted in california i laugh every time i hear a prophet say it's going to fall off the face of the earth i just saw it fall off into the ocean went well you didn't see a literal thing you must have seen the darkness falling off into the ocean [Applause] he's always had people in america that would make america great our forefathers were some of those we grew up we my age grew up in school knowing the truth about them and what they did for our country and they always talked about god they talked about god we prayed every day in school remember those days in the public school we prayed [Music] that's because god created america and then he anointed people who paid for america to be great people have usually talked down the people where great wealth those people great wealth help build this country they're people who built whole states they founded host states the beginning of host states but two very wealthy people who founded almost all of florida and paid for all the universities and the hospitals and the great places and uh many the beautiful structures and buildings they were they were paid for for about two by two people so he would he would choose people with great wealth and anoint them and have the wealth because they put it back in the country he's going to do that again he's already he's already picked up people to do that and then god said in america i mean you the people he meet the people in america and he said then i set up a miracle i'd be run by the people for the people he put those words in there that was him to have freedom of liberty to worship him to separate the uh the um the government from interfering with the church not the other way around separation of church and state church is first separate church so the state cannot interfere with it that's true then what he himself talked about the gospel he had me put in there the notes i had already he already given me two-thirds of the gospel that's not for me that's from him was paid for by people in america other countries were involved they always happened great revivals happened the welsh revival there's so many in scotland where my husband's from the covenanters those people were the holy people in scotland they were powerful powerful people in ireland i can't even begin to tell you about ireland with colombo and patrick and they had friends of angels angels were their friends and they didn't worship them they sent them on assignments bangor island ireland to this day is called the valley of the angels and they still see these luminous angels in that place because of the price people paid to pay theirs so they had prices paid somewhere in our own country there was a 100-year non-stop prayer meeting and people would work for each other just as they could be in this this cycle of prayer they were crying out for god to come to this country and do something a 100 years before we were here before we who were sitting here were here they did that people have always paid a price here in america died many of them died even in the founding of it and then he made america to stand as israel's friend i already had that in my notes to stand and be a friend of israel and sometimes we weren't always that friend but that is going to change [Applause] it will change many things will change he said i established and made and birthed in america america is different from almost any other nation it is that's why they all want to come here and i know they love there's some that love where they are but people who really want true freedom and liberty they come here for that liberty and freedom there's a lot of very good moral people that come here because they know they can live they're not coming here so they can be beat up and die they're coming here to actually have a life yes and to get born again they're going to get born again i've seen i've already been shown millions at a time will run into the kingdom [Applause] millions of muslims will run into the kingdom [Applause] he didn't tell me that he showed me that he he he cannot ignore who ishmael was in case you wondered this where that whole thing came from he's not gonna he's not gonna ignore ishmael and who his father was right he said he even said they would be mighty in the land and they are they need to know the true god he said he birthed in america and made in america liberty and freedom to worship god in america more freedom in america than any other country if you don't believe that go visit the other countries there's more churches in america than anywhere someone came to our town i think we have like a thousand they came for the super bowl one thousand volunteers were all from the churches they had a plan most places that uh the super bowl comes they have all these party zones everywhere i mean everywhere's party party not the good kind of party and very little things for families we had mass family zones all over our city for all the people who came to the super bowl so they could have fun with their families we had one little tiny area downtown somewhere that was the other party zone and the super bowl committee said they would come back they had never seen such harmony and unity between the volunteers and the people in the city and they were so excited about the the thing that we welcomed all the families we had stuff at the beach we had stuff for the on the river all over our city family zones when god is in your city it is what happens amen and then he said i'm going to share some of the i'm going to give some of the first for america it's important to know about your country our military i i love that you were blowing was that the bugle what were you blowing yeah that was so god because i already had down here to talk about the military my boy this whole group is just they're all hearing what was in my notes or what he said himself if you don't have a church in this area come here he said the military he said i birthed and patterned the military here after heaven's military they have a military they have an army michael that's his job in heaven he's the archangel over the host he has a military headquarters in heaven they have barracks 200 and some feet high i couldn't see the end of those barracks and they were designed and created for one thing to destroy the actions of the army of darkness so they didn't have a job for a long time and now until lucifer decided to take over they didn't know what they were going to be doing they sure did their maneuvers really well and it's not a tourist attraction in heaven by the way people go there they don't stay long they're far too busy to stop and chat with you so now they've all been sent down here isn't that exciting for them said our military was raised up to care to care not just for this country but other countries he said america has gone and defended almost all the other world leader countries that stood for justice and freedom even the small ones who had nobody even the smallest countries they went there even if they weren't thanked they went there because we we don't like injustice our military my husband is a marine he will always be a marine he forgets embarks order sometimes i don't listen to them if i get a kiss i will listen [Music] [Applause] i am not your squadron do i look like a squadron i will show up in fatigues if that's what you want me to wear i will wear them all the time you want me to look like this then i better get a kiss [Applause] [Music] if you think god just lets me run up and ignore my husband you are so wrong you need to get our dvd and cd called passionate power yep it was something he had me activate no my husband i have to make him happy make him feel important and let him have a good time and fish as much as he wants to even though he smells like bait i celebrate when he catches a fish and when i'm gone he sends me a picture every day that's his gift so god designed uh our military he wants he wants us to have a strong military because as long as evil wicked people in the world that want to just kill destroy you have to have that strength as part of your protection and protection for others and he said they stood the our military stands for uh righteousness which means uh in order to be in the military uh tell you they deal with those who are not keeping their self in order because when you're in the military you live military you represent the military as they find out too much stuff is going on you are in trouble they want you to live right because you know that's why you're there to fight right so righteousness justice and liberty is really the hallmark of our military we need to honor them more they're going to be respected in ways we've never seen before in the future one other one other thing and and actually the father absolutely loves nasa because they show us all of his space art nasa introduced for the first time to this world god's art in outer space maybe you never thought of it that way that's how he thinks of it it's not a bunch of dust particles that came together he designed every one of those nebulas spoke them into existence and then the lord of glory made them the word stepped out and made them every one of them is put in a specific place that's why the planets aren't all falling out of the sky and by the way there's a difference in using the word universe and the word cosmos universe is just the universe it is not necessarily made by divine design but the word cosmos means a creator designed it and made it [Applause] the bible calls it the cosmos man came up with universe same thing but it is the cosmos designed by a creator and perfect design i like that word cosmic we're going to have some cosmic times on this earth [Music] nasa was birthed here in america and made in america the greatest place space exploration facility in the world was in america other countries pursued it but america made it a part of them it was also funded and paid for by the people in america we paid for all that stuff that went on and it meant something because it wasn't just discovering new places and images there were so many things created just in the course of making that possible that we all enjoy now new technology we never had before new products we never had before on the earth that increased safety and excitement and let me tell you just if you've never looked at those galleries you need to go online to nasa.com which now get this since the space exploration with humans is done they're still setting the hubble and the other one out there we're learning more and more about what god made out there so they're not they haven't stopped doing something if you ever go to the nasa center in florida it has turned into a huge facility where you can tour it learn things experience things see things they even have kids space camp to be a junior astronaut so they've not wasted all that money we've spent but they have released 99 of all the photos for free and you can get them and put them on anything and you don't have to pay for it from nasa if you go to the nasa galleries you can download download if you want something that's high def and you're going to use it for something specific you may pay a little bit for it but most of it because the people paid for it they gave it to us how about that so that was something that was made in america a first in america was nasa and then he said some of the greatest inventions and scientists were homegrown in america or america drew some of the greatest to our country because of the freedom and liberty they had to create and we have worked closely with israel and their brilliant minds that god gave them and some of our creativity worked together to bring things to this country and this time god will bring listen to us the jewish business leaders together with american business leaders to do contracts with them to do contracts in business and do projects together for the first time god is introducing and birthing and releasing in this time the kingdom age from america we're going to go ahead and pass the baskets we're going to work she's going to keep going so if you guys want to uh bless her and be a part of the offering we're going to go ahead and pass the baskets and we understand if you have to go but we're going to let cat keep going so yeah so we're going to pass the baskets all right thank you for the commercial thank you god for blessing everyone who gives to what you're doing in this time [Applause] increase them in any way every way god and i'm i am still believing and declaring the thousand-fold return the hundred-fold and thousands of return especially if you call them to be in business god let their business come into fruition let it be in their hands let them see the plan one last commercial make about to go m.z gomez gateway on mount zion then we'll just give her one check so she doesn't have a whole bunch of checksuits god is uh one another thing made in america or birth in america is the revelation and details about the kingdom age is coming from me i live here details on heaven culture and how to live that how to work with the host of heaven as your weapon and i know it's happening in other places but the fullness of the of the revelation and the detail on it he is birthing here from america as a pattern we will be a pattern the believers who live here will be a pattern for the other believers to run after that same pattern because then they will prosper and flourish and push back darkness god always raises up a type of people when he introduces something new in the earth we're it that's why you're sitting here that's why you're hearing these words so he's birthing the kingdom age the fullness and understanding of it jesus introduced it but we've never really seen the fullness of the kingdom or even understood what it was it's in all of you if jesus christ lives in you because he's an orchestrator of the kingdom age he releases it from you it's a lifestyle it's a lifestyle you live in this earth prospering and using it to build this kingdom or take this message of the kingdom because the message of the kingdom has power in it yeah it does it's the gospel parents grab your children parents grab your children there get your children it's releasing revelation as a pattern to follow to rule and reign with christ to use our powerful weapons including the host of heaven remember they're bored they have nothing to do they are not defending heaven they didn't even do anything about when lucifer fell and one-third of the angels god himself kicked him out he's always reminding the devil you have lost yeah [Applause] then his son reminded them in hell on the third day when he wasted them [Music] he wasted them in hell demonstrated that not only he had power and authority but all those who follow him have the same power and authority that he lived in it is ours now it's our time to demonstrate through our life and receiving and choosing this lifestyle we will demonstrate that same authority and power over all the power of the darkness it's because this is a new time this is exciting i'm ex i'm getting excited yes he said he said um because of what america has stood for and was created for to bless the world to be a light to the nations to become a pattern of heaven on this earth that is all of our calling to represent heaven on this earth it's wonderful to live in heaven but if it's not your time you are not going anywhere [Applause] our life spans are going to be extended in the kingdom age because we are that generation and type of people that will taste to the i'm talking about the power when jesus lives on the earth and sits in jerusalem on the throne man's lifespan will be extended for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years but there will be a generation on the earth a taste of that the power of that age well there's only one more age after this one it's the millennial age so we are that people that will experience and taste of the powers of the age to come so everybody stand up please that's why you are so important to god and the people around the world that belong to him you are important to god we are to represent heaven live heaven culture in this earth operate like christ did on this earth to bring hope jesus brought hope god is not the author of doom and gloom it is not time he could not possibly put his wrath right now because we wouldn't be able to do the things he wants us to do this is not the end of the end it's not the perilous times this is some of the greatest times on this earth oh we are totally getting the wealth of the wicked there's many ways he's going to do that i know one of the ways that we will do that is by the things we put in the marketplace that they can't create and they don't have they will race after those things in the marketplace i was sitting there today and you said the world will race after made in america products [Applause] especially china i don't know how they feel about that [Applause] i can't leave without telling you to be very careful about what you're buying check out what you're buying make sure it's a good product make sure it's not going to fall apart or explode there's other countries that have been allowed to bring things into our countries that have no guidelines for their products not even their own people are protected and they're putting they are they're putting asbestos in formaldehyde and let even in toys you can get a little i'm just telling y'all the truth okay you can get a tester you can buy a little tester i don't know where it is sometimes they give them away free probably go online and look for them i i'd go in the store and i would look at everything i'm not doing that to put fear in you i'm telling you that to protect yourself and your children that's why we need stuff made here now other countries like england and france and italy and other countries are other good solid countries that make amazing products that have guidelines for their materials but there's others that have started flooding the marketplace that have no guidelines and they shouldn't allow them in here without checking them out they should have to have the same guidelines do you agree i'm sure everyone agrees but people are not aware that almost 80 percent of all the products on the shelves are not good things i look at every label it takes a while even some of the food now is being sent overseas to be processed i will give you a tip organic farms will explode in america organic farms if you can go organic go organic they don't use pesticides they don't use fillers they don't use hormones in the in the meat and in the animals you know a long time ago they didn't really do all that until they wanted to start mass producing stuff well one of the things that will be changing in america is the way we process stuff even ourselves is going to get better i'm not telling you not to eat i'm just telling you be be aware of where you're buying stuff they have organic markets and if they don't have them you contact them and tell them to bring them here we actually ate at an organic restaurant in denver it's called mod market i'm giving them a free commercial fresh from the farm and the i think the mills mall it's near that uh that restaurant that has the bony fish on it i won't be going there if you like fish go there but we ate there and the food was delicious and it was fresh all of it was fresh so it is increasing if you if you see organic you know make sure it's a responsible company but organic farms are going to explode because there is a generation my two of my daughters fall in that 30 year old category and they refuse to give any of their children anything that is not they eat healthy they are healthy and every now and then they let them splurge you know they don't say you can't ever have a pizza but if they do they get an organic one learn to make them yourself because you can buy stuff and make good stuff amen i don't know where that came from i guess god cares he cares about you but our marketplace will majorly change in america all right we're going to all look up to heaven and we're going to do it what the lord said we're all going to say god bless america three times god bless america god bless america god bless america father right now i just impart to all of your children here god the desire to prosper and flourish and be in hell we want sickness and disease to be far from us we want prosperity to fall upon all of your children father the blessings we bless our friends everybody say i bless my friends i bless my family i bless my enemies go sick them holy spirit say i receive revelation so i can be creation [Applause] a new creation that lives heaven culture that loves god that wants his way and his will and don't forget to send the fun [Music] we love to just look up in the sky and and watch what was happening and when kat began to talk about fun i showed margaret the birds were going nuts did you see they were all of a sudden there was a whole bunch and they kept flying by and having fun and then the eagles showed up who saw the eagles oh yeah they were just going so they creation responded to that

everybody i hope you're having a great day we are right here in sunny florida and yes it's actually sunny by the way that system that the weather warriors took authority over last night is like gone gone it's gone so thank you everybody for participating and because all of this that we do belongs to god we're going to start with everyone out there asking for grace so you're going to learn something before we start our q a session you actually should do this when you first wake up in the morning i'm talking about grace for abundant life maybe you never heard about that but it's definitely in the bible there's actually a scripture which you know that should be maybe a homework assignment for everyone who's a part of this there's a scripture that says god said as a child i filled my son with my grace now this is god the father speaking it's in the word of god he is also the one who has the throne of grace jesus christ gives grace for abundant life god gives grace god jesus you all know of course that i'm up very early i didn't wear my shirt that says you know what does it say i'm not a morning person i'm not a morning person and i know you're like weirded out by this but this is my morning right now this is my morning okay now if you called me at six am i probably wouldn't even have gone to bed yet so i'm doing this because i love you so christ gives grace for eternal life that's eternal life grace that's when he died on the cross he gave we got that but the father who sits on the throne of grace come before my throne of grace to find grace for help in time of need that is abundant life grace and you know there's an action it says find it that means you come and you ask for it so as a child god the father filled his son with his grace for abundant life is one of the things that helped him survive on this earth okay that's how he could still be happy filled with god in heaven abundant life grace is fueled from heaven if you will look up to heaven every morning when you wake up and you say father i ask for and receive grace for this day like right now i feel it it feels like light electricity pouring into me a lot of people don't know this is something you can actually get every day and it's like new every day and so we're all going to do this together so everybody even here in the studio say it after i do so everybody can know they have to do it father father i ask for i ask for and receive grace and receive grace for this day for this day amen amen there you go now we are all filled with grace what does that mean that means you're going to be happy things aren't going to be bothering you for whatever you're going to go through that day you just got grace for that so you could live abundantly because christ comes to bring life and bring it more abundantly please don't forget that if it's the only thing you leave with today and i talk to you just like you right here in front of me and being 1 to 15 i have no problem communicating with people and i love people because you know i survived them was triumphant living with that whole family with our alligator in the bathtub and you know umpteen toad frogs that my seven brothers would go out and collect and my mom would have to set them free every night um so we definitely had a different household so i love all of you if you're bashing trash you know we're gonna have to we're gonna have to ban you um but we love you anyway so i'll say that right in the beginning i love everybody even those who don't want that you don't understand don't be filled with fear that god has more and it's called revelation so that's what you're going to get today as we answer these questions that you are asking and jen will take a couple from the comments you know we're gonna we're gonna we've already got a few that we're gonna answer because we've been promising a long time so we're gonna get started so uh and i do have a few more things to share later but right now we're going to start the q a session awesome let's have it jan we are ready you guys can't see me but i'm over here off to the side hi okay um all right so this question is from sharon it doesn't say where she's from okay sharon yes and uh she would like to know that since there is no night time in heaven are there bedrooms in your mansion okay i'm sure everybody heard that but this is from sharon a question from sharon she wants to know since there's no nighttime in heaven i don't know if you knew that but there isn't you know there's no shadow turning there's no darkness at all and having the there's different colors that come in the sky different times well there's not time in heaven just waves of color come to the sky of heaven which would sort of change the effect of the light coming from god himself all light in heaven comes from god there's no sun there's no moon in heaven so there's always daylight there's always light and you don't have per se a bedroom in your mansion because no one's going to be sleeping you do have special rooms in your mansion where they have beautiful lounges for you to lounge on sometimes people want to go in there and and you still go and set yourself apart to read the word and even though god is everywhere in heaven his presence is with you some people just go to a special place in their mansion and just have conversations with him sometimes your special friends visit you and so you do have like the most beautiful place the most comfortable place in your mansion would probably be like your area where you're going to lounge and relax and so but per se is a bed you don't need that and people think how lovely and wonderful well let me give you a clue in the nurseries with the millions of babies there's many nurseries all over heaven they don't sleep either can you imagine being on the list to be one of the angels that care for these little babies and you have to play with them all the time because they don't sleep either but it is wonderful to think that your body doesn't have to be restored all the time like we do on this earth your flesh needs rest and sometimes some people need more than others i sleep four hours a day sometimes three i go about 20 hours a day then i'm going inactive and my family's adapted to that but some people need eight they need 10 hours i'm so glad that i'm up for 20 hours so let's go to the next question jen okay this is there's no name on this one at all but um they wanted to know what is a cherub what is a tear-up oh that's the first time i've been asked that well it's part of the angel tribes in heaven and a chair of people normally on earth if you said the word cherub and this is an anonymous question so hello anonymous whoever you are [Laughter] you ask you did a rare thing you asked the question no one's ever asked me before it talks about the cherubim now it literally says the cherubim in heaven people say many different ways uh actually the cherubim are very different creatures in heaven they are part of the angelic tribe a chair of most people shows a little fat baby angel i have never seen any in heaven i'm not saying they aren't there i've just never seen a little fat baby angel naked no not that either and uh but a cherubim is fantastic they have eyes and all their wings they're very uh powerful beings and intelligent beings in heaven and like the living creatures it talks about in revelation 4. why don't you all go read revelation 4. guess what you get a lot of revelation about heaven itself that's when john was caught up into the heavens and he was in heaven itself and saw many things he actually saw the cherubim in heaven around the throne that had many eyes and their bodies and their wings but a cheer up like people i'm sure and all the valentine cars people i've probably been buying there's probably little baby cherubs holding a heart or something like that but but normally that's probably just in heaven if you said cherub that would be short for cherubim that would be an abbreviation for true of them who are anything but little fat baby angels so there you go that's all i'm going to give you today about the cherub they're part of the angelic tribe there you go and i'm waiting on the next question next question okay this one's like a long list but i'm not going to read all of them i think we need a drum roll for this yeah this is one person's one person now we love it when you send and ask us a question but it's kind of hard when you ask 50 or if you send five paragraphs to ask your question um it's just go to the heart of it and let's hear what okay so this is from paulette in new york hi paula from new york and she she sent seven questions but i'm only gonna do i'm only gonna do one pick one right now and maybe the other ones will show up on a podcast or something okay okay um i had it picked out where is it okay here we go where did the other races of people come from which that's a bible story so i guess she's wanting to know paulette wants to know where did all the other races of the people come from i assume she definitely means on earth right so you need to make sure you say earth or heaven where did the other race because there's races of people who died and moved to heaven too so for me i need a little bit a little bit detail so where did the other races come from on the earth well at one point there weren't races they didn't they weren't even divided into races they just had people on the earth and everyone spoke the same language and everyone spoke the same language which was kind of wild if you can imagine so everyone who'd been born on the earth at one point there was a point on the earth when everyone spoke the same language but we don't do that now and the bible does talk about the tower of babel which did happen it was something that it happened where god uh decided to separate the races and give them different languages and you can imagine when that did happen that some people after they could understand everybody for so long and back then people lived a very long time and you know i know there were some people who lived actually to be 700 years old i think enoch was only 300 that was like young back then so back in this time when for for years and years and generations had gone by everybody understood everybody and yet in the moment of a day there came a time when a lot of people didn't understand everyone else and only certain groups of people i'm sure he chose whole families and relations to those families gave them a different language and that caused those people to separate create their own groups of people and maybe even move where they could all be together so they could understand each other all the people on the earth according to the bible adam was the very first one and it talks about adam being the first man on the earth adam and then of course he created eve they were the first ones he put them in the garden of eden a lot of people know that part and then of course they had sons and then the population began to build but there came a point and it was at the time of noah that this happened this certain thing happened that that was when he got wiped out the earth because the people were so wicked so evil can you imagine that there are probably hundreds of thousands of people on the earth that they were so evil and wicked that he only kept noah and his immediate family and they were kept on the ark and the bible says from the time of noah onward everyone on the earth came from the lineage of noah so i can say what i know as far as what the scriptures say that from the time of noah everyone on this earth is related to him because of course everybody else was taken off the earth and people newly born on the earth all came from the lineage of noah so i can just say that and there was a time when the groups of people were separated by god given different languages so we'll just go with that for right now uh there is some things i may as well just add this to cause discussions between between all of you there what there are some theories that people believe after adam and eve god kept creating people now i don't know and if you find it in the word maybe you could inform us in the comments i can't find it in the world where it says every single human being came from adam and eve because the the race was all destroyed but at one point when noah was saved the word does say that from the time of noah everyone else on the earth was related from the lineage of noah so there is this possibility that people talk about all the time that god could have made adam and eve he could have made other people on the earth because he was really trying to accelerate populating the earth and there's always questions like well who did adam and eve's sons mary who did they married was it their sisters was it someone else where did other people come from i think we will all probably wait until we get to heaven to get that question answered so there you go next question okay this is actually from facebook um this is specifically for you and um they must be maybe new people that haven't heard stuff from them okay yeah there's always new people you need to consider that i'm going to add this for free there are people who find me and that's what they say it's very funny i found you on youtube i found you on facebook or i met you on youtube or i met you on facebook i met you on twitter i met you on the podcast for the first time and now we have instagram and now we have instagram hey so we're really expanding out there and so every day throughout the day there are new people discovering me so they don't know a lot of the revelation those of you who have been watching and listening for 10 years you know a lot but you still have to consider here's some new person who's watching maybe just found me by accident like oh my gosh look at that person she's got pink hair but she's talking about god okay so what is the question well it's from jonathan and patricia and it says do you leave your body when you visit heaven oh that is a very good question jonathan and patricia jonathan and patricia welcome to our q a session and that is a wonderful that's a wonderful question they want to know that when i am caught up to heaven do i leave my body because some people think where does your body go does your spirit man go and that'll give me an opportunity to answer a couple other things to make it clear i don't go in my body my physical body stays here on the earth my family all know that because if they come in my room or if i'm sitting in my desk or something else if they come up and speak to me and there's no response at all i'm just like staring saying nothing they know that my spirit man is in heaven so i am caught up by my spirit and i am taken to heaven i don't make myself go okay god's never done that with me he's always just caught me up either by the spirit of god sometimes jesus comes and just catches me by my spirit when i'm in heaven i don't look down and see my body i don't look down i am focused on what they want to show me in heaven and yes this has been going on for a long time for a very long time since early 90s i've been caught up i had got off to heaven taken on tours of heaven for the purpose of revealing to the earth what heaven is like how heaven operates what the people look like what their mansions look like places that are made in heaven things you get to do there what about your family members all kinds of things god has me reveal and i actually have a commission i he came to jesus came to me in person face to face and said the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and guess what i didn't say no so it is my spiritual body and this is why it's wonderful i know for sure jesse duplantis go check him out jesse duplantis he lives in new orleans or right outside new orleans louisiana he literally was caught up in his physical body and taken to heaven if you if that happens to you you will know now i know that you know paul didn't know but a lot of people at that time probably hadn't been caught up to heaven if you're caught up in your physical body your physical body is not accustomed to the glory the power and the life of god that is in heaven and eventually your physical body would get weak in heaven however your spiritual body that is is all spirit it's made out of light heaven itself is made out of light it's a building substance so everywhere you go in heaven in your spiritual body you can touch the ground you actually sit in your mansion i have guests in your mansion you travel all over heaven you know on light or sound you enjoy a literal life and that's the proper way to say it so every time i go to heaven i experience everything that is there but it is my spiritual body and when god is done he sends he brings my my spiritual body back zip right inside my body and then i'm aware of everything i have every memory of being there the smells the emotions the things i saw it's all retained because your spirit man has a mind okay your soul which is in your spirit man is what you express emotions from it's what you gather information with so your spirit man and your soul i was caught up to heaven i have both of those my physical body just sits and does nothing so there you go here's the answer all right next question is from bonnie and it says do people who accept christ on their death bed have big elaborate mansions do people on their deathbed have big elaborate mansions in heaven that's really um more than one question but i'll go ahead and answer that question the bible clearly says that god will reward us for our lives lived on the earth you're not going to escape being rewarded by god now what some people think of as a reward may not be the the powerful supernatural reward that we get in heaven and the thing that he loves the most is if you used the gift he put in you like whitney houston she used her gift she sang she used it all the time it blessed god she got she gave herself back to christ the night before she died and let me tell you what she had fantastic reward in heaven i didn't see her mansion but i was actually caught up to heaven and i saw her receiving rewards from the father at the throne this was right after she had passed and you know what this is the other thing whether you have a massive mansion because you really gave your entire life every hour of the day you helped people loved people you use the gift he put in you you ran your race holy on purpose they're going to have fantastic mansions because they gave more of their self now you cannot work for your salvation i have to say that that salvation is free and there is no one in heaven that is sad disappointed or upset so no matter what they ended up with to live in they were filled with joy with celebration with excitement because of what god had made for them but god is a just god and those who really served him loved him and loved others and was forgiving all the time and didn't live with the fence in them of course their mansion is going to be fantastic i have seen mansions in heaven that were the size of new york city i hope that stretches your mind on realizing how huge heaven is it's fantastic it is amazing there are sky mansions mansions under the crystal sea there's an amazon forest and amazing i just say amazon to give you an idea uh there's like massive trees that would be the size of 12 massive trees here they're like 500 feet high there's wonderful beautiful things there so there's there's like forest there's the mountain of spices there's passionate paradise that's about the love of christ and worshiping him so many places in heaven with many different mansions i've never seen a shack or just a little cabin if someone had a cabin it was on the property of their amazing mansion and family members do live right next door each other but when you come home to heaven you don't come as somebody's husband or wife you come home to heaven as the father son or daughter and he makes sure everybody gets a mansion so absolutely i've seen such amazing beautiful mansions and they were the mansions of little grandma intercessors that prayed in their closet and prayed in three or four moves of god forgave anyone who came against them just poured out their life all day for god and even though no one on the earth knew them god was quite aware of what they were doing for him and he rewarded them powerfully but everyone in heaven celebrates the fact that they're there so next question okay next question is okay and i'm only going to mention this because this is like a major topic with a lot of things and a lot of people have said if you don't do this specific thing you won't go to heaven oh this is a good one yes and if and i know what you're going to say so of course you do you're my sister and i've known you since you were a baby but i love sharing this too because it debunks so much stuff of why you get sent in we are myth busters today yes and it's important to do that so people know the truth it says the truth will make you free and we are definitely filled with truth and revelation from the father so we're going to do it right now this is from anna and she would like to know do you have to be water baptized in order to well she didn't say in order to go to heaven but oh okay but it's necessary to be water baptized okay but you can expound on that foreign if you don't get baptized you won't go to heaven if you don't tithe you better you know if you don't go to church yes there's many things um over time that has been developed in the mind of man and man and if you do not many times have revelation from god or the scriptures aren't open to you or let's just say you never read the bible you need to read the bible the true word of god okay and people go what translations do you read i'm just this is a free tip from catker i love the amplified bible i read that's on my desk i have the king james version because it has a lot of stuff that is truth in revelation that's not even put in other translations i i love the amplified i love the everyday bible that's an older bible i absolutely love my main reading bible is the scofield bible because of all of the comments the commentaries that are put in there the revelation that god gave that mr scofield that that really explain and expound with revelation on the word of god so i would definitely say the niv the king james the amplified the everyday bible i'm trying to think of some other versions of it some my my husband likes to read the one that's more like everyday language it might be well it's not the enemy if he was here would ask him but i'll find out let people know later because they're always asking me which ones are okay there are newer translations however that leave out some of the word of god some aren't even a complete bible i'm not talking about just the new testament it's great if you start with the new testament i also love the not just the historical part of the the old testament but the miraculous that happened hey people the parting of the red sea all of that is real when elijah was on mount carmel okay those powerful things that happened way back in those days are exciting to read when you see even god's hand move back then the new testament of course is about jesus christ what he did for us the acts of the apostles did you know that's what the book of acts was about is what they did operating in the word of god the power of god that jesus christ gave them when he raised up these apostles under him but there are some newer translations there's every kind of bible out there trust me even ones that are not good okay that you don't want to read and by the way this is for free also free tip do not read false religions words like their bibles like it's not wise to fill yourself with the quran it's not wise to read the book of mormon it is not wise at all to read the satanic bible none of these things are about false religions that do not believe in jesus christ his blood that he is the son of god or they leave out main events that are going to happen there will be a tribulation i've seen the timeline of god that's embedded in the floor behind his throne and these things are going to happen the millennial reign of christ which you could also say the thousand-year reign of jesus christ on this earth it will happen by the way that's quite a ways away from here i've been taking over 100 years into the future we're still here so that's also a free tip you're not going to be you're not going to be raptured out of here in the next few days or the next few years it's not going to happen in 10 20 30 40 50 60 i just could gone it's going to happen when the father decides what will happen but if you get a bible and it does not include major acts of god or events that god has already ordained will happen he needs these events to happen for his purposes don't read a bible that leaves major things out especially accountability especially where it talks about sin make sure that you repent of your sins there's all kinds of stuff going on and it's all kind of teachings literally in some churches they teach that you don't need jesus christ to go to heaven or that everyone's going to heaven no matter what they've done or the whole world's going to heaven i promise you the whole world's not going to heaven but you give yourself to jesus christ you find a word of god that is supposed to be like a plum line of decisions that you make sometimes it will help you learn how to pray how to develop an intimate relationship with jesus christ so i'm glad this question was asked so there are many different translations of what people call the bible and if they're not a whole word of god the whole new testament or the whole of you know the old testament or just both of them together that's not a truth that's not all the truth you find a word and you find the church that teaches the whole truth you can't leave the holy spirit out of your life he's the third member of the trinity he is god also so i can tell you right now the bibles i read have the whole council of god in them and i've talked so long i forgot what the original question was is it necessary to be water baptized and i didn't even answer that question and he just went out but that's okay i would have wheeled you back in when you were so worried you know why the word of god by the way it talks about being water baptized yes it's in the bible you give yourself to jesus christ repent of your sins okay because you're not going to heaven if you don't repent and i'll tell you why the father told me he's not letting evil wickedness and sin into heaven that's his home he said if i let everyone come to heaven without receiving my son heaven would be just like the earth and you don't want to live in eternity in the earth right you're going to live in heaven and i need to i need a break just a minute okay it is necessary to be water baptized because that is an outward representation that you gave yourself to jesus christ and when you do that it's like you died with him that's what it is when you get when he he he wipes away all of your sin and fills you with him okay water baptism is an outward expression that you received christ and your sins were wiped away so it's like you died and were resurrected with him in him and now he lives in you and that's what water baptism is that's why it is important to have it done however it's not going to keep you from going to heaven okay if you don't receive holy spirit of course that is such a power living in you he will become your best friend he is my best friend holy spirit is and and he tweaks me all the time he makes me laugh he shows me things to come he opens up the word of god how do you get him the same way you get christ you receive christ first and then you invite holy spirit to indwell you and let me tell you he's not going to say no so these are all a necessary process because when you get saved it's wonderful the salvation is free you have grace for eternal life your name is written in the lamb's book of life but it's important to do these other things because they increase your intimacy with christ they open up the knowledge and the understanding of god himself so water baptism is showing and let me tell you you don't have to do it in church a lot of churches have a baptismal they'll be glad to do that for you but i know people who've gotten baptized in horse troughs and swimming pools yeah one of my own dollars was baptized in the swimming pool at this private school that allowed everyone to come they had ceremonies and they did that they just baptized you in water and let me tell you the most important thing it says if you believe on jesus christ you shall be saved but being water baptized being filled with the holy spirit finding a good truth speaking church because it says to not forsake the gathering together of yourselves that means you can be part of a prayer group that means that someone who has a home church you can attend that some people watch church online and they give and tithe into that place wherever you are fed whatever feeds you in the word of god if there's somebody who does that whether it's a church a prayer group it could be a school of the spirit go where you can get more of god so it's not absolutely necessary because i will go back to the same thing that jesus said to the thief on the cross yay the thief on the cross the thief on the cross recognized that jesus christ was the son of god and he received him by the words he spoke to jesus himself remember me when you come into your kingdom remember me because he knew who he was but the other thief rejected him guess where that thief went okay this thief on the cross received jesus christ and christ answered him and said today you shall be with me in paradise now at that time when people who were accounted just and righteous because they they recognized god and received him then god kept them in a place in the earth called paradise it was down here it was a spiritual place a beautiful place so when abraham isaac jacob when all those great men women you know esther ruth when they passed they descended into paradise or abraham's bosom and it was not hell it was not hell that was for the wicked dead so i can tell you that because the thief on the cross he went and when and later on in that day this is when they're hanging on the cross this happened all right uh when they when the thieves died when they both died the one who rejected christ went into hell the other thief was in paradise when abraham's bosom which you know according to the word when christ's spirit man left the cross he descended into paradise or abraham's bosom he preached the gospel to all of them because according to them they their messiah had not come yet so you're getting a lot of scripture right now it's important to know this though so abraham isaac david all those righteous men um that would also be joseph you know the one who raised jesus these people before christ died on the cross ascended after he wiped up hell according to colossians he wiped up hell on the third day he spoiled and ruined prince valors and powers melted them okay and he took the keys of hell death and the grave from lucifer and then at that point christ rose up got his body back his physical body back so if you want to know is your spirit man busy can it see and hear and touch and feel christ did all those things in his spirit man descended into abraham's bosom saw the thief welcomed him greeted him like he said he would and then preach the gospel to all those who were there they were held captive in that place because heaven had to be chris had to pearl his blood on the altar in heaven and everyone sins from that point when they repented and you got forgiveness when you died from that point you just you ascended into heaven and abraham's bosom was cleaned out he led captivity captive and they all went up to heaven with christ so that changed everything that's why it was necessary so christ to do that so does that because this is another kind of you you answered someone's question i was going to ask okay but they just asked a further question um about paradise yeah so is it uh is it temporary or is it no longer existing paradise was like i said it was another word and it was called both places in the bible called it said abraham is more paradise it was the place where the those who were counted just and righteous by god because they believed in him and this is before christ came to the earth and died for us it was a place that was created so they had a place to stay and live there was buildings there was a river i've seen that place a beautiful place that god kept his that he counted as just and righteous it was emptied out when christ went there when his spiritual body left the cross and he went into abraham's bosom met actually he met in person abraham isaac jacob king david solomon adam was there the only ones not there were elijah and nina they actually were taken to heaven itself by by god the father he caught them up and took them in their physical bodies so they they were the only ones up in heaven besides all of the angels the living creatures um god you know the father or son holy spirit they all lived in heaven but after that happened it says in the word that people no longer descended they ascended christ descended for us and he cleaned that place out by preaching the gospel to them not hell okay he didn't go there to preach the gospel and then after he preached the gospel then he went over to hell christ did and then he was there and it says in the bible for three days he was there and then of course we know what happened on the third day and then christ after he was done wiping up hell taking the keys he went back up to the tomb got his physical body it was glorified instantly which is what we will experience on the day that dead and christ will rise our spirit men our spirit bodies have been living in heaven that's us will be rejoined with our physical body it will be glorified that means you can never sin never fall never die never get sick that you will be immortal it says mortality will take on immortality that's us we're mortals now we may be supernatural morals but to come a time in your life because of your receiving of jesus christ that you will be immortal and that's scriptural so there you go so it's empty abraham's bosom paradise is empty now there's no one yeah because when you die whoever owns you oh comes and gets you comes together and that's the best way the father said to me the first time i've got to heaven when you die whoever owns you will come for you so make sure you are praying for all of your loved ones who don't know christ because god gives us promises in the word and it says because we are believers who have received christ and bleed christ that there are things we can ask him if we don't doubt in our heart but believe what we say will come to pass then we will have whatsoever we say and the greatest thing you can do with that scripture is stand and say i stand for the salvation of my family members for all those who don't know christ i declare they will know him love and receive him and that we will be together for eternity that is a powerful declaration but once you've prayed that for them don't talk about how bad they are okay you don't want to do that that's like being double-minded if you're declaring they're going to know christ pray for them love them you may not be able to validate what they're doing don't validate their sin okay every time you see them love them and just tell them god loves them keep praying for them but it's a powerful prayer for a believer to stand for their family members because it says you and your household shall be saved and so that's because you know christ but uh so that answers that question very good um let's take a quick break oh yeah we want to uh tell everybody what we're going to show them yes we're going to take a little break and let you know we have some new things that we are going to we've been doing actually and one of them is called cat on the go and you become a part of my life where i'm going what i'm doing and we stop and make a little mini video and share that little piece of life so we're going to take a moment and let you see one right now hi everybody this is pat on the go and here i am say hi welcome hey everybody yeah we're very busy so we won't be talking to you very long but we're here discussing illustrations of the things that will become images in the resurrection movie is that right right it's exciting isn't it to be a part of it but it is a lot of work trust me it takes hours to do this you know we have to make sketches and he takes it makes it look amazingly beautiful okay i don't do that part he does and then we come back and there's edits and then he has to change things and i change things and he changes things but it's going to be amazing when it's all done and we can't we cannot we cannot wait to you know take that throne that throne that satan's been sitting on hollywood he's going down people going down god is taking it and we are doing this back again i hope you enjoyed that and so we did these cat on the gos different at different times on different days but you will enjoy every one of them so what is the next question um well this one's a bit of a tough subject and i the question flew by really fast so i didn't catch who asked it but um someone uh i think it was their nephew or something has recently committed suicide and they feel they're in heaven and um i didn't get to like i said i didn't get to read all of the question but what is god's say about that yes what does god say about when someone commits suicide so that is a very interesting question for me exciting but now you go that's just weird this is exciting not when god has caught you up on purpose to give you revelation yes and i have revelation on suicide i never knew my whole life now there were really strong christians i knew growing up and then later in life and they were going through a horrific struggles and they they ended their life and i inside knew that they were in heaven some of them i saw later in heaven and so the father on purpose said i'm going to show you the truth about suicide and he said first before i catch you up you're going to go to webster's dictionary and look up what it says about suicide and i was quite surprised because we all know people who do that what they call suicide what is called suicide people are either under horrific stress or trauma and it can be physical emotional or mental there's three areas in life where the enemy will just bombard you and crush you until you no longer can stand it and then people in their life take their life and everyone tags it suicide but god doesn't do that god is just and righteous so when i looked up the word suicide in the webster's dictionary it said someone who commits suicide is in their right mind with all of their senses they are knowledge of their mind their will and their emotions they know exactly what they're doing they're not in trauma or stress and they take their life and god said to me that would be like a terrorist or a suicide bomber there are people who plan on purpose in their right mind to on purpose die and most of the time our last time that is to hurt other people yeah like let's say um 9 11. okay all those people who are involved with the the death of all those people when those planes hit the buildings they knew their life would be taken that was suicide these people willingly knowingly got on those planes to on purpose go kill people and end many people's lives and that is called suicide what people this is the father speaking to me what people are experiencing they're not ending their life they can't bear the pain they're in whether it's mental emotional or physical sometimes people are in accidents the pain has agony the medicines sometimes the medicines even will give you thoughts of suicide and some people just can't no longer handle the suffering and god said they don't want to take their life or end their life they're ending their suffering and he said to me i would be unjust especially if this person had received my son and they couldn't handle the suffering they were ending the suffering he said i do not send those people to hell and i do not call that suicide and so therefore that is a very important answer and the first time i released that people were in shock but it makes sense because if somebody knew christ but then some tragedy happened to them whether physical mental or emotional that wasn't even their fault and they couldn't bear the suffering so they all they want to do is go home to heaven this does not give you excuse because you're going through a hard time to to take your life to go to heaven that's not right but people who are in agony on strong medications going through trauma's therapy you know when they get to the point where they cannot handle living they end their suffering and after he taught me that he took me to heaven and showed me three different people and i think it's even in one of my books where he talks about this whole thing about ending your suffering or taking your life there's a difference so you know a terrorist suicide person someone like that that is suicide but someone who's ending their suffering because of the trauma even some children do it teenagers older people people every age suffer but this is the good news if at any time when they were still in the right mind if you can get them to choose to lose i was just going to say i will tell you god was so adamant about this that he told me i'm going to put despair on you for a week and you will not be able to bear it and people go why would he do that so i would totally understand what people are feeling when they get to that point and he said right before suicide there is despair despair when you get into despair there's no hope no way out it's absolute agony in your mind to even exist and he said i'm going to put i'll let you experience it and he he literally put despair on me and for a week i would go climb in my car this was years and years ago he did this and i would all i would do is cry out to him i couldn't bear it i let me tell you i couldn't think right my emotions were a mess physically i had no energy i couldn't even think of a way out but i knew in my mind this was something god was letting me experience i think it's the only way i actually survived it at the end of the seven days he just came and took it off and joy and celebration flooded myself he said i don't want you to ever forget that is what people experience when they go through oppression depression deep depression then there is a spirit of depression on people and then there's despair after despair gets in then that's when the suicidal thoughts start coming people need to not keep that in them that's why he tells me god says don't even let sadness be in you do not let sadness rule your life most of the time you don't even know why you're sad you need to say i choose as an act of my will to lose all sadness all oppression all depression [Music] all despair and for some people you need to say this i lose every suicidal thought from me i will not keep it in my soul and then you say and i choose with my will to bind the life of god the love of god the presence of god his joy his celebration those i bind to my soul and no one can take them from you i hope this really helps somebody today but it does give hope for all those if your family member was in agony in the end of their suffering i promise you and especially if you made a stand for them to know christ they will be in heaven this is the hope we have and a promise we have from jesus christ and people tell me sometimes you don't talk about jesus he is my everything he is my number one my husband is my number two and that's not ever going to be changed don't run out in the spirit and become so supernatural to signs and wonders and forget who gave you the right to do that we can't go through this life and be successful and happy if you do not make jesus christ your number one before you start looking for someone else to fill a void in your life make sure jesus is there first so i think we're probably going to have to end this i might take one more question quick one one more question and then we have to go on to something else this is from i hope i'm saying this right it's um karina and she would like to know if you have any insight on tattoos this is another good one i love these ones i have revelation on because you know um earthwise time i've been around for a while may not look like it and i think like a child because the more i know god the more i act like one and think like one but for years i was told that tattoos were a sin a crime against god a blaspheme in leviticus it talks about them it says you shall not mark yourself and so people let me give you the revelation god gave me that scripture was talking about the culture of that day this is in the old testament in leviticus in the old testament it said you shall not mark yourself with the marks of the dead now in some of the new translations they may have changed that scripture or say you will not have tattoos on you but that's wrong because that's not the great translation god does mark people himself as invisible was a tattoo it is a visible permanent mark he marked cain in the bible remember that when he had even killed label but so people would not kill cain god put a mark on him letting people know do not kill him that was a permanent visible mark in the bible it says some people will mark me mark me put my marks on them and so there are people who have a permanent visible mark on them we in this time and age we call that tattooing and let me tell you even in heaven when you get there it says god will put his mark in your forehead the name of the city of your god will be put a permanent visible mark in your forehead and it will be put in the palm of your hand this is in the word of god people so heaven puts permanent marks on you it also says in the bible that god will mark 144 000 jews that will do powerful things for him in the last day so what are you going to say to those people you can't go to heaven because you have those marks on you there will be people that will put marks on their self because god has even asked them they will not represent hell okay these marks cannot represent hell because what you put on you says who you serve yeah and so that part is very important as signs of things that represent death or hell should not be put on your body and if you had that done a long time ago i would encourage you to go back and have them changed i do know that it's possible i do know this in this great move of god coming where the fire of god will be loosed over people he will actually erase a lot of the other kind of tattoos off of you but you cannot put that as something you can't just put in a box because that scripture in leviticus says in the culture of that day they were marking themselves with satanic marks all kinds of people back in the way back in the day in the old testament they were cutting themselves and cutting off parts of their body and giving them to idols worshiping idols okay it also says you should not cut yourself uh you should not worship a false god all this was the culture that was taken place back in the old testament in this in the leviticus in those days so but it does say you should not mark yourself with the marks of the dead i will also add this if you're young and you are still living under the covering of your parents don't run out and get one just because i said that to you when you are on your own if you want to have something that represents heaven revelation that is going to be your own decision when you're out on your own but don't do something that's going to call cause grief in your family or strife in your family okay make sure that that is going to be okay with with god and if you're under your parents you honor your father and your mother and let me tell you i always did that and if god ever tells me to get one i'm going to wear it i keep saying i may get it i'll make it if you got better on my face it'd probably be would we a wing of the living creature with eyes in it or something but right now i'm not planning that but i need to give you truth and that is true that marking yourself in today's world they would call that a tattoo it doesn't it's not all jesus has wrong jesus himself has on his entire thigh has written a permanent visible mark that says he is the king of kings those are spiritual kings and the lord of lords so our own lord and savior has that mark on him and god has used it in the past and present okay to let people know they live for me they represent me so go you be powerful re please run after jesus christ first get revelation ask for revelation yourself and we're going to end our session right now so that i can go and do something our q a session and go into something else and i hope you have a blessed day and i release the life of god in part the life of god the joy of the lord in jesus name and so we're going to go on to our next session yeah we're just going to switch we're going to switch topics right now and we're going to talk about the guardian zone yay we love our guardian and we love this because this is a plan that god gave us again the things that we do no matter what those things are if god creates an event through us or a move of god he's starting he has us make a mark or a logo for it because he's marking it as his it will cause a move of god with whatever that purpose is and we love it when he does that and for years because my book was actually written in 2005 2006 my first book and he gave me a deadline to have it published by may of 2007 and it was i actually met that deadline and it wasn't easy because i still lived with all of with my family my my mom my mom my sisters a couple of my sisters lived with us my niece my daughters my husband and i we all have one big home together and i had to write that book in the midst of that so all you people that god have asked you to write you don't have an excuse you find time you do it he wants that he needs that message given to people whether it's just to make people laugh to give them a revelation on how to do any ideas and inventions let's say it's uh it's powerful revelation on the word itself uh maybe a prophetic book about things to come you have to step out and start that book and i had to write it we're living with all of that stuff going on in my own home it was never quiet i never had any really quiet time and it's a good thing i do stay up and my my greatest creative time is from midnight to 4 a.m is when i in those hours that's when i wrote all my books just when i do all my sketches most all of them are done during that time and so sometimes you just have to find a way to do it by the way at our our events we have different events and heavens invitation this is going to be for free right now heaven's invitation is coming up in june and we will have a pr a free author how to become a published author or self-published author workshop and when you can get something for free that is a good thing and there are different methods that you can use to write and you stick to that protocol but let me tell you only 10 of all books that are started ever get published and it is possible to get published so i want to encourage you in that moment but i'm going to talk about the guardian zone and the holy spirit and the father dropped this in my spirit and we actually designed a logo several years ago which represented the guardian zone and and that image that you're going to see or you are seeing right now it represents two flows something is flowing in so it can flow out so as the support and supply comes in that's your giving then the revelation can go out and what people do when they join the guardian zone you're a member but we call you a guardian how about that god does love to give titles i know man talks about not having titles but god is really big on giving titles to people especially in these powerful days we're in now so you will become a guardian by your continual support in giving your financial giving and we actually have people right now on phones that you can call this very moment and they will answer the phone they take down your information and how you would like to give it it doesn't matter if it's weekly monthly you know it can be annually whatever but most people choose to give monthly or or weekly whatever god puts in your heart to give whatever is in there to give it it helps us to release more revelation like the studio it costs money okay it costs money and you'd be surprised probably if you've never done it what it costs to do things like this because we have really good cameras now we have professional lights we have an awesome media desk let me tell you what my one sister my one sister hello patty uh paid for this media desk knowing what would be used for she will get reward because of purchasing this for so we could have a professional looking desk to do all of our media and our broadcast we're going to be doing webinars really they are going to be coming up we're going to do webinars we're going to do all kinds of things from here we will actually have weather warriors weather broadcast we have a green screen that's uh we're setting all that up so we can do stuff with the green screen and there'll be a point where we do weather warriors and you literally will see on the green screen the weather the destructive weather or the threat of it you'll see it on the green screen and as we're declaring and decreeing over you may see things changed immediately or we will come back the next day and show you the actual thing that happened let's just say a big tropical storm is coming and it was building and growing it was really getting bad and we all take authority over that in our with our weather warriors group from all over the world now we have people in every country now that do this um and it's gonna be powerful and by the way i might as well just tell you we are planning a webinar for weather warrior training instead of making everybody come here to do that we're already working on setting all that up sometime in the spring i can't give you a date at this moment but we will have a webinar it will cost a small fee because we will need people to be here that aren't normally here we'll have all kinds of other stuff that we'll have to have and things going on it will not be very much but let me tell you it's cheaper than flying getting a hotel and having to sit and wait in between the events it will be powerful focused training on how to be a weather warrior and you will be so filled with it and trained with it no matter what comes up anywhere and if you see or hear something coming up in the world that is destructive you should take authority over it because you're over the weather not under it so there's my free clip that's just one of the things that some of our funds are used for and some of these funds that people are you're giving right now that's what the guardian zone is is helping to support heaven's plan to release heaven on earth and create products that represent heaven on earth and put them in the marketplace and you have to supply for me because i don't get a big check from a church somewhere you know i love church by the way i'm going to give a plug to church god is not abandoning the church he's going to settle set it free the ones who are teaching deception like it's okay to send all you want to you that's called deception uh pray for those people but don't stay there okay the church is the way god designed so that we could all have members to be together to fellowship together to break bread together and to help each other it's very important we have many revivals in the past it wouldn't have been possible if people in churches involved in church were not there and so i do know there's a lot of home churches as many new ways god is doing things we're in a new time in the spirit realm and in god's plan so i'm all for home churches churches and offices these are people who teach the word they they pray for people they have prayer groups intercessory groups schools of the spirit now schools of the supernatural it's just exploding everywhere so there's many ways to get to know god get more of god but these funds that you give us help to provide provide for me personally and to help take revelation places we never could do it before and it helps us to put new materials out there for people so i really appreciate every person and many people have responded to become a guardian and i'm just going to share a little bit the numbers are on the screen right now to call and like i said we actually have staff right now waiting to take down your information if you'd like to become a member of the guardian zone and you don't want to go online yourself to do it you can actually call and they can take all your information and they will sign you up in the guardian zone and then what you're going to get is i send revelation reports to you at different times throughout the year i have special gifts that are being designed as tokens of our appreciation that you will receive and every year you will get towards the end of the year you'll get a real beautiful collectible item from my heart to yours and you will have god's blessings on you because this is heaven's plan and so uh people have all kinds of questions sometimes about this god is not against people giving especially if it's his plan and it helps those who are pouring out their life to do what god is asking and if people around this world weren't willing to give their life to christ not just receive christ but spend their life giving the truth praying for people i know powerful men and women of god that are out there right now around the world helping people and giving to them if they're doing that is a god thing people complain about paying tithes or giving offerings or you know the bible is free the bible itself isn't free actually unless you go to a group like maybe the salvation army the gideons you probably can get a free bible but all these bibles are being the wonderful ones filled with truth have all kinds of helps in them and things that people spent a lot of their life doing translations in different languages for different purposes we probably eventually i don't know when we'll probably have a revelation bible filled with revelation on the word of god itself and the times and all those things right now he's got me on many different platforms doing things but i can tell you those who are doing it and then they put that in the bookstore to be sold you cannot walk in a bible bookstore and just take products out of there and walk away and say i'm taking these free it's like going to anyone who has their business and this is how they make their money and i want you to know that even jesus made money on this earth he had a business he was a carpenter he didn't give it away for free that was his living paul worked with fabrics and i know he did make tents but he also made banners and all kinds of beautiful things he made a living even while he was ministering and when christ was ministering i'm sure there was a point where he did stop doing that but it's okay to be in business and minister also at the same time and so you go to the store and you go to places all the time to spend your money you're getting what you paid for but here when we do things like this and every day we're putting stuff out there i i believe right now there's probably 500 hours on youtube of me talking about heaven on every kind of subject possible and that we do not charge for that we don't charge of course for facebook uh all the stuff we put out there when i go and speak you know when i go places i'm invited to speak sometimes they have to charge a fee because they have to run to place they have to pay security they have to pay the ushers they have to pay people to come and be a part of that and so i can hear the phones ringing right now that makes me very happy but even ourselves in our own events that we hold every single year we will not ever charge people to attend those events that means that we are taking on all the expense and i'm just going to give you a tip because some people never know if somebody goes and they're going to hold a big event like in a hotel unless it's a three-day event and it's a major hotel they could be paying 20 000 to rent the space in that hotel because this is the hotel's property you also bring most of the time your own equipment like your speakers your microphone your technical technical stuff you have to carry and take it into these places people are really blessed if they find a church that might let them rent the church to have a meeting and so that's probably a little bit less expensive but i know we ourselves in the past we would pay like twelve hundred dollars a day to be at the marriott those meetings we held there they weren't free for us but we didn't charge anyone that's something god ask of me personally so our main events which would be heaven's invitation that's heaven inviting you to get revelation that's always in june okay then we have the dread champions that is the manifested sons of god that is for men and older teens teenagers boys uh that is just for them and they have powerful events with the men and then we have the wonder women that is our all women event and i can tell you what we shake hell we shake hell we send the armies of heaven all over the world we had people women from 40 almost 40 different places i'm talking about countries that come to these events it's always going to be usually the first weekend in november and so uh we are already putting stuff out there to save the save the date for these meetings that are coming up we're already making major plans for them and of course weather warriors will also be an annual event and uh like i said we're we are right now creating a webinar where we can do that and people from all over the world will be able to join on that webinar we will get the dates to you as soon as we have it all set up like i said there'll be a small fee you you'll pay that to join us you'll be given a special link to go to so that you can watch it and only the people who up who will sign up for that event for that webinar they will be able to see it and be trained powerfully it will be over the course of two days that we will have that this is something new for us but we will begin if i mentor my mentoring in the future will only be done the webinar so it's going to be very powerful that we have this source of media to use so i'm just giving you some tips on what do we do with that money okay i am not just by myself i'm not sitting here alone by myself i have staff all around me i have staff in the other rooms of our office right now one day we will have a huge place because god has already shown me that and i do know what will happen and eventually we will have staff and facilities around this world but this is where we are starting okay uh my my family you know we still live here because right now this is where god has us so it's like we're in our office 24 hours a day that's what it feels like sometimes and so it powerfully helps us you know god blesses us and the word talks about giving offerings and sharing i don't usually go into that part of it it's what is in your heart if you receive revelation if it has changed your life we will eventually one day actually have a program that does nothing but share testimonies from around this world of how revelation has changed their life it's the more of god it comes from his self it's from his throne and we love sharing that a lot of my staff learn to adapt to heaven culture that's what we call it and we explain in many of my messages out there you learn how to live heaven culture you learn how to take authority you learn how to work with the army of heaven you are trained because it is our job the bible says that the fifo ministry is here to train you we're not supposed to just share a few good words and sing a couple nice songs you need to lead changed okay we go from glory to glory by getting more of god and then applying it if you receive if you go to church you get a powerful message and they give things to inspire you and to help you that means you apply it to your life and so i tell people i'm not here just to talk to you i'm here to help change you and trust me until you are walking in the spirit okay that means your flesh has died to itself when you walk in the spirit it blesses the heart of god but your life begins to be it's like you breathe him in and you breathe him out walking in the spirit brings life okay it even says that in the word of god walking in the spirit is not partnering with hell not tolerating hell in your life all that stuff is true in the bible there is a hell i have been there and seen it there certainly is a literal heaven i've been there and seen it many times and god has powerful things for us right now in this slide so make sure you call the number on there and you join the guardian zone i will so appreciate it you can go online we do have a website you can go to if you're if you're if you're technology based you certainly can go to catker.com and you click on the treasury and then you choose the guardian zone this is the way you yourself you can go on there and fill out all the information choose when you want to give how much you want to give and then that will be done for you so there is an online way to do it and believe it or not people who do nothing but live in technology don't understand there are actually many many people still in this world that don't even own a computer that wouldn't know how to operate a computer some of them actually don't have cell phones is that wild so not everyone is buddies carrying around their tablet or their ipad totally connected to the world that way there's still old school people around and there probably always will be i know technology is changing everything and we have to move with all of that but but this is a way that you can give the guardian zone is helping to support heaven's plan and i appreciate it so much that you choose to join um we had a couple people ask if they want to send it by mail okay where so i posted the p.o box address okay but can you explain to them i will explain i need to make the chat yeah so we're going to talk just a minute about how you give like i was just saying that everybody can go online and give that way you can send your amount through the mail you can send to stuff to us i think they have right now got the po box we have a p.o box you can send stuff to you if you want to send your weekly or monthly or whatever it is where you choose to give you can send it to that special p.o box please write on the envelope now you can put my name because and let me tell you this the checks have to be made up to me personally we have a business also so the business cannot receive donations okay they can't and i am not a 501c3 this is some more news for you i cannot give you a tax deductible receipt but in the bible of course it does talk about giving it gives gives offering you give offerings you give to help the poor you can give ties i am definitely all for tithing god didn't do away with tithing either and like i said that is given to whoever it is that feeds you with the word of god in the holy spirit but you can send through the mail a check a money order make sure you make it out to cat curve and in the four section at the bottom make sure you write guardian zone gift it is a gift and like i said you'll become a member of the garden zone on the outside envelope it really helps us if you put it on there so we don't have to try to call you and say is this a guardian's own gift so right guardian zone if you don't want to write all that out write g capital g capital z gift where it says 4 on your check or your money order please write that in there but if you can remember somewhere on your envelope you can also write the guardian zone so we know automatically when it comes to the mail because yes you can do that we have a database that we have specifically created we will not share the information that you give us and so

and i was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it looked like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause their soul to prosper all the time and then they'll live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering here so cat um well those of you who don't know the lord's been taking her to heaven for several years and showing her things and bringing her back and allowing her to share with us so let's just welcome cat kerr [Applause] your soul is one of the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well i'm this and that no adam became a living say it loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to god that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life is probably one of the least talked about things in the church is a soul growing up i always heard that it was bad went but god made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul how why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with god and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your soul is fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody can wound and hurt you and it stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand i was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time i never usually know but i looked at my clock and i was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it looked like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause their soul to prosper all the time and then they'll live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that word be means live it's called divine health so i since i learned about this the father taught me about that he said people can lose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you lose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can lose from your soul and he said i know most people bind the devil with the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talk about the loosing thing what are you going to do with the leucine key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of god to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about god will never be taken from you and so people i know you know you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it i'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to lose that that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out say what's loose on earth is loose in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of god as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're going to do a soul checkup i hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming i hope you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're going to do some spiritual warfare with the host they'll be excited you may leave with an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're going to have some fire sent the angels already outside waiting but they're going to do that tomorrow night i did this recently where i mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time to start getting i want to say drops of it the fire of god is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our god is a consuming fire i'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of christ send the fire i want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart i mean literally makes your your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with god the fire it burns it out and then he puts himself in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from god too stones of fire i find in one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that satan left on some other planet was in the bible and i already knew what they were so god made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is i'm like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to lucifer okay they were inside god or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the river of life that's in him the river flows out of him the gems

good morning everybody [Music] this is almost my morning [Laughter] how many people don't know me or know anything about me anybody got dragged here [Laughter] i'm so glad you're here i prayed for you a long time ago that people would understand heaven is different they live differently there uh hair color is heaven culture i didn't ask for this i am not a paint care person well i am now but years ago when the lord came to me in person because even as a child i would say if jesus ever comes to me in person and asks me to do something there's no way i'm not saying yes this is like an eight-year-old okay so i was strange even back then i've been a seer my whole life i was born with that gift that does not belong to the enemy most people when you mentor mention the seer or the spirit realm they think you're part of the new age movement no it was around long before the new age movement was here okay it belongs to god it's sent from heaven he needs seers on this earth and he needs prophets that are seers more than anything else because we say what we see whatever he takes us and shows us the difference between a prophet and the seed of prophet is we actually get to see what he's saying not just hear him say it therefore we give details and i can assure you what i say to you today will be things he told me or showed me or both and maybe things you never heard of before or even thought of before but i speak on behalf of heaven on this earth that is my commission it's not my gift my gift my passion is photography so you see before you a photographer minding her own business which is now god's business remember when jesus said i must be about the father's business remember when he said that i understand what he meant when he said that okay because he had the life of a carpenter correct say amen he was sent is a carpenter corrupt right he was then as a businessman and he knew who he was long before he got to that place of being a businessman god loves business people because they have openings that a lot of people who are in you know if they're christian leaders or in any way associated with a christian i don't like to say religious because god's not religious he wants a relationship with you and even that is sometimes new to people that never heard that man man created religion christ created a relationship he died for every single person right on the planet he didn't die just for a denomination and saying that i was part of the assemblies of god almost all of my entire life and grew up in that atmosphere which was awesome we had holy spirit we had the gifts working we had miracles we sent missionaries all over the world i helped to serve at our family church not my dad's church but it was our family's church i'm from a family of 15 children i'm number three that means i died a long time ago i also can read your thoughts just a tip i belong to jesus christ since i was four years old that was well over 60 years ago i forget how old i am because i don't look at age god counts time by events and so he chose me for a certain time on this earth to do things and say things for him i never asked to be caught up to heaven he decided that i was going to be a photographer i was going to work in business i loved working with ceos for over 25 years i was working in business he took me out of that at one point in my life and he said i'm gonna prepare you for what is coming and the next season of your life he didn't say it would be to be caught up to having non-stop to give revelation on what heaven is like i would have done it anyway because by that time i was besotted with him i sought him earnestly on purpose fiercely for over 20 years now remember i was born again at four this is when i'm into my 20s by this point in my life and in my 30s i really passionately and i raised three children i'm married there's my husband of 43 years sitting right there y'all pray for him okay he has to live with me i'm not normal [Laughter] you can't be normal when you've been to heaven as many times as i have been there this is not really reality to me standing here this is a vapor in time your life right now is a vapor in time your future is going to be so powerful and great and grand and i'm not just talking about when you get to heaven i'm talking about because of the time you live in right now one of the most amazing fascinating powerful times to be alive on the earth is actually right now and anytime god before he did something great the enemy showed up to try to steal that time the enemy wants his time his time is not yet and the father would tell me all the time he's only given satan a bump in the road that's what he calls the tribulation in the paris times and there's people now even saying they're not going to have that they're wrong i've seen god's timeline part of it and he is going to have those things happen for his own purposes he needs them to happen in the earth they'll be for a short time but the times we're entering into now will be for generations maybe you didn't think that again i've seen 50 to 100 years into the future and the mere perilous times had not happened the tribulation had not happened and i think it would be better if we stop saying he's going to come tomorrow i will say he's going to come when the father tells him to is the correct thing to say christ is coming back i absolutely believe in the rapture i absolutely believe that those times will happen but those aren't these times we haven't even done the works alone the greater works christ passionately said certain things would happen and some of them haven't even happened he's not willing to wrap it up and end it in the midst of darkness amen things are getting greater and greater and more and more powerful in these days we literally will learn to rule like christ did in the earth the bible clearly says don't tell me what the word says i know what it says people better know what it says it says we will rule and reign with christ now say now and in the time to come we will that's who we are we have authority as believers if you're not a member of the body of christ you have no authority you have no authority over satan you have no authority in the spirit realm you have no authority to speak for god if you're not belong to jesus christ and you have not had your sins washed away you are not righteous i hope you say amen god does not agree with it's okay to sin all the time whenever you feel like it that's right god does not agree with once you get saved and if you if you sin and keep on sinning the grace will cover it that's only if you repent that's what the word says is that correct christ is righteous and just if you repent of your sins he will cleanse you from all unrighteousness is that what that says that means when you sin say you're not saved when you sin something happens in your soul when i have you say it that's why i do that when you sin that makes you unrighteous when you repent he wipes it away and you are righteous i just as blunt as i can be i i love the truth i live by the truth i have to myself it doesn't matter that he catches me up to heaven all the time shows me mysteries takes me into the past takes me into the future i know what his heart is i know what his words are i know what his ways are i walk in them i know his will is not always what ours is the best way you can live is his will his way not his will your way he he desires so much for us to attain to everything that christ won for us this is one of those times where we're going to rise above our lives and all the way we've been living in the past that doesn't mean he won't desire holiness in our life that means we'll be doing things we never dreamed we would be doing and therefore when he's going to do something like that he has to clean the platform off a platform of man that platform of the enemy and crush the enemy and push him back so that we will have freedom to move around this earth not just in this country which by the way will be absolutely not just restored but almost reborn this is not the time for america to go down the tube and end we are this is what the father says you are a baby country you're still a baby you have begun to walk in all that i desire and i created you to do in this earth you are it will be a great light to this world a place where people can come to know my son a place where they can walk in the glory that is created by those who love me a place where people come to see the miraculous as a normal way of life amen a place will come to america not to find the american dream but define me a place where prosperity will happen because two-thirds of the gospel has been paid for by people from this country i am not going to ignore the cries or the prayers of my people they are precious to me they allow me to give me permission to move and operate on their behalf and even over those who would take steal and try to steal cheat and steal and take this country away if you're interested the father calls biden a villain you should say amen a villain in any movie is the worst people who promotes and carries out evil deeds and the father is well aware of everything that's going on behind the barbed wire and he's not going to tolerate it because of the importance of these days for god for his son for holy spirit in this earth and especially particularly a miracle because it helps others know and learn about jesus christ and let me tell you that is not going to stop happening they have carried the message of the gospel of the kingdom they will now begin to carry the knowledge and the power of the glory he is not going to give up his time for the glory to be seen and known in this world there's actually scriptures written about the glory of god the number one is christ in you is the hope of glory do you know what that means that means you will begin to create glory for god and you will carry that glory amen literally the light of god will come from you that scripture also means that you will release that glory and operate in that glory how do you think the knowledge of it is going to go around this world we will demonstrate it things beyond your imagination are the days we're stepping into because of that god won't even send new creations and inventions to this earth because he's not willing for the wicked you have them say amen he's well aware of everything that's going on he's not oblivious to it it's not that he doesn't care he does care he just has a plan amen and it may not line up with man's dates that they keep trying to give that he's going to do something they were all wrong or he would have done it he won't even give me a date he'll say i'm going to do this and i'll say god's going to do this it doesn't bother me that it doesn't happen for a year or several months or even weeks i've waited 45 years before for him to do something he promised me and i never gave up and he did it amen my family understands faith we lived by faith god was welcome in our home so his holy spirit so was jesus christ he was our healer you got 15 kids you need jesus as your healer from being shot point blank with a shotgun to being bit by deadly spiders from being hunted by people kidnapped and then brought back we stood in faithful albums and every one of them we had victory why can i not stand for a few months to see god act in my country and in my nation this is not just about america this is about the whole world right now he is exposing evil all over the world in great detail and most people will be shocked and i promise you you will know what was going on you actually see the evidence hear the hear hear the testimonies see the videos of the horrific things that have been already got they already have the evidence right now this moment i'm standing here they have the evidence and i will promise you this trump is our president if you don't want that you need to lose something out of your soul because you're fighting against god not trump god picked somebody who couldn't be bought who couldn't be forced who couldn't have fear put in them who could not be controlled he picked him on purpose and he picked a businessman he has already proven himself that he loves this country and he loves the people in this country and there's actually you should know by now persecution comes because the enemy doesn't like certain things the persecution is the proof that you're going to get what you ask for you have properties and lands and blessings in this life with what say persecution you should always rejoice when persecution comes that means you're doing exactly what god wants [Applause] it's really evidence i rejoice i compass and say man you should be rejoicing and dancing you've got all that persecution you're going to get something great from god and he never saw it that way i said that's how jesus seems he wasn't concerned at all about persecution he didn't care that the religious hierarchy didn't like him he was a threat to them he was also a character when he walked in this earth he was funny people loved to be with him even sinners i'm sure he captivated them in revelation they never expected to hear they heard words they never heard before and it made them burn inside people burn in heaven because of the revelation they live in in the parts of god they see you never got to see they get to see parts of the future they get to see parts of the new earth they saw how things were done by god way in the past before even the physical realm was created your family members are living in the greatest place possible they are happy they're rejoicing they're blessed beyond measure they have mansions no human hands can afford to build your mama and your dad your grandparents great grandparents don't want to come back not because they don't love you but they're one of the one who loves them the most you can have the understanding of that love it makes it a lot easier to live in this world when you see it through christ's eyes when he was on that cross dying for all of us and he understood that people didn't understand they didn't have a clue the ones who were even reviling against him at that point he died anyway didn't he what little is it to us to die to our flesh sometimes if we have a choice to be kind to someone even if they're being mean to us it's one of the greatest things you can do to pierce the enemy you pierce the heart of the enemy when you love instead of fighting back against people when you're kind even when you're spent is fought upon or mistreated or wrongfully accused when you choose to love doesn't mean you're just being foolish it means you're piercing the enemy your worship also pierces the enemy it goes right through the second heaven maybe you didn't know about that satan has built his own little tiny tiny kingdom up there he sits on a throne of skulls and he rules from up there because he's a prince in power in the air so he can do things in the spirit realm the spirit realm is both both sides are there all the time this is not heaven all right you're not living in heaven right now we're having more heaven sent down than ever before that heaven is not deserved and neither is hell heaven is beyond your imagination with the glory with the beauty the splendor the creativity the wonder of being there in his presence all the time with him you ride on your worship across the skies of heaven into the throne room you're transported through beams of light from one side of heaven to the other the food is everywhere there's no weight gain or food allergies on heaven everyone is young there is no age there is no time there's amazing fun exciting things to do because the father is a father it says you must be like a little child because when you get there you're going to be shocked to see how many fun things he made for you [Music] you may be 90 now but you feel like you're 9 when you get there there's laughter everywhere in heaven people love it it is love because he's there and he chose this time not us many people are in fear they shouldn't be if they belong to him he actually said i have not given you a spirit of fear but of power say power i want you to notice that's the number one thing he says has given us he gives us power that power he gives us as a believer is over all the power of the enemy that means no matter what's going on around us we have authority to speak against that you have authority to speak against anything the enemy is doing to you because jesus gave us that every demon should run in fear when you get up in the morning hell should tremble when you open your mouth and speak things to people amen because you have authority in your mouth you have the word of god you have the power of god you have the life of god you get revelation you have you have his plans his will for your life he chose you and put you on the earth that's why you're here right now no matter who you were birthed out of you were birthed from him first and he went down his timeline and chose when you would be here because he needs you here so these days are going to be different than anything we've ever lived before i've already seen these days i've seen well into the next 50 years that should be normal so i have no fear of anything he holds my life in his hand and the father holds the breath of every being on this earth and there are some so wicked he said all i have to do is remove it and they're out there are some very wicked people in this world right now they may not live through this yes god has done that before in the past he wiped everybody off the earth it was so wicked as bad as it is right now it is not as bad as it was to the tase of noah i know people think it is but it's not it's i'm not i talk about those horrific things that they did back then but there are people wicked enough to want that to happen and the thing is when the enemy finds enough and he's actually found a lot of humans who are willing to do things his way but the enemy's already lost because this is not his time even when it is his time he's not going to get what he wants because even those who are believers at the time of the tribulation and the parasites will be some of the strongest believers ever walked on this earth they won't even be afraid to die i know i've seen the movies from the time i was young i've seen the movies about you know during those days how bad it will be uh nobody will be forced to take the mark the mark is not the michael chip you can't see it that mark satan's going to put on people will be seen three blocks away because he's full of himself and he wants people to know who gave themselves to him so that won't be something that is forced on anybody he wants people to willingly do that and right now he's found a lot of willing people but it's still not the time for him to have authority in this earth therefore god is going to take and wipe the platform clean not just in america but he will remove evil from many different places and high authority and leadership in many different countries around this world i know everybody said well we're going to have the harvest it still won't be the final harvest the first waves of harvest we get those people need to be mentored to walk in the supernatural and learn how to roll with jesus christ so we don't know how to do that how are we going to mentor them we can't be normal we cannot be normal you can't live your life every day like it's the same you live your life with passion and excitement that we've been given great authority actually he gave us the earth amen we are stewards of this earth we're stewards of what goes on around here and god said i will allow what you allow i will not allow what you don't allow that's also in the bible so why are we allowing things everything you say from your mouth is written down you should go back and read the scripts i started counting my words a long time ago because i see scribe angels writing things down about ten years ago i woke up and there were two things sitting on the end of my bed and then one scribe angel looked at me said we have been sent for the words of all the leaders in the body of christ at this point now we will write down everything they say whether in public or in private and from those words are speaking god will decide who will have a leadership in these great end days and who will not have leadership those who will operate in power and authority those who will not allow to operate in power and authority if there's sin in their lives they will not be allowed to operate not in these greater days of glory he said people can fake many things they can fake being in the five-fold ministry they can fake by things they say and yet they're sinning behind the scenes but god sees everything that's right he's not watching you to hit you over the head with something he's watching you to see what is in your heart what do you desire to do for others that thing to esteem others more highly than yourself goes a long way in heaven i was raised that way my dad was raised that way i'm from seven generations of believers who actually believed i was the one who didn't want to be known or seen by anybody i was not someone who would put pink in my hair was the quiet one watch out for the quiet ones they're thinking and they're watching all the time i can just tell you god had a plan for my life i had a little plan i was going to get me a nice apartment and be in some big company because i loved working in business i'd like to see things happen and god had another plan no i'm going to give you pink hair i'm going to take you up to have a non-stop and you're going to go all over the world and speak to everybody you're going to hug them and let them kiss you on the cheek if they want to i was not a person that wanted to be hugged or kissed by anybody and yet i mean been kissed thousands of times by people around the world you know greet each other with a brotherly kiss that kind of a kiss so he's changed me he's changed the way i think the way i look at people i look at him through his eyes he loves you more than you ever ever can imagine no matter who you are even what you've done even with your failures with your mistakes things that you gave up on he has not given up on you and he has not given up on this country amen he has repeatedly told me america is not evil it isn't america itself is not it's one nation under god and he says that to me all the time it's my country it's mine and he said in 2015 i put my hand on the country and i turned that map red and he had already declared that trump would be president for eight years knowing every single thing that would happen and god says oh no he means right now not talking about in 2024 he's talking about right now he said to me trump won the election he didn't lose that makes him president the other side lied and cheated that disqualifies them he said if in the olympics they are caught cheating they are not congratulated they are not honored they're not rewarded they are removed and they have absolute all the proof they need that that happened just because the civil courts wouldn't hear the cases doesn't mean justice is not coming and i can promise you trump knows all of this he's not been lazy he's been very busy behind the scenes so are many other smart smart and intel smart people around the world that know what is right and what is not right and they don't need any more evidence than they have to take all of them to prison or be shot for treason these i'm speaking truth not making it up this is true trump is still our president he won the election uh on the election date and when they said we're going to stop the counting the holy spirit who is right beside me said that's really going to cheat and steal and change all the votes he said that to me right when they said those words we're going to stop the voting we'll pick it up tomorrow and then we'll see what happens well by that time almost 80 million people had already voted for trump yes and if you'll notice you never saw biden's people he never had rallies because he had no people but they didn't know what they were going to do they knew from the beginning they would cheat they already had their plans laid out that all those the voting machines and the dominion system already working on their behalf and i know most of you weren't aware of that but they switched so many votes overnight that before trump can switch them to biden and finally there's one county that is given permission to recount have 2.1 million of the ballots looked at individually all over again to make sure that they were counting but that's still not how he's going to be put back in office there's already things that have happened even in our military i will tell you this that the ones who are sitting there illegitimately god says are illegitimate in in dc he says the ones behind barbed wire that's how he talks about him [Music] are still hoping we will give up and let them do what they want to and this is what the father says there was a couple things they never considered when they plotted this whole thing together with the intel you know with the wicked rich with the fake news media i mean there's so many that are going to be probably be either put in prison lose what they have built up lose their fortunes because they will have been busted you're going to lose they'll lose all the way around there's no way they will ever win anything or have anything this is from the father himself he said number one they're trying to do this in a country that already is free they're not going to a third world country that isn't free they're trying to take things away from americans they're different they were born free they live free they make up their own mind they want a future he said there'll never be civil war that's what they were hoping for that we would be killing each other he said but americans true americans the red-blooded americans have a hope for a dream and a future they have a family they want a life and they want to live and they are not willing to give it up they didn't vote for evil they didn't choose evil he said an evil is not in power right now he will remind you of a scripture and the righteous are in power that people rejoice is that what it says well trump isn't power the other side is not they're illegitimate they stole the election he knows that almost 80 million people know that it was stolen because everybody knows who they voted for amen so this is an epic time in our country to show when truth prevails and the people prevail this country belongs to god and we the people amen the other thing they will never consider [Applause] and god says all the time i'm in your papers i'm on your money i'm written in your in your constitution you said i'm everywhere because i was allowed to be in this country he said when you look at the two differences between the illegitimate ones and the actual president i am welcome in this country by trump he even made that statement many times he recognizes who god is he invites god to be here he he loves christians he loves their faith he loves the the churches he loves and he wants us to have freedom and according to our constitution we have every right to have church to come together to meet is that correct so when the other side wants to wipe it out disallow it abolish it and crush it that should show you right there they're lost they have already lost what they want to plot and plan i'm not willing for that to happen amen and with all the prayers that have come forth on behalf of this country you need to know that when you pray they fill these bowls before the altar of god your prayers your worship fill these huge bowls and when they're full god tips them when they're tipped a whole new move of god comes to this earth so what is about to happen isn't crash and burn to be destroyed is about to be wiped clean of the evil and a powerful move of god is about to hit this country [Applause] and this is what the one who made everything is saying amen his words count above the others right amen but jesus christ wants is he not is not the earth his and the bones thereof the earth is who the lord and the fullness thereof then if it is his and he's already got this time planned who do you think is going to win jesus it doesn't matter how bad it looks or sounds and i would encourage everybody to stop watching the fake news because they plotted and planned to brainwash people all along they understand how that works and they have done that to many people i have family members i have friends that listen to it and all they know is this they hate trump they can't even tell you why they hate it they just know they hate him right and so they're brainwashed into thinking he's so bad they gotta vote for the other side they don't even know what the other side stands for i know i met somebody the other day before i came oh i like who's in there now i said you like evil you want terrorists to come into our country without any boundaries you want human trafficking and drugs to keep rushing into our country without anyone stopping them you want law and order taken away so people can come and burn your place or take whatever they want to from you and they're looking at me really strange well that's not what's going to happen i said they've already signed papers are you not listening to what they're saying oh no i just know they're good and trump is bad and that's what some people think they don't have a clue because they were taught for all those years continually when the same thing is put into you over and over again in your soul and you don't stop it or you don't lose it from there it builds in you as a man thinketh in his heart that's your soul so is he that means what you let in is what you will become your heart he talks about the bible all the time isn't this human beating heart it's the core the word heart means the core of something the center of something the core of your being is your soul you are a soul that's what god said when he made adam he became a living soul that is very key the other thing the body of christ needs to learn is what does that mean why is my soul so important why do you think he says to guard it you decide what goes in there you decide what you watch what you hear and what you say and all three of those things will affect who you are that's what will come out of you what you allow in there if you don't like you maybe you should change what you're saying or what you're watching because it will influence your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choose and your emotions how you respond to all that what do you act out in your life what do you actually say about you are you manifesting from christ his character his purposes his words clearly written because that's what he wants from us the world should look at us and see christ when they hear us they should hear christ is that right does christian mean christ's life then we need to start acting like that because when you do you terrify the devil if he can't crush you and put fear in you which has always been his greatest weapon his second greatest weapon is deception he's been working overtime with deception deceiving people taking up parts of the word making whole bibles that left hope books of the bible out or twist what they say i tell people make sure if you read the word of god it's got the whole counsel of god there's some that take out the the millennial reign of christ they even take out the tribulation some of them even say it's okay to sin and there's some people never heard any of this before but it's true because the enemy is doing whatever he can to deceive us amen and obviously some people have been deceived by believing a lie so i don't work for hell i don't represent hell i have nothing to do with hell there's no darkness in me i do not tolerate any acts or words or thoughts of the enemy yes yes i serve the most high god and him alone will i serve it's okay with me if people don't like my pink hair they will be taken to the welcome center when they get to heaven because you see people with every color of hair in heaven that's where the rainbow lives and the one who carried you you lived in that rainbow before you came here you had a little spirit of life that was your little spirit person lived in the father that's why we are his offspring you wrote on the rays of the rainbow in and out of him you played in the river of life inside of him you jumped on the stones of fire that burn with passion for you and online and that river of life goes over those those gemstones massive gemstone filled with a fire it shoots that rainbow out of him you lived there so he made a plan with the words on how to bring redemption how to bring mankind back to him in heaven some of the angels still call jesus christ the word you all know what the bible says the word was with god and was god and there was nothing that was made that was not made by him he had flesh put on him he agreed to come and die and that put on that cross and carry to that cross every sin wicked evil act word intentions he drank it in the cup in the garden even when he didn't want to did he give up his will did he say to the father not my will but your will be done and he drank all that evil he died in the garden when he surrendered himself because it wasn't just his body that had to hang on that cross every evil act and sin had to be put on that cross and someone who was perfect and holy had to carry that to the cross he was guiltless he was innocent no sin in his life even when he walked on this earth and yet he was willing to take that in him that is why he is the only one who can forgive your sins because he took those sins to the cross there's no other being that can do that for you there's no other religion out there that can say that you can get into heaven he is your way back to the father and part of his reward was when you die and moved to heaven you're not lost you didn't lose somebody they moved jesus christ is to walk you up the steps of the throne and say hear father i have brought your son or your daughter back to you that is why heaven rejoices and throws the biggest party ever every time someone comes home because jesus is going to get to do that that's part of his reward he loves to call you to get undone and when you step out of whatever you came in whether it's one of heaven's elevators whether it's a starship or it's christ's chariot there's many ways he can take you up to heaven when you get out you'll step into the river of life right there coming out of the city and he will start throwing water on you and you will have a water fight that's what you will have and you're going to see people dancing and singing all over even outside the gates they'll be celebrating there's music everywhere the flowers sing the trees seeing the ground is alive the sky is alive and you're stepping into life and some people like i thought we couldn't play music i thought it was going to be silent in heaven that was only one dime it was only one time it was silent in heaven that was it not since then you look for someone to be quiet you'll find a place and then the trees will start talking to you or the rocks or the creatures there's life everywhere so they have actually got a welcome center i'm not making it up you're going to laugh even harder when you see the humor of god this whole family i knew growing up in our city that owned all the funeral homes were strong believers they had compassion and kindness for people and one of the heads of all that was about ready to go home to heaven and god had me take this paper scroll paper and write in gold ink his word for that man that was ready for me to get a word for a person i usually prophesied corporately and i took it to the funeral home he was even in his 90s he was still there greeting people's families he had known for a long time and he's about to go inside and i said richard could i give you something and he said well what do you have i said i have a word from god for you and he started to cry on the sidewalk he said all my years of living and caring and loving no one has ever given me a word from god [Music] i said well he's gonna tell you your future in heaven gonna tell you what you're gonna be doing and god wrote all these beautiful words about him about he had been given a heart to care and great compassion and understanding to help people go through a time in their life and god said you always got them when they were going to heaven but now you will get them when they're coming to heaven because i'm putting you and all your family in charge of the welcome center and this is the hillary said you may tell everybody that you now your family now gets them going and coming and he was so undone and i said god would not let me just speak that word to you he has this scroll prepared as if he had handwritten himself it was this beautiful paper parchment paper i said this is your word and when you go home in a couple of weeks she said you'll be going in a couple of weeks you can let your brother know who's remaining what his future will be i said when he said that to me right yeah he took me up to heaven i saw your brothers they all look alike i saw your brothers i saw your father in this beautiful building and i saw people when they would get out of these transports and they're like this [Laughter] and they would walk in and say come on we're going to make it all okay yes you're in heaven i know it's more than you ever dreamed just come with us and we're going to explain and they had such compassion and kindness for the people and i love to tell that story because it shows you the humor of god but the reward of god he doesn't forget the kind acts that you do so i actually can say and you can say you know who's running the welcome center it is the heritage family from the hardest people and and i went to visit him once when he was in the hospice and i took him a picture of the portal in heaven i've been taken to where people look down and see their families and they can declare over them they go every year to sing happy birthday to you from from heaven and it's a beautiful place i was taken to they have them all over heaven and i i put that right beside where he was lying so he could look at it and he said i will never forget your act of kindness that you gave me god's word when i needed it the most and he said i am so looking forward to running the welcome center [Applause] and about a week after i went by there i was driving down the road and i knew where that where he was and that beat this beautiful hospice place and i actually saw him leaving with angels being taken up to heaven and god said look to the right and he said richard's leaving because i was obedient he allowed me to see him leaping and so i was very blessed so i started calling people richard richard heart just went to heaven before anyone else knew he went to heaven i just saw him he's leaving forever people are used to that for me and then they said then they had a head on the news because he was well known all the city uh we we we mourn the passing of richard harter to this day such that and i want thank you god for letting me see that so they celebrate from the time they step out of that old body this body is part of you it's what sleeps but you your spirit man never sleeps even when you're sleeping now your soul never sleeps that's a spiritual part of you your soul is awake you play music christian music at night you're feeding your soul if you play the word of god at night somewhere that's feeding your soul even things that like learning or mentoring tapes you're feeding your spirit man that's going in your soul what you hear goes in your soul and it can begin to change you some people i can't sleep in music i have it going 24 hours a day in my place in more than one room i want to saturate my walls i can walk in my home even if it's not on and i hear the music that plays all the time that remains in the room your words remain in your rooms where you live sometimes i walk in someone's home and hear things i don't like i'll step outside and i'll pray over them and break the enemy off at their home images remain in your home by stuff you watch we need a great understanding of our soul your soul doesn't sleep okay you feed it 24 hours a day your body gets fed three times a day sometimes five times a day in america probably five times or more and now you're all eating cake so you can add that to your wrist so your body gets fed several times a day right your spirit man god said sometimes once a week i feed mine every day i make sure my spirit man gets back the word of god whether i listen to it whether i read it or i listen to powerful speakers online now we got the internet god designed the internet by the way not the devil it does not belong to the devil amen and these words of god coming literally some people will have angelic beans come out of their computers this is a portal this is a portal it is a portal your computer is a portal your ipad is a portal whatever can carry images or transmit stuff it can transmit heaven or the other place you need to be careful what you put on here amen i'll be somewhere and i'll see things up like i'll see things come right out of the tv i'm very careful i need to tissue somebody i'm very careful about what my eyes see okay i don't want to put stuff in my soul it doesn't belong there i'm going to keep it sorry i'm going to keep my soul pure i want it pure and it's not that hard it's a lifestyle being like christ should be a lifestyle it's not a sunday thing although i'm thankful people actually go on sunday of course some people can't even go on sunday now but i want you know california is breaking all the rules right now california has had it with the lockdowns that's right and i noticed he's been speaking about america and that's what i'm leading up to you have to remember what the father said okay the enemy is not in power right now in this country it is not god still is trump still is he is a president he is the one who's in power he is in office so when the righteous are in office or they're in power the people rejoice that's why he's telling everybody to eat cake amen the worst thing you can do to the enemy right now is to you celebrate like it's already happened you know what this scripture says call those things that be not as though they were that means you act like they've already happened so if you believe victory is coming and it is then you should act like it he sets a table a table is what you eat from it's what you celebrate from that's what he's saying he's saying that scripture even the myth of every one thing around you he can set a temple of celebration for your life and it missed everything around you and that will begin to combat darkness because the enemy sees he's not winning hallelujah our life gets brighter that he put in us when he got born again you got part of the light of god put in you some people's light would blind the enemy some of you can already see it when you begin to stand for what is right and you don't step back that life society begins to blind the enemy and he gets terrified and i ask the father what else can they do they prayed they fasted they laid on their face they've encouraged people and he said they can eat cake and celebrate [Applause] and every time he's called me up to heaven guess what they're doing they're eating cake because they've already seen the victory happen amen the father's been from the beginning to the end in the end of the beginning and then he'll let you know you were there too before he made this earth and he sent you from himself he had already been from the end of the beginning the beginning of the end he'd already been there you were in him when he went there and made things you were in him living in him you've already been yourself from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning because you're you're eternal beings we are eternal amen you're born again one day you'll be immortal immortal means you can't sin you can't get sick you can't die that's your future some of those behind that barbed wire will not have that future amen so these are great days that we're living in but the father chose to explain things to you so it's perfectly clear to you like it is to him our country has a great future because it will impact this world we will be we'll we will be changers atmosphere changers amen we walk into place because of christ in us the atmosphere will change smith wigglesworth used to walk into places and people would fall on their face begin to cry out to god that was a measure the measure he's given us now is beyond that original measure you drive past people's homes and they'll in your homes fall out under the glory people will see your roofs on fire because the fire of god in you in your home people will walk in and out of the walls to go speak someplace one day i won't come by plane i'll walk through the wall and come right out on the platform these are greater days of glory that we're entering into and he has to expose the evil and it has to be dealt with it can't be taken off the earth at this time but it will be crushed back and we will rule with great authority and dominion we were given it by christ jesus he never let anything stop him in this earth not even time he was over time he would step in the spirit realm and walk through the people he didn't walk around the people i've been to the amount of the precipice i've been there i was in israel last year on the tour that they bushwhacked me with because no one told me i'd have to be on the bus at 8 am [Laughter] when i laid down at 7 am and no one told me as the speaker of this tour to 18 places in israel i climbed the mountains i went down inside of mountains i've been to every significant place in israel the dimensions in the bible and i thought i was going to have a nice place to speak in the hotel and i do a couple meetings a day and i have to go here my husband was laughing the whole time and i tell them steve showed someone you bushwhacked me they hooked a microphone on me and recorded everything he said wherever god says the prophets i do it well he had something to say everywhere i went where the fire came down before elijah i got to speak on the sea of galilee they had a fox so thick the boat couldn't leave so i commanded the fog to lift and it was gone in three minutes i don't tolerate the weather being over me it wasn't over christ was it right he was not afraid of anything in the enemy the enemy would run from him the demons would scream when he would be around them and he walked as a righteous man on this earth he chose he had to choose with his will he had to live just like us he was still the son of god but he's also called the son of man he's appointed with every single thing that we're tempted with or attacked with and yet he was victorious in every way in his life why because he was setting an example for us you can live that way i live that way it's different but it's fun it's fun to walk holy because you choose to be holy people say you can't be holy i said the bible says we can it says he's coming for a church this is one of the reasons why he's not coming right now should be pretty evident the world will know us by our love for each other i challenge you to go talk to some worldly people and ask them if you think the church loves one another it says in the bible they will know us by our love for each other so guess what he's not coming right now roll up your rapture rug and stick in the closet it clearly says the wealth of the wicked and they sure have a lot that's been pretty evident for everybody the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just and the righteous that has not been transferred yet are you willing to leave without that it says even by christ himself the works i did you will do how many people do you know are walking on water raising the dead that stinks they're in the grave so long making food appear everywhere wherever they need it to appear stepping in a boat and transporting it in time itself stepping in the spirit room and walking through places we need to already be doing that because those greater works are coming rapidly when you will raise the dead of the funeral that was cremated where you will stop an earthquake that started until it to put it back the way it was before it came where you tell the weather what it can and cannot do we have to be ready for those things because he's not holding them back once he does this what he is going to do is setting the platform for us he's not doing it just to bless the world it is for the body of christ to step up and be who we were called to be you were born here because he wants you here you're an american you're here to represent god himself that's why he made america he calls it his gift his first gift was his son his second gift to the world was america where people walk in righteousness and they have liberty and freedom and justice in their country where they honor and respect him and they're not ashamed of who he is the moral majority in this country did vote on november 3rd and they chose justice liberty and freedom we didn't choose the other stuff that the devil tried slipping in their lives are not going to be good because they chose what was wrong and they feed upon people and they destroy people they want to crush our country they want to make it into a third world country they don't care about anybody's color of their skin they care about nothing but evil and wickedness hurting and harming they will use anything they can to make their point and they will lie every time they do it so god is not tolerating what they have said will happen it will not happen and it will not remain and it will not be forever it will not be very long down the road before what he showed me will happen he showed me when that freedom is announced he showed me when they will be forced to announce the election was [Applause] [Music] stolen for these four years he needs to continue what he has started god gave him to start in this country i think he's going to be a little bit more tempered having had to see all the evil but i promise you he despises evil and when god first showed me trump he said he is an all-american boy who is all for america that's how god himself described him and he has lived that before all of us even with a hate never and our history our country has a president been so wrongly accused and hated and just people feed on that i mean they feed evil feeds on that and then when others came in to join them and decided to collude with them that means it became a part of what they were planning to block everything we said that was truth they wouldn't allow they don't want people to know the truth they think if they can keep the truth from being heard that what they want will happen but they're wrong about that too some networks will be lost they won't exist anymore because of the lies they conspired to overthrow this country anyone who committed conspiracy to overthrow the presidency or the overseer of the country are going to prison amen please don't hear about already overseas they're making arrests for those who from other countries leaders of other countries people in high places in other countries have already been arrested and i think they're going to get as many from there as they can and then they're going to it's going to happen here you will see you will see justice justice will be served amen [Applause] to miss your destiny nor your future amen it's just going to get greater and greater in the days to come these are not the days of great darkness there will not be cities burning other than the ones they burned their south and all those cities that have been burned people were paid to do that they were all hired even the people for black lives matter antifa they have paid for all of that to be done not to help anyone they're using them they even make promises to china for things and now people are wanting to collect on the promises so now some of them behind the barbed wire are hiding because they can't deliver what they thought what they would already have in their hand by now they thought we'll have civil war half the people will be dead we'll just go in and collect everything and take over [Music] we're not gonna have civil war we don't want civil war we have freedom we have our lives we love our families so they're never going to get us to do that amen and this is from the father they will never get your guns there's far too many red lakes in america he even shocks me sometimes with some of the things that he says but i have to agree because i know some of those run nets he said they'll never reach them they'll be dead before they can get to them one of the reasons why they haven't done anything is we can still get them because we have our arms it's written in our papers we have the right to bear arms is that correct we have many freedoms and liberties given to us in our constitution they're trying to twist everything they can it's still not gonna work and until god i'm glad you're gonna do something quicker than later because the rednecks i'm gonna wait much longer my brother has a hotline to him you haven't heard about my brother you go back and look at some of those videos you hear about him he is all for justice he has to make out himself he has a hotline from homeland security and some other groups that are organized should they need their help their guns are ready and trump said there's a reason why i said go home and go home and stay safe you know i will be back he's trying to keep us you know not not get upset or not have fear come in us and the other thing god promised was he will take the virus off the face of the earth [Applause] [Music] devious purposes to bring heart to you the social distancing was to keep us apart so we wouldn't come together although the bible is very clear don't forsake the gathering together of yourselves and so he's against social distancing in case you wonder he doesn't like it there's no social distancing in heaven and there's no mask in heaven there's not even handshakes choose only hugs and i keep telling people we're gonna have a mass burning party one day i am not ignorant to the fact that there are some people who have compromised lives already you know they have issues if they want to wear them let them wear them i'm not against them wearing them i'm against me being forced to wear one when i don't need what i [Music] and i don't like it every time they say the new normal they can have them in normal but it's not going to be in this country safer to apart no we're not safer apart right that's never been true we're safer together amen we're here together we're in this together and we have a god who has a plan he says he hasn't gone on dates everyone else pip so they've jumped off the wagon they're wagging a victory in celebration they just think we're just going to give it and i'm not rolling over to anybody no i'm not giving that up i know god has a plan and hang in there you're going to be really happy that you were some of the ones who said all along victory is coming and everyone will have to eat their words but they'll still be happy that we're free amen so you remember jesus who we belong to and gave ourselves to hold your life in his hand no man holds your life in their hand he wants us all to be free even the bible said god never intended for a person to be over us he wasn't all for the kings at all he didn't appoint kings man wanted a king to be maybe you didn't know that back in the old days they demanded to have a king be over them and so from that point on there's always been leaders presidents kings those in authority over people that's why he said when the righteous are in power the people rejoice because they have a good one when the wicked is they're not going to rejoice amen we are rejoicing amen hallelujah so i won't talk but a few minutes more because you know i'm you know when i'm finally awake which i'm kind of awake you don't know but i'm actually sleeping it's hard to get up in the morning for me that's my that's my night time and i tell people it's not the next day until i go to sleep and i wake up then it's the next day my family has mostly adapted to the way uh my hours are i like that since i was little my husband used to go to sleep at ten o'clock no matter what was going on he can hang in there until midnight at least sometimes one in the morning my mom will hang in there to two or three in the morning with me she's gonna be 90 next year and she said if she had her way she'd be taking a plum switch up to that barbed wire and be making some changes herself [Laughter] she's still my mom and i'm blessed that she lives with me but she definitely has her own opinions about things and she's not happy with it either but she also understands and she does pray for people people who are seniors in certain situations in their life she prays all the time for them she actually has an anointing for people for married couples that can't have children she's highly anointed if she prays for you i have a baby in nine months it has happened over and over and over usually when she comes to me she has her own prayer line so she's brought many babies from heaven to earth by praying for people releasing her anointing to to bring them from heaven to earth for god she still does that she still prays for people and it works her faith is there she operates i operate you know in the revelation zone she operates in the baby zone so i i love what i do i love people i can honestly say i love you i love you with the father's love and he does have great plans for us and i wish everyone could hear these words he cares he doesn't like sickness and disease he doesn't like anger he doesn't like violence he doesn't like life being taken from us that's nothing he purposed for us and so if people don't know jesus christ i will encourage anybody watching right now that you make sure you receive jesus christ as your savior it gives you more than just hell insurance okay it gives you authority dominion it helps you to step into the supernatural and in these days of greater glory we'll see things never seen before on the earth with the signs and wonders that will be done people will be shocked and stunned to see really the power of god in us because of his son so i look forward to seeing you all again and i i pray that you have a blessed day oh i'm absolutely going to be speaking at the inaugural prayer breakfast okay i got to pray for him back in 2000 when they had the last prayer breakfast i actually got to pray for him for the vice president for their families for the future of america and i'm telling you god and don't and you reserve your judgment for pence okay don't judge people when you don't know everything you don't understand covert activities you don't know what's going on so reserve your judgment for him okay they're very close they really care for each other i know people in their administration so don't jump on something because you see something or hear something you can't tell everything that's going on especially if it's covert it won't be covered amen so we will see what is decided about that what decisions are made i do know that god did pick pence for eight years also like he did the president and i need to let you know that means if trump won the election that means vice president pence also won that election amen so we'll see what god's going to do i do want you to get ready to celebrate in your life like you never have before eat cake in moderation and right now i had already asked them if i could teach you a dance [Applause] if i if i could teach this dance to you i'm kind of fine if i actually have now i do have music can you all play everybody dance now can you dance now i'm teaching them you might have to play that one from your phone dancing [Applause] [Music] everybody i'm trying to stop it first because i have to teach it to you first because we can play it up here through this pa system my husband's brother now we're going to okay this first if you go why do you do this because it's heaven culture okay uh church is supposed to be fun amen it is god in heaven but when i started speaking not only did i have to show up with my pink hair which freaked out a lot of pastors i don't know why i thought you know and i even knew like 40 some pastors in mine was sitting they said you've gone too far you fell off the edge so now we can't work with you it's just while some people will look and go know that you don't qualify anymore well you know the holy spirit already warned me and he i actually saw angels doing this dance that we're going to learn in my own church we had a prophet several prophets coming at a panel they did a q a session and all their angels were standing behind them on the platform because i see the angels see all of yours by the way they're excited because they you're going to do this famous they're going to be doing this dance with you okay and so i saw them doing this dance and i'm like well that's wow that looks like fun what was that the holy spirit said they're doing the revelation dance because the people have received revelation this day and they're excited and then i went to canada about two weeks later and i was speaking with people there we had four hour meetings they would break for lunch and we'd come back i said boy they did it and and in the second meeting the hospital said you're going to teach them all that dance what dance the humor in all this is all three of my daughters their gift is dance they do ballet do all the traditional beautiful stuff they're anointed people been raised from the dead when they dance they've been healed when they dance it is who they are and i don't dance at all i've been kicked out of jazzercise classes okay and now he's telling me all my daughters laugh hysterically every time i talk about it you have to teach them you're teaching everyone in there this dance because we want them to celebrate they're going to learn to celebrate when they receive revelation they need to celebrate and so i did and i think the only song i at that time knew about was when the saints come marching in so i talked to him and so when i get back to where i live um i heard this music and the holy spirit said that's the music we want you to learn to teach it to them and that's that's that's a secular song he said yes but we like that song we want everyone to tell us they're going to dance when they get to heaven they may as well practice now and so ever since then i have taught this dance to that song and does anybody here know that dance anyone i know you do you really come up here if anyone has done the students before you can come up here a couple of you come up here everything on camera is going to be doing this dance too they will jump in and do it a lot of them already know it it's actually caught the revelation names but for some reason because i talked to my angels everybody calls it if you google angel dance it will bring up congregations all over the world doing this dance and so it's it has three movements that's all i'll tell you what they each mean and then i'll show you with you the first one is that um i'm receiving revelation it's treasure so i'm digging up treasure that's that's the first movement the second one is i'm celebrating the revelation the third one is i'm gonna share it everywhere [Applause] and i didn't know anything about counts or beats or nothing okay i can't even play a tina marine i was going off the stage that is not my gift i can't even keep me to that and so someone uh the holy spirit said you gotta do to account eight and i'm like i was coming and then this angel appears again when i wake up in the morning which is noon this angel appears to me in my room and he goes watch i don't know if he was happy with the assignment or not he said watch this and he did the whole thing and he was speaking he said wow we're digging up revelation that's like treasure you know he did it to the count of eight he said now we're celebrating the revelation and now we're gonna share it everywhere and he said he looked at me goes did you get that i said i got it he goes good you go oh my gosh so that's what we're going to do so we're going to practice so we're going to practice up here first okay are you ready uh you can play with me okay so we're going to practice it first you can watch his practices and you're all going to get a practice [Music] ready [Music] okay cut now it's your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] your turn are all getting ready to do this dance with you it's crazy so we're going to start when i say start we'll all start together the thing is when you turn around don't do like rapid okay because somebody's going to be halfway in this when you're already going all the way so you're kind of tired together so are you ready yeah okay here we go we're gonna practice go ahead and start the music [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's go [Music] [Applause] okay we're going to go three times all the way around and then we can all just go okay okay are you ready to start the music your kids can come up if you want to wait wait wait wait wait everybody [Applause] [Music] okay here we go again [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh i can tell you uh probably my hardest group to teach was a group of 80 baptist ministers [Applause] god doesn't cut any i was invited in canada they had a monthly prayer meeting unit for like 15 years right they'd have a guest speaker well they didn't tell anybody i was going to be there so when we got there margaret and i sat at this table we could see eyes piercing us right who's this woman with pink hair i'm like margaret i think they got tired feather feathering in their mind and this little guy gets up and they all knew him because there was a few catholics there there were a few presbyterians a few but mostly retired practice winners not even like new young ones and by the time i got up and i introduced myself and and the guy played his little accordion for worship that wasn't enough to burn my flesh all their angels were behind them laughing so hard they could hardly stand up and so i said i was here to share heaven they got to call me up in heaven and they were like this there was not one bit of emotion on their faces they were so angry at the the guy who was the head of the breakfast and i said i'm just going to press him and i started talking about what it was like to stand before the son of god and of course in their mind i could read it no one can stand see the face of god then die they would die i mean that's what was in their minds and then about five minutes in they started to cry i saw tears coming down their eyes and then across their arms and they sat there they were so undone by the love of god and explaining what it was like to see before him and the ways of consuming passion that came from him and how you well he welcomed you home to heaven as his son and daughter no one cared in that room that i was a woman nobody cared i had pink hair they began to shake visibly shake sitting in their seats because of the presence of the holy spirit they didn't even know they didn't know how to respond they didn't know what to do all they could do was shake and then when we got vienna said now i'm going to teach you something they do in heaven by that time they didn't care what i said i said so heaven does this dance angels do the same uh revelation about heaven and about the father and about his son they do this dance would you all like to learn this dance and they yelled at the top of their lungs yes and we had our little computer with us and we were going to plug it in to get the music that music and i said when we do it to this music you may not understand but we have to do everybody dance now because you know they don't dance in church they don't raise hands in church and i'll tell you before we were done they were dancing raising their hands and we couldn't get our music converted so the little guy said well i can play you know uh when the saints come marching in on my little thing got up and learned that dance and they were laughing and they were crying in her hands okay in the beginning when he did his little recording thing he was saying it's okay to raise your hand god won't strike you down and none of them raised their hand they were all like they were doing the whole thing the best part was they were going to have a second meeting and they called all their friends you have to come this person didn't say lady this person has been the handwritten talked about the throne of god there was twice as many pastors in that room it was like there were 200 glasses in that room and the animals couldn't wait until i said now we're going to learn a dance it was life changing life changing for all of them so if they can do it you can do it amen and we did that all over america wherever i traveled in the world everybody learned that dance and we know some pastors that had it taken on purpose and they welcome people to the church then they play the dance on the screen and everybody gets up they either want to stay or they want to leave but heaven is like that they celebrate all the time you know and people love their life there they can't wait for you to get there they make plans for you they get these little things to actually record places that they go that they can keep that they know you will love specifically to go and see in heaven so you're going to be really busy when you get there amen so the other thing i want to do is lay hands on every person here amen and i'm going to give out importations to everybody amen if you want it i promise you that i'm healthy and whole but you know it says that that you get implications by the laying on of hands is that right so i'm not going to mock laying my hand on you i'm actually going to put my hand on you right here i'm going to release the love of god so the way i usually do this is we get a line going and you walk i'll like i'll stand here and that line will form all the way around and you come up to me and i'm just going to say come here honey are you just come up here and i'll go i i impart the love of god into you and it will go from here because i operate in it it'll go here into your heart okay and you'll begin to feel his presence in you so and remember whatever it is you need from him because this is from him you can ask for if you need healing if you need finances if you need you know things in your mind restored whatever it is you can ask me for it at that moment okay so oh and make sure you say i receive it okay everybody practice i receive it and that's you saying yes that you do accept that so remember you have not because you asked not so by coming being willing to come up here you're saying you're going to have it amen so we need to get that line somebody needs to get that line going maybe i think we usually start where we start from the back or the front i don't remember yeah so i think the last the last row come around here and just get in line right here and as you receive it just go back and sit down this doesn't take very long because i'm not going to go to every person and take hours to do that okay this is an accelerate accelerated way to receive we're entering into accelerated days so it won't take very long to do that all right that's what i was thinking

[Applause] if you see me making hand motions i'm copying the angels in the room they never are stagnant they're always moving they're always moving and so they really loved anything that worships the lord every time they go wild leaving in the throne room when when you're worshiping or adoring jesus christ just for a while but a lot of them they were going like this well most of them were going like this except the ones behind her one behind her was going so i have to call you when i'm watching it's hard not to do it the throne room is a powerful powerful place it is so amazing to have been there and the seraphim when the seraphim starts singing they come out of the glory cloud over the throne and their hair is on fire it's like blue fire and they sing and they sing and they sing and they sing i keep inviting them to come so if they ever showed them though your hair probably turned blue and catch on fire there's some of the fire carriers in the throne room but to be there on purpose there's nothing like no one is up there crying that they died as hard as that might seem to you to imagine they're not no one's crying no one is sad no one is grieving no one remembers anything bad that rhyme that wasn't me his holy spirit they they don't they're so in the glory really and that thing about for all of sin that comes short of the glory of god it's not about you committing sins i hear that you know if they don't have revelation they don't understand what that means that means you you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying it for him releasing it for him it comes out of you like shockwaves begin to permeate everything it touches every person every place we we we don't do that we don't know how to do that it's something we'll do now in this time you are in one of the most important times on the face of the earth one of the most blessed times regardless of what your i see your ears here no you were chosen from the beginning of time to be here you were meant to be here all of your family members are so excited you're here amen you're not looking at the mass you're not looking at the virus which is you know pretty much gonna be taken off the face of the earth by god it's being used against everybody it really is i'm not saying it's not there i'm not saying it hasn't touched some people but it's nothing like what they're saying it is you need to know the truth i bring the truth i have to speak the truth okay all of this that you're living in now will be like dust in a very short time acceleration in this world and not just america this whole thing is yes it's here we know it's here uh we we talk about it we share what do we do but let me tell you it's worldwide what god is going to do he he is planning and his plan will take place it will say it will say god's will god's way not man's way not the enemy's way it will be god's way this country will be known by the glory of god the presence of god and he's setting it up you yes to understand there's covert operations in heaven and there's covert operations on earth and maybe you don't know all that but yes things are happening you cannot see but you will see them suddenly say suddenly it will all be known say everything will be known all the stuff about the elections will be known [Applause] and we will celebrate [Applause] and i know wonderful people talk about revivals a lot of people talk about moves of god a revival is kind of i don't want to say stagnant but it's kind of centralized in certain places what's coming isn't going to be centralized moves of god will come together to create one thing and that is called a habitation say habitation is what is coming it can't be controlled it can't be stopped and it can't be changed it's coming from heaven and we will be the habitation no one can move us or take us from the place god puts us so no matter how people are putting it what really is coming is a habitation of god yes that has never happened before on the face of the earth and you will not just get delivered you'll get to share it you get to experience it you get to carry it say carry it say the knowledge of the glory will happen because we will carry that glory all over this world so don't think of yourself of being left out okay that's not possible say if i'm alive and breathing i'm part of it that's how it's gonna be this time amen amen say for generations step out of your box and just say it for generations until god is done the boy will grow and build and cover the whole earth like the waters cover the sea the world will know there is a god and they better decide amen the other thing that i know is truth we can all say this together nothing that was done through cheating stealing lying unjust accusations will not escape being brought to justice [Applause] and let me tell you the god side knows a whole lot that's been going on that maybe you don't know and i am talking about trump that's okay if you're not okay come outside we'll get you saved and you know the person who likes him the least is the devil truly the one who's most terrified of him of trump is the devil say the devil doesn't like him maybe i should one of the few presidents who has said to the people i'm here to give your country back to you and i'm here to welcome jesus back into the white house he wasn't always perfect everyone knows that especially the fake news but they're stuck on it they all they do is hit replay and i've traveled all over the world when all that stuff started people were what's wrong with your news i want nothing not my news and not my news by the way you'd be better off not listening to anybody okay they know that they can brainwash you they know that they can compromise your soul to believe exactly what they're saying and that's why they keep saying it if you've never heard things about people that have gotten brainwashed that's how they do it they get you in a place so you will believe what they're saying then they'll say it over and over and over and guess what's going to come out of your soul say as a man thinketh in his heart that's his soul so is he that's what's happened to all of them their souls have been compromised they know it okay the darkness knows it all the others who are part of all that mess they all know that and that's why they keep it going that's why they don't want the truth to be known that's why they don't want us saying anything that's why they block you or be in you whatever they're doing they're so terrified that people will hear the truth and begin to believe it they don't want them i know i know i have i have really close friends who just did that they fed on it they're not the same people they're not the same people that's why every now and then anyway free soul checkup and i offer help to all those out there who have been compromised lose it from your soul and i'm really serious about that he made us that we can loose things remember the keys of the kingdom what you loose on earth will be loose from heaven what you bind on earth can be bound on him loose all the bad all the negative all the hurt trauma tragedies all of the fear all the fake news every word you've ever heard lose it all from your soul heaven will come down and pull it out and they really do that they will do that i've seen people change in three minutes from doing that then then you bind the things of god i choose my will to find the life of god the love of god the presence of god his will his way his word i find the truth to my soul and there is no one on the earth that can take it out of you that's what they need to heal the world actually needs a soul checkup right so it's not that hard to be free it's not number one you have to know that you're not you need to know when you've been deceived because the devil for eons and ages always use fear as his number one weapon now it's deception it really is because when you say yes to deception you're deceived and when you're deceived you can't see the truth understand the truth or even want to know the truth so this whole country and other people all over the world i always do those soul checkups if you hear me doing it that's why i'm doing it i want them to be free right that's right and after the first election i offered it free to all the democrats a post-election therapy i called it to have your soul set free and a lot of people did it and i have that a lot of people call me contact let me play says hey i did that i'm free we will get some new networks i promise you the truth is some of them will close and be shut down we'll keep on with the truth okay from the justice that's coming some of them will lose their network and you don't even know this but some ceos have already started stepping down the thing about deception is when you aren't deceived and you willingly knowingly do what's wrong and you know commit crime you're quite aware that it just might not work yeah so this whole thing that they're doing when they see isn't working they just put more barbed wire around them he's not god they can't stop god i'm not going to stop god so i also knew this that when these things the landslide starts can't stop it that's called justice amen a lot of them will try to run some may end their life we need to pray for those people because they don't want they don't want what that word was saying up there about the shame they didn't want people to know what they were doing but everyone's going to know what everybody was doing because it's already been collected amen and so they they have proof all the proof they need and i will just mention this for those who don't know this is a truth meeting how about that this is the truth the truth is that they've already been uh tried in a different kind of a court and been found um guilty and uh in case you didn't know uh trump is actually a president i just say that he did win he wants anyone they tried to steal it it's not going to work [Music] and the crazy thing in all this is they're trying they when i say they i mean the left delivers whatever you want to call them they god calls me villains i'll just say what he does the villains we're hoping we would just give up and do what they wanted they forgot one thing we we the people do not a third world country where we are in control say we are free and we're staying free man that made a big mistake and one thing he didn't consider that we wouldn't don't all dumb goblin has happened no they're not smart because we run closer to him we get closer to him we hear him clear we become more dangerous against hell that's what happens when you press on god's people that's exactly what happened so mistake number one was that you thought everybody would just dump god and give him up they don't know us say they don't know us they're about to find out amen [Music] so that was their first mistake the second mistake is we're already free we live free say we're free right now we aren't bound get anything to villains has written down his new laws and i have to say this to you because the father said this to him he said tell them this please it says when the righteous are in power the people rejoice so why don't you rejoice because the truth is the humans have no power they are not in power say the villains are not in power the righteous are in power so we're going to keep rejoicing while they remove the others the best show on earth jesus christ wiping out hell these are going to be glorious days and i am so excited to be here okay i got born again i i came out born again i think i do remember at age four receiving christ and because i'm a senior i saw him step inside of me you can't tell a child is four years old that he's not real and that doesn't really happen you're really more open to it than most people when they get older it's a little bit harder because your mind gets in the way i saw him step inside of me i liked it so much when i turned five for my birthday i did it all over again this is how precious jesus he stepped out to step back in [Music] for a birthday present so living life with heaven all the time is definitely different i tell people all the time i'm i'm like an eight-year-old if you pick on me you're picking on nate road they forget it really soon right they see a pretty flower a crawling bug or a piece of cake and they forget it so he really did i i worked with ceos most of the time i was i love business i'm a business person actually i'm a ceo hey this is how we dress when you get in here and having your ceo right they're the best apparel ever you don't get a nightgown in the bathrobe and having people i hope you didn't not for the one who owns everything he's not going to give you that that's not what people wear up there you have an apparel wardrobe room it's like a thousand square feet maybe more than that and every kind of beautiful amazing thing because there's so many things to do in heaven you can't ride a roller coaster in a gown in case you wonder i wouldn't try it for so long i grew up in the church trust me from the day i was born i was in church and i was there for every revival every special visitor it didn't matter if it lasted six weeks i was there every night for six weeks along with all my siblings and my parents would space the older ones in between the younger ones you know when you got 15 i mean several people i was i was an adult at age eight that's why he kept me video see i earned it because from that age i had to help take care of my 12 of my siblings everyone was a chief okay they were all in charge all highly anointed uh you know they they needed to be tempered a whole lot they practiced on me and from a very young age i could see in the spirit room i understood it being the father son holy spirit i remember when i invited the holy spirit he came inside me like a whirlwind and he's been there ever since and i can tell you how that happens who wants to know how he can be everywhere at the same time anybody want to know he has unlimited layers of himself one of the key words in heaven is layers there's layers of everything layers of space you can have like 10 places on your space your one mansion's on and it's hard to explain except when they teach me how to say it you can see it and so on your mansion let's say you have a city i've seen some people's mansions the size of new york city so maybe you better expand your thinking say expand that and on your management property there are these doors suspended just above the ground a beautiful door different colors different doors like around your or your whole property where your actual mansion is sitting on whether it's in the middle of the crystal sea under the crystal sea on top of the mountain spices in the valley of the falls uh wherever it is that he puts it uh on that property will be doors and if if you open the door you can see the other space that yours with places in there that are yours you can walk around the door like i could walk around this this is how there's no limit to space in heaven here's the door let's pretend this is the door you can walk around the door you see the door right you see it you can walk around it's just this but if you open the door you step into another whole area that belongs to you that could be in the valley of the falls the mansion out here is maybe on the beach of the crystal sea or the mountain spices so you get many he said what do you say i go to repair a place for you in my father's house a world not a flat place in the sky are many mansions i go there to prepare a place for you so he's not going to tell you any more than that oh until you get there and then you find out really how magnificent and amazing he is there's so many things adventure excitement intensity a joy humor all of that is in heaven that's why we have it here say it was there first it trickled down to here they have mountains they have valleys they have oceans you can ride a 200 foot wave and not die when you crash off of your board because you haven't done enough times up there the waves can change direction while you're on them okay they can open up they can swing you back and forth is heaven it says eyes have not seen your ear heard or entered in the heart or mind of man but he has prepared for you except and unless is revealed by the spirit of god i stand on that scripture for every time they've taken me every time they've shown me i can stand on that because of that i can see i can know and i can't understand and that's my commission my commission is to reveal heaven to this earth that's why i go all the time non-stop they have not stopped since 1996 taking me i used to try to count gave that up pretty soon and guess what when does he do it whenever he wants to why i gave him permission you have my permission to do with me whatever you want if you ever said that you better watch out because these are the days of the glorious signs and wonders that manifested signs with through the daughters and sons of god on the earth those aren't other beings who are going to come here and have it yes you say it's us we're your sons and daughters we'll manifest and demonstrate [Applause] hearing things and uh seeing things you never saw before and don't worry when he tells you you're going to hear him how does he do that uh step up and do that step out go up to the front of the funeral and raise the dead that was cremated [Music] [Applause] that happened a few times maybe facebook won't block it that's probably going to be replaced also by the way yeah they'll just be replaced and you know they didn't really do all that until guess who started running for office because he's a threat he said you can't be bought talk about trump again i don't mind insane it can't be bought can't be controlled they can't make him afraid and he already knows the truth so they can't convince him to lie they can't even deceive him he knew all of them before this started happening because the wealthy and the rich are invited to everybody's inner circle whether the good or not they know he knew the corruption that's why he was willing to do it we don't know what they're lying out of their teeth i know what they're doing i know all the stuff they're involved in no hey yes i will run and they were afraid from the day he said that they tried everything we could of 17 people trying to get that spot on the republican ticket and god told me i will eliminate them one by one by one and they will be forced to put him there guess what happened they were forced to put him there amen i know even even through history there's always been people that nobody else would have picked but god and some of them were very colorful yeah but if anybody ever heard all the stuff that was said against him they would think he wasn't worth anything and yet right now he's very valuable to god if anybody likes it or not he will be leading all this stuff that's going to be happening and while we've been out here some people not maybe y'all people are afraid not knowing what their life is going to be like how's everything what about all these horrible things being made from the villains laugh that's what heaven is doing about it there probably was never anything on the papers just so you know that they didn't waste the time to do it they whatever they can get away with the food people they're doing this is to say this is truth we just can't be deceived amen and most of people i've talked to i start to start a conversation anywhere in the airport the grocery store i don't care where it is so what did you think about the elections see i used to say hey i voted for trump 90 of everyone i talked to by the way you voted for trump yeah they did and the ones that didn't don't even know what the other ones are doing up there right now i confronted one of those the other day in my own yard yeah my husband hired him to mow front yard and came to the back he should have never done that i was about there i was back there because we released a home from friends of ours who were pastors in new york so uh the guy was replacing the little fertilizer fertilizer see i can't even think that what are they called where's my husband where are they putting the ground those tubes to kill the bugs that come in to eat your house up terminator see my natural brain don't ask me a question heaven spirit round future past you know anything about god father son holy spirit the 12 you know what are they the 12 the 24 elders know i know all of them already oh the seven spirits of god aren't just his attributes those are seven spiritual beings in case you wonder oh yeah they are actually seven smooth the wednesdays so they're seven spiritual beings it's one of the images they use god sends them on special assignments i laugh when you hear cloak and dagger that's usually about you know murder mysteries but actually holy spirit wears a club all the time he loves to he wears one the seven spirits of god wear them that came from heaven that's not a hell thing hell stole too many things okay say house deals because they can't create something new and so anyway so i was back there with a guy replacing those termite tubes and i said the same thing hey so uh he's up say he's a millennial too i said so what did you think about the elections i think they were stolen yes they were still on the lousy themselves they're all villains i want you to say what god calls them and then comes around the corner the other guy so what do you think about the elections oh i think i am so glad they got someone in there the other one was such a rotten lousy guy oh you're talking about fighting right might as well say his name yeah now i'm talking about something so oh no no no no he is the good guy do you know what the other ones are doing do you even know what they're doing well i know they're doing good things for this country but you cannot watch one single thing that they said they're doing and you don't know that they want to let all the terrorists in the world here with no pulse bar did you know they want to break down the law so all those human trafficking people can come through and just gather more to take out and and you obviously don't know that they're going to wipe out church completely because they don't want god here and this guy guy had already said to me god bless you well that's who you believe then you don't need to know those people up there because god's not blessing now he's going to remove them oh i don't think that let's just end this really quick conversation i would tell you they have all the evidence if they had no no i'm not talking about civil civil evidence i'm talking about military tribunal evidence i'm talking videos i'm talking testimonies i'm talking things that have been taped that you would be so horrified to find out what they actually have been doing even before they started their what they knew who they connected to what they've been doing all around this world it's already there it's there and they have it these guys who are in there now faking who they think they are they will be wiped out and god will say exactly who our president is back there maybe not in that spot but he's going to play back he will still run this country he is president he doesn't have to be proven to be president he already has won he won the other guy over here going yes yay the termite guy and this guy was probably in his late 40s and this young guy knew more than he did he was he was very aware of what was going on you'd be surprised if you talked to how many people voted for the other guy don't know anything that they're doing because all they know is they hate the other one and that was their plan we will bring this i'm serious it's what they do in other countries they brainwash people to believe what they want to then they go do whatever they feel like that's how those people live that's how people live in venezuela and other countries they know what socialism and communism is and they don't want it this way they try to escape so they made a few announcements and the whole rest of their campaign on the left was how horrible he is and if you ask him why is he horrible well i don't know but he's just i can free you from that right now in your soul do you wanna then they run come over here i'll get rid of that of your soul you need to get that out of your shoulder you can live a normal life again and actually tomorrow's when i talk about america this is this commercial for tomorrow amen because heaven is celebrating everywhere right now they're celebrating because they do know what time it is on god's timeline and if people don't know this is i'm talking about pastors and i won't talk about pastors revenge as well okay evangelists kind of got it made because they're still going for the big harvest right now we're going to talk about the naked harvest we're going on with the big harvest that's what we're here for what no you should be a voice for truth no matter what else you do you should say the truth let people know where you stand with what god wants what god asks of us let life live let life live and don't take it amen and anyone who wants to take life you're already in a really hard spot but god if you voted for life to be taken from babies you are in trouble and i can honestly say that according to the word of god you're in trouble you are and one day you'll be falling on your face repenting when you find out the truth of what the other ones were doing continually amen so i gotta let go let's let go and set it back here somewhere up here because god is right now beginning to create that habitation and people need to know number one the world's not ending now i'm talking about heaven it's not over say it's not over i just the father says it's over not even jesus knows when it's over and i have new spheres not coming for a church that is fighting each other angry at each other despising each other spitting on each other shall i continue coming for a church and a bride who has no sin and no flesh showing up in flesh and fleshy fighting it is what the spiritual mind is life refreshing mind it is he said i offer you life and death what do you say to choose my life a lot of people miss that this time around because life is what you're going to get everybody's going to get life even the ones who didn't want it it's going to come it's not going to stop from coming and he knows his timing he has a timeline around his behind his own throne his throne is in the middle of the throne room it's not on the back wall and you'd always seen these paintings there's god on his throne and there's millions of people all over here who can't get to him he didn't ever do that it's in the middle when four sets of steps and people run up there all the time all the time if you make it to heaven you're going to get to see god okay you get to see father you get to see jesus i never understood these people that said there's levels you have to get you after you get up there no the bible doesn't say does that no no it says the pure in heart shall see god amen and that means it can be now once you get born again or when you go to heaven people need to get over that no one can see the face of god and live oh trust me everything within you that was wrong would die instantly if you saw him but the bible clearly says the pure heart shall see god right so guess what i see him i see him i see jesus christ i didn't see the invisible spirit of god i see the outline of his person usually fires going around him or whirlwinds of the rainbow or going around him but i see him he's big and he is called the drama king in heaven well he sure creates drama every time he touches the earth doesn't he they were not suspecting him back in the day when he fell and began to do things that people were spinning and jumping over furniture and they really were doing crazy wild things way back they didn't even know what they didn't really know what they had they just knew it felt good we should be well acquainted with it he is my best friend and he speaks to me all the time guess what he's always speaking always say always are you hearing him you're hearing but maybe we need to unclutter our soul the more stuff you get in the layers you are a later being holy spirit as unlimited layers thank you holy spirit for reminding me i was supposed to talk about that see i told you you don't smell the time holy spirit is very powerful being he's still with celebration and joy drama excitement that's him if there's enough roar in heaven holy spirit there then i get corrected doctrinally i thought he moved to the earth why don't you have a conversation with him i'll let you talk to him about that and see what he says to you okay he has unlimited layers of himself so when he involves you you don't get a little piece you get a hold of him he takes a layer of himself and throws it in you that's how that happens unlimited layers that's how he can be everywhere all the same time all over the world know everything see everything hear everything you can invade any places he's invited to somebody's not invited to he's the most exciting single beings the most excited being in existence right now right now i see jesus can't come back right now the father's up there delegating through governmental stuff all the stuff that's going on right now on earth but the holy spirit well he didn't move his operations here that doctrinal person was right he did jesus said when i leave i will send who the holy spirit the comforter the one who will walk alongside hey walk alongside yeah unless you invite him in if you ever wonder what spiritual protocol is even in heaven you must invite okay you must invite i'll prove it you invited jesus christ right yes say yes he did we can take care of that right now [Music] you must invite jesus christ to be your savior repent of your sins invite him to come in this is all scriptural john 3 16 he will come into you he also has unlimited layers and he made you with unlimited layers of you everyone in here has layers that look just like you is this exciting yeah it should be it's the way you meet your soul your soul your emotions are all your layers the more emotional we are the more layers of you you have in you what does it do with those layers well when you get born again because you invited him right he takes one and he seats it in heavenly places and it's you it literally is it literally really truthfully is you it's a part of you it looks just like you still connected to your soul so all around your will let's say this is your will it's a strong column off of that from all these layers that look just like you but they move like they're living because they are this is a spiritual part of you not talking about your flesh your flesh suit is your flesh seep okay until it gets super glued together at the end that's glorified when you're glorified that'll happen one day okay you don't get glorified in heaven you can glorify when your spirit person who moves to heaven while your body rests or if it's blown up or eaten by a shark or burnt up to nothing he knows where every cell and molecule of you is this is true because some people think you can't get cremated say it's cheaper say it's cheaper your family member was standing right here said why didn't you cremate me you would have saved money and god will still put everybody back together again one day because is he going to leave all the people who were burnt out somewhere no no you get your body back say yay he's going to look a whole lot better [Music] your spiritual bodies didn't turn you right now you go man i look good because guess what everyone says in heaven man you look good you look funny you look good too but they recognize you it says so in the bible it says you will be known that means your images you'll be known as you were known on the earth so people will know you everyone in heaven knows your first name everyone's going to want a hug say no masks in heaven no social distancing in heaven no handshakes in heaven they give up hugs father abraham will probably be the first one if you make it to the gate because sometimes your family members are waiting outside the gate when you come up to heaven there's a landing place you come no matter how they bring you in jesus's own chariot somebody's chariot a spaceship a world war ii biplane whatever people come in many different things whatever would delight you the most is how you're going to be taken some people step in the elevator and they just go they don't want to mess around they're the people with few layers in their soul okay they got five layers just taken young their angels stepped in this spiritual elevator they step in with the person and up they go and they're there they bypass going to see the whole galaxies and everything which he will take you to see if you want to so even leaving is an experience is a powerful experience but you have layers in you and he made you that way number one spirit soul and body shall we count them say spirits that's a layer body that's a layer soul that's a layer even your body has layers right the skin the muscles the bones you have layers there's no way you can deny that you have layers your spiritual layers are some of the most exciting so people who have a lot of emotions down here probably going to be magnified in heaven your personality gets magnified in heaven yes the jokes are better okay number one there's nothing defiling nothing breaking nothing evil nothing that anybody couldn't see the movies are all clean the jokes are clean stay clean it's heaven most exciting intense beautiful amazing that would wonder and splendor and creatures you've never even seen before are there but he made you layer for different reasons okay so when this layer that you're wearing right now sleeps or like i said it's melted down or whatever happens to it's going to be okay god got it okay he's got that thing so yeah make sure you get cremated it's cheaper i meant people said i'm on i want to give my family member a funeral but would have been seventy thousand dollars of what i had to create it for seven months they're probably happy you did that because guess what we're all going to be back say we'll all be back we get our bodies back they will be young they will be timeless timeless there's no time in heaven everyone is young time doesn't go by okay it comes from god time comes from the father he's in charge of time okay he does things in heaven by events say by events on god's timeline it's whatever event is on there is what's happening there's an event right now it's not send jesus to get the people on the rapture rug that's not what's on there that's way way down way away okay say beginning of time i could draw a timeline all the way down to here [Music] we still have all of this left at least several hundred years maybe more i might still be here amen y'all want to be here during all that time yes are you sure about that no i am i've not been given an option when i said yes to do this and my family knows they already know i'll be here when they're gone their kids are gone their grandkids are going the great friends i'll still be here i'll make them some brownies because he chose me for that and i said yes you know john could have still been here say john that beloved the one who jesus loved will be very scriptural could have remained and be here right now if he chose that god's not a respecter you just have to say yes and you have to be willing yes is nice willing is better willing and obedient is what he needs okay for people who have commissions like that and that's not even my gift my gift i as you look at me i am a photographer my passion that i'd rather do 24 hours a day if i could would be photography i create moments in time that's how i look at it i don't just take a picture there is no taking picture if you take pictures around me i will correct you hold the camera up get the light on it before you bring it down if you stand there you're gonna have a shadow and all those things are outlined when i travel and speak overseas people always want to take pictures what's got a picture of the castle all their 15 friends are lined up you see the top of the castle if i can help you please if you all will stand like this leave a space for the castle then like this you'll all be in it but you can see the castle because this is what you take a picture of right now so that's what i am i was sent from god in my soul photographer when i go to heaven i'll have my own studio please come it'll be for free which is a joke because nothing costs anything anyway i will for sure have a studio because i know whatever gift he made you is what you would do in heaven is what you love the most that's how heaven uprights that's why there's so many things to do in heaven does that make sense to your head well most people thought we would just be worshipping you never stop because when you see all the things he made for you you will worship in the middle of the street anywhere everywhere you start shouting praises to god because he remembered all the things that you love amen there'll be pictures of some of your family members in your mansion and right now they take pictures that you if you lost if they were burned up in a fighter they'll be in your mountain on the wall it's one of the things he does i know i saw somebody's mansion and i saw siblings they have right now and i saw other ones like probably maybe i don't know 10 11 12 something like that they weren't even born yet and i know how many siblings this other person will have so people's mountains will be quite a delight to you your crowning room is massive because you get more than one crown [Music] he gives them out say he gives them out at one time we will throw a specific one we're not going to throw all of them at him we bury him maybe i don't know it's okay to laugh you need to know that humor is one of the number one things in heaven there is peace people go well peace be with them they die don't even rest in the arms of jesus they're not resting [Music] they're riding a roller coaster they're eating desserts somewhere because jesus loves desserts honey was his number one thing he ate while he was on the earth and guess what his cousin ate it too right what did johnny where's the last thing say it loud his family was hooked on honey jesus loved honey we made that that feast for them on the shore fish and it was honey he loves honey guess what he still loves me i have a jar in my pantry that says this is for jesus if he shows up i'm ready and to make this whole thing even funnier people don't think they'll laugh sometimes you laugh or cry when i talk about it sometimes you just don't know what to say because your your natural brains like blanked out a long time ago it's going to be in the ground anyway or where else it ever is but but i was the person in the family of 15 who wanted to number one be alone in a family of 14 siblings i always wanted to be alone was that ever going to happen do you think it was ever going to be about me say no really loud i wanted to be alone and i didn't care if anybody knew who i was i don't know if they knew my name i didn't want to hug anyone i didn't want to hug anybody that won't be kissed don't go to italy unless you want to be kissed if you go to a meeting 500 people you're going to get a thousand kisses because they don't just kiss you once they kiss you on both cheeks kiss kiss kiss kiss by these 400 people they had four four meetings they're making so much for my life so i want to be alone right i didn't want to be hugged or kissed i didn't want anyone to know me i knew two people and all of the schools i attended all three of my schools i knew two people that was it i wasn't seeking for people i was never part of a clique i was probably better off i wasn't a part of any of the crimes and other stuff i never got into that stuff because number one remember i could see i saw the demons around it you didn't have to ask me what hell was involved in heaven was i could see it so i didn't want any of that so here i am just wanted to be left alone that that wasn't going to happen in my life first of all i had to give myself to my family i was always on my parents side that made you unpopular had 150 pets to take care of the person we learned in the bible was how to do a funeral we sent every one of our pets to heaven don't argue with me about that i saw them there like every pet we ever have is in heaven my dad has him on his ranch every time he's someone i hear these words from my father in heaven he gets another one that was my dad's favorite words it was whatever he said about anything he he eat gas he gave himself to the world he loved his enemies literally he loved his enemies it ticked him off he loved everybody dragged him in our house got him a bed on the floor somewhere fed them found them jobs got them clothes helped them get a house that was my dad's part in the world was to be the love of god my brother rj said he was meant to kill wicked people we only did one meeting if you never met my brother rj you should search for someone yeah my brother despises injustice if he ever was a warrior he's the warrior he is the word he lives out in the wilderness away from everybody so he doesn't kill you know half the harvest before they get saved but he won't take down people who call the police i found the criminal you've been looking forward such as there he is already dad but they all know him so you know he's not going to hurt anyone that that didn't deserve it that's what he says our one meeting began together he let me go first and i was just talking about the love of god in heaven and everything then he gives her that high i'm rjs she was uh she was created by god she loved people i'm created to kill him it's a wicked this is the funny thing we were in a block church because almost no white pastors that time would invite me i might tell you something they weren't threatened by me because you know their whole culture they already had heaven culture right yeah and i have a lot about 50 000 black friends i love them all right and they might guess what righteousness truth they want all that they do again the line drawing news that's what god calls him the lion crying news but anyway so that's what he said i'm created to kill people who would take her out or kill people who are wicked and evil and belong to the devil he gets locked on death row he's about my height to minister to people who are about to be taken out yeah and he won't not look down he will not look down most people won't even go there's like three levels of bars between you and the people he'll walk up to the closest bars he can get to put his face right there and stare a hole in him and he move his eyes he'll just sit there and then they'll go like this who do you serve i started the living god of heaven on earth you made you carried you before you he gave you commission said he earth to bring life to people not to hurt them you need to know jesus christ because i know what hell looks like too and you'll burn forever and you won't like it they don't know what to do with him right he goes and gets all these prisoners one to jesus christ he won't back down he's certainly not back now and i won't tell you what he wants to do to those people in the barbed wire in dc so my siblings are very different from each other i learned to love everybody no matter where you're from where you're at you know i can honestly say i love you because god in me loves you so our job here is to love to share the truth right you don't have to force people to get saved you can't do that anyway it has to be a decision in here right and make a decision we just water it you know and share and then water it somebody else water then somebody wins them to jesus christ holy spirit draws them say holy spirit draws them it would be much harder with that holy spirit on the earth okay that's why he was sent way back in jesus time it wasn't easy to live that either but easy to live in the beginning right after jesus left but it certainly is different now and you were made by god very specific when he sent you he wrote words on the will on your will wrote on your actual will sometimes i can see him on people's will because i'm a seer i see spiritual things he wrote words of what he wanted you to be what he created you to be in the earth that book she writes every day of your life in you're in a book that's there you get it when you go to heaven this is what he intended for you this is what he purposed for you but sometimes the enemy got you off track sometimes wicked people did things he didn't intent and he he that was not his purpose he created the earth so he could take you from him where you live and when the time of conception comes holy spirit takes your little spiritual being and knits you together to that dot of flesh that's i knit you together in your mother's womb that's not putting your arms and legs down this nobody on this earth can do this spiritual thing nobody can even know where your spiritual being is the spirit of life talked about the bible was you you wrote in and out on the rays of the rainbow from the father they still do send me i want to i want to love people to send me i want to go to earth for you they'll say that to the father all the time that's what you did you played in the river of life inside him he jumped on the stones and fired a massive gemstones burning with his passion that's where everyone here came from everyone who's on the earth came from that place the father carries you in him in him we live we move we have our being the prophets and poets of the old have spoken of these things that means they will show that it reveals them where they came from everyone no matter what they believe or where they're at right now in this world came from him he is our father we are his offspring his heart is that you know him that you love him that you receive his son so you can be with him in heaven because jesus is the way back to the father and when anyone dies and they are caught up to heaven jesus meets you he walks you up the steps of the throne and says to his father here i have brought them home to you is part of his reward for dying for us he knows everything about you still loves you still wants you has purpose for your life here this is the thing about the babies this is awesome every baby when every baby was sent he wrote on their wills and by the way he wrote whether they were male or female yeah some other group can't teach anybody that i know they'd like to do that too by the way they wrote that on some piece of paper somewhere he wrote in here and when people try to be some other thing that they're not they have great conflict in their soul their soul fights against them because their soul already knows if you're male or female let alone what your body is saying to you they know that's what they were meant to be and i have talked to many people who switched that and have switched back and would all tell me the same thing i had conflict all the time in my soul it would fight and say no that's not you that is not you that's not how you were made you're meant to be i will tell you this there is going to be in one of these of god millions of homosexuals will get born again like like in a sudden a way and if they had operations they get their stuff put back on yeah talk about a sign and a wonder right here he's going to do it he's going to do that because he made us very specifically he made us detailed our personalities are different your personality is still different in heaven you're just nicer if you weren't nice down here you laugh and control me and you won't get to stop it either this place isn't heaven they go just for the laughter okay waves of it come out of places and hit you and just roll on the ground you never did that get used to it practice maybe then i saw a spot i was one of those people that didn't laugh i was so serious i was serious serious with the capital s i was serious i was serious i wanted everything to be done right that was me you know when my mom knew she left me the house would still be burning and not be burnt down that i'd know where everybody was and they'd be okay they may not be happy with me but but that was my assignment to keep everybody together and keep them safe and i i made like 10 sandwiches every day for their lunch and helped them with homework at night then if i was they were sick i've got to pray for them and sit with them until they were better and this was my life this was my life like young my life and i didn't say no to my parents i honored my mother and my father i get to do this now i get to have pink hair which was ordered by heaven okay i get to eat cake i still have to watch how much i eat okay i celebrate all the time because i already know i know what my end is i also pretty much know what your end is and it's because i'm willing have been taken back in the past and shown how things happen so i can give revelation taken forward in the future i've had glimpses of the new earth and all the other worlds around it i've seen father son holy spirit seven spirits of god melchizedek who is the father's high priest and always has been he has always had flesh on him i'm going to really mess with your mind now now has always had flesh before god made flesh on people on the earth he's really neat looking he serves the father at the obedience of the father he came to the earth became the king of salem collected tithes from abraham that's why he could see him he's also the one who's oh head of the tribe of angels that there's a whole tribe of angels that god put flesh on so you can send them to the earth as watch your angels not all of them fell everybody says oh my god not all of them some did some did not they have flush that's why they can make offspring i hope your answers are getting given okay but melchizedek still serves the father that's his position personal high priest to the living god the seven spirits of god also serve god they serve him they are his that means they serve him that doesn't mean that they're his seven attributes everybody every syllabus i've ever seen okay seven spirits of god here's the syllabus and in five minutes i can tell you what it is okay how to explain the trinity some people can't they think we have a three-headed god no they have the ability to step inside of each other father you know son holy spirit holy spirit steps in the father jesus steps in the father here's the three in one and that's how he showed me helped up to heaven said i'm going to show you the three in one and they all came i said here we are father son holy spirit in a couple minutes of time if there was time i understood what people have tried to figure out for years when he said jesus said father me and you when you and me he literally meant me inside you and you inside me and when they began to create before there was anything there was heaven the father's house there's nothing but the spirits around the father would step up where there's nothing he would speak physical realm jesus stepped out of him he was called the word stepped out and a drop of water in his hand he stretched it into a canvas and he wrapped it around just like this a huge part of the spirit realm and we created the physical round and then he began to hang the planets on there anything visible he couldn't hang physical things on a spiritual thing that's why spirits can walk through this physical wall because the original realm supersedes this physical realm which is temporal that's how he did it and from that moment they began to create everything in the physical realm we created the planets they didn't make the sun in the moon yet because the first earth when he made it the first time was lit with his glory millions of years between verse one mercy millions millions say millions i hope that messes up your mind too you know who doesn't mess it up it doesn't mess up scientists they ask the uh i'm not going to say astrological the astronomy people already have an understanding that this earth is well well over millions and millions and millions and millions of years old those who dig in the dirt and find the dinosaurs and the layers of the earth they already understand that man man man has been here for a limited time but the earth itself has been here for a very very long time so when there's darkness covering the earth because of what happened before that right in the beginning means before there was time in the beginning was when the earth was just a thought in god's head when he made the earth it was perfect it was beautiful there was no sin in it he said to watch your angels to watch over all the creatures that were on the earth the dinosaurs roamed the earth there was a water vapor shield around the whole earth that put mist on the ears because it hadn't rained there had been no storms yet on the earth there was only one landmass and all this ocean was around it how do i know he took me back in time and showed me how he created the heavens and the earth and when i explain this to an evolutionist they want to know god because they have answers to the questions they've always had what about that footprint they found by the dinosaur that was a watcher angel who had flesh on him so his footprint was in the dirt there's no crow magnum man there were never there never was a chromatin a man okay god didn't make people that were half ape and half person and put them on the earth okay we are we didn't come from monkeys say we didn't come from monkeys say we're made in the image of god he's not a monkey the angels laugh every time they hear us every time they watch the slime pool thing every time they watch someone talk about the big bang they laugh so hard they would cry if they could [Music] because that takes a lot more faith to believe than god making us putting us here right so having this involved very much in our lives always has been involved the angels are all over in here they all your angels are here and most of mine are outside because they couldn't fit in here and god gave me promises all kinds of promises just said yes i'll do this for you however long it takes i don't care he said one day i'll open their eyes everybody will see the angels one day i'll take everybody to heaven so everybody raise always do this raise your hand up say we're ready right now take us for a trip let's see if it happens not today that may seem strange to some people but one day it will be happening the closer we get towards the end and the end for people might be the rapture but i can tell you this all the stuff in the bible is going to happen it will all happen the tribulation the perilous times it's going to happen christening on the third jerusalem is going to happen for that thousand years satan being taken off the earth during the time is going to happen he'll be back on the earth to tempt all the ones who were born people lived to be seven eight nine hundred years old during that time uh if you died at 100 that would be like a child say timelessness is coming to the earth before them yes it said that there would be a generation of people on the earth that would taste of the powers of the age to come the age to come after this age we're in is the millennial age so he's not done with this one yet it's not going to end okay but there would be people living in your time i'm saying over the next couple hundred years in this time who will be timeless will begin not to age who will travel to the spirit realm all the time rather than the physical realm who do amazing signs and wonders for him that's why he needs this time right now to clean a lot of the evil off of the earth he can't even send new inventions there's inventions that haven't happened yet that will actually make our life so much easier and so different that he won't put them here until the evil is pushed back say god is not willing to give those inventions to the wicked if you see his big picture about all this is happening you will understand why all the evil is being exposed and it's being exposed all over the world why is this happening say god's going to clean that platform off collard so we can step into the greater days of glory that's why if everything had happened is normal and there's all kinds of stuff going on we didn't know if everything had happened as normal on november 3rd then a lot of that would never be found out it wouldn't be known the evil wickedness would still be there hiding plotting and planning and god isn't going to do some things until a lot of them are taken off who understands please raise your hand if you were god and you had great things to send to the earth would you allow all that to remain and you can see just in our country alone how that has interfered you can imagine saying no holds barred for anybody easier than what you want to it would be really hard to have any of that happen right so he does have a plan it is going to we are having justice it will come not just here but around the world and there's be some people here you will see no more see there'll be people here say it wicked people who will be here no more that is his plan amen amen so you're living in different days this is all different our lives have had to be different right it's going to be worth it for what is coming that no man can stop or interfere with and your family member is going to be running to you to find out who jesus christ is there's going to be a lot of salvations happening because people number one are going to know there's a god because only god could do all what's going to be done so on god's timeline we're right there at one of his things right now on his timeline right now we're there so everybody here is born because he needs you here he wants you here okay no one is a mistake no matter how you got here or who he sent you to he never purpose evil for you or harm or tragedy so everybody's seeing enough we're going to do oh we're going to do a soul checkup and i do it for the sake of those who probably wouldn't ever do it this is available to the body of christ to be free of everything that's hindered you hurt you any tragedy anything that happened in your life that you keep having memories of maybe even nightmares about you won't have them no more if you're involved in addictions and you sincerely lose that addiction from your soul he'll come down and pull out of you amen and this is something the father taught me himself it's the first time i actually looked at my clock and then he told me that i'm going to teach you something and i looked at my clock it's all the time when i came back it was four hours later my staff had been beating on my door my daughter come over to see me and i didn't answer anybody my body was there i wasn't there he took me and showed me how he made a human soul why he mean it that way how important it is to understand the fullness of the peace of the kingdom i'm telling you about the keys of the kingdom that's what this is you call it something else he calls it a soul checkup you should do it all the time i used to teach it once and then that was nice and i found out a few weeks later no this is a lifestyle if someone says something horrible bashing hurting to you you turn around loose those words from your soul and him will go and it will be to you like they never happened if you saw traumas if you had tragedies if you lose that tragedy from your soul he'll come down and go shh it'll be like it never happened to you you can talk about it there's no hurt there's no fear there's no suffering no matter what it was you don't have to have that in you he doesn't want it in you his explanation to me was i don't have time for them to have six weeks or six months or six years of therapy i don't have that kind of time i need them free i need them free right now that's why i'm going to teach you this and if you're willing to learn it and train them then i will show you who melchizedek is you give me promises i'll do this for you and i didn't ask him i'll do this for you do this video i'll do this for you and of course you know i said yes i know you'd be the whole world i'd be training that's okay it's the most important thing you probably learn other than knowing jesus christ you can walk through your life with no pain no suffering no fear no grief no traumas no addictions now it may try to come back to you saying nope i got rid of you i'm not taking you back and the devil will try to bring back whatever he can you say nope it's gone and i've done this with too many people for you to try to tell me it doesn't work it does work so if you're a born-again believer you can do this okay so first i always start with we're all going to repent and say father father i come before your throne i come before you i love your son jesus christ i love you right now i'm going to clean up my salt right now i'm going to clean it up i repent of any sin since my original repentance i don't want any of it in me so i'm giving it back to your son i thank you jesus thank you jesus for cleansing my soul for blessing my soul that i can be free of all sin amen amen now we're going to do this soul checkup i will list things that you need to lose from your soul but if i don't say something you can say that yourself and everyone does it so nobody's going to be figured out or pointed out the one thing i will see is stuff leaving you i'ma the seer i will see jesus come down he pulls gray matter out of you that's what it looks like it looks like gray because you have the light of god but if you have darkness in there if you play with sin or play with stuff and the enemy looks in you he will see gray he will go after you he'll already go after you so that's why number one you don't want to keep it right he also doesn't want people bashing screaming yelling because you sound like hell when you do that our words are supposed to bring life yes amen we're here to bring light and love and life those three things that's why you're here so if you have anger issues there's something in your soul that keeps making you do that so you can lose anger from your soul it won't ever come back again don't go watch 10 movies with profanity in them i have to say this about profanity that is hell's language you are literally speaking the language of hell if they hear enough they're going to start showing up because they recognize those words that's why god says no profane word should come out of your mouth there it is right there no profane words should be spoken by you amen it's not in heaven no one in heaven talks like that i've been to hell three times and it was filled that's the only language they speak so we don't want to represent now we're not here for that right and i'm sure you may have good reasons to get angry or upset it says you can be angry and sin not okay don't add that to your list we're not supposed to wound people with our words so please don't bash people when people they say this when people lash out at you they're afraid fear causes people to lash out they'll never admit that they won't even think that but fear makes you lash out that's what happens and i always know that person needs help if they're bashing me they need help and so that's how i look and that's how god has taught me to look at it so we should always be here to help people if people don't like you or they're mean to you please forgive them go in a room forgive them loose all of it out of your soul whatever it is maybe teach little kids do this even little kids if they're if they're bashed at school or bullied at school you as their parent can lay your hand on their head and say as a watcher over their soul i choose to loose from my child's soul all the hateful mean ugly words that were spoken to him today i loose them in jesus name and jesus will come down and pull them out of the soul of the child and those children will act like it never happened you have the right to do that because you're the parent amen so this is something you can live do for the rest of your life when something happens immediately to you that's the best time to do it if you're in grief i understand you miss somebody but don't let that grief still be there a year two years three years five years like don't build like a memorial it's okay to put the pictures on the wall i'm saying don't go in there and reap over them all the time they're in heaven saying please have a life they're up there saying please laugh please let it go please release me some people if your parents or loved ones have died and you're still grieving you need to say these words i choose with my will to release my loved one into the hands of jesus to complete whatever destiny he has for them in heaven when you do that they will hear that in heaven number one it will make them very happy it will remove grief out of you that didn't leave yet okay you don't want a spirit of grief which doesn't go in here but will speak to you all the time about how horrible it was that they died they repeat how they die they don't think about how they died they just know one thing they're happy they're there and people got saved in the last minute are really happy they're there they made a beautiful three-level cabin on the river of wherever in heaven but they may not have a mansion the size of new york city but you know they're not upset with anyone who has something greater because those people that was a reward for their life amen so we're going to say i choose i choose as the believer in jesus christ the believer in jesus christ to lose from my soul every anger purple bashing [Music] i lose [Music] i lose that from my soul every fear every year every i'm trying to think of what the words are some natural words um they'll come in just a minute i lose any fear any oppression any depression any thoughts of suicide i loosen from my soul at least from my soul any hate any vengeance any effects and the unforgiveness and it was spoken against me that i was involved that were spoken against me out wrongfully against me i lose all of that and lose all of that from my soul from my soul jesus name i lose from my soul any pornography any pedophile any wicked defiled things that i looked at before watched they were forced for [Music] and he laughed any poverty any poverty any wealth that was stolen i forgive those people in jesus name i was not made to live i am not keeping it in jesus name can attack me in any of those ways i lose it from my soul in jesus name i lose from my soul any unrighteousness anything it took me beyond what god allows what god loves beyond the boundaries he except for us as believers i lose all that from my soul at least from my soul and he failed and he failed here any thoughts of failure any failed activities or businesses or plans or plays of the enemy he took me out of them i will not i will be associated with failure i am above i am not beneath any thoughts any thoughts of being beneath me i will not keep them against any any hurting crippling crushing controlling words that i spoke over others i boost them from my soul i lose from my soul deep sadness unfounded sadness that has no ground i will not keep that in my soul i was [Music] any deceiving words that were spoken to me or about me that i heard on the news any fake news i would lose from my soul any lies about this time any corruption that i heard spoken i use all of that i will not make judgments from that i loose it all for myself in jesus name any thoughts i've had of being unimportant and not measuring up not being what god wanted me to be those words did not come from god i will not keep those thoughts i will not keep those take them captive loosen from my soul in jesus name and we're going to wait a few minutes while he just pulls all that out and [Music] now we're going to bind the things of god to our soul this is one way you can stay happy every day of your life you choose to be happy you choose to be what god called you to be no matter what's going around you but when those things aren't in you it's much easier but if you want the fullness of god you can ask for more than just your rent being paid food on your table you know things that need to be fixed or hold us fine but he wants you to be more than that you have not because you asked not today we're going to ask to have things bound to our soul when you do that he comes and he puts them in you some of them come in waves i see whole waves of the joy of the lord whole waves of his presence whole waves of his life so we're going to who do you are you all ready to ask for them yes say i choose as an act of my will to bind to my soul my soul the love of god the love of god the life of god the light of god the presence of the lord the joy of the lord his creativity his creativity his expectations yes his validation my gift that he gave this word i will meditate on all the time all the time in jesus name i bind to my soul the goodness of god and it will be evident the life of god and it will come for me the glory of god that we are seated in christ christ in me is the hope of glory that i bind to my soul i bind to my soul his will his plan to release it to the just in the righteousness that promise my mind to my soul by him to my soul sound wisdom extreme discernment i can operate for him the way he needs to be in jesus name so be it [Applause] amen [Music] he has great plans for all of us and it doesn't depend on your age your position doesn't depend on anything but one thing you belong to his son right do you mean that decision to accept christ and his sacrifice i know a lot about things that happened the day that he died on the cross a lot about what happened from the moment his he had his spirit leave his body i think if he hadn't told him to leave he might still be there because he did he commanded the spirit mentally leave his body and his body was taken down it was placed in the tomb god appointed two angels to be with christ through many different times in his life if it said angels came and comforted him it was the same two angels that they were always with and they were with him in the garden they were chosen to bring that cup that cup is a real cup the thing he drank all the wickedness and evil and every sin and wickedness that existed he drank that that's what had to be nailed to the cross it wasn't just his physical body it's what he carried to the cross if people ask you how come jesus is the only one who can forgive sins you tell them that he's the only one to drink all of the evil of every single sin into his being and was willing to nail back to the cross and at that time he can abolish sin in our lives when we repent is the only one who's done that he's the only one who's made that sacrifice willing so he is the only one that has the power to forgive sin and he is the only way back to heaven someone else has another heaven good luck the one i saw belonged to the god of the bible his son jesus christ holy spirit so many angels millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of angels i've seen in heaven around in heaven all over the earth they belong to him amen he made them for specific purposes they're made in tribes like there's tribes of watcher angels tribes of couriers trying of scribes and then there is the army of heaven that is a whole different creature when it talks about the living creatures before the throne of god you're pretty much describing most of the army of heaven they don't look normal they don't look like human eye and they have wings whether you ever see them or not some are made out of just force i can't even explain that they they don't have any kind of shape that you can identify some have eyes some have 30 eyes some have eyes all over their body some have eyes in the front in the back some have two heads front and front i'm not going to explain that hello hello i was present when they brought a gift to my grandson when he was born and he is a carrier of the love of god and he's going to be an athlete who will win olympics and he's focused he's got two things in his life he's so focused i can't figure his brain out he can run faster than his father or anybody who's ever tried to beat him but what he will talk to you about is the love of god he was assigned these two angels who were one being and their names are passion and compassion and they're with him all the time he has other angels who are with him uh his main angel's name is flash your number one angel assigned to you is because of the gift you have mine is about 40 foot tall i've never seen him when i was a little tiny thing i could see him following me around all the time i apologize to him all the time you probably shouldn't have heard me say that i'm sorry then he grins at me sometimes he rolls his eyes at me but not often he's there to protect me to watch over me sometimes he'll bring me things from heaven and but but this grandson's angels always uh oh i know all my brain kids angels actually speak to them hi thank you for watching over them you know they're going to be going here i know you know that but just pay attention and and so yeah the one who's fast is almost the speed of light the first one is the first friends and is very creative he started making trips to him when he was three he seen my dad talk to my dad described my dad he never met my dad on the earth my dad keeps giving his favorite candies candies were around in the 50s that they don't even have anymore he's gone inside of a volcano in heaven and rode the lava hound with my dad he described cars that could drive up the side of mountains without wheels they exist in heaven i never told him about that he's been making trips now for five years and he'll just say the most surprising things come out of his mouth nobody's saying anything he could lead a service baptized so get people saved baptized in water cast demons out they have never been a trim in the public school that was probably a good thing you'd be down the principal's office all the time your son just baptized someone in the water fountain again and he would yeah and the second one is over the love of god will pray for everybody if he sees anyone limp in the store anyway he'll run up to them in jesus name be healed and the third one is a girl and she would be she will dance and sing and there will be weapons she'll be very fierce they should named her middle name fierce and i got two pages on her before she was born one whole one and a half pages of how fierce it she'll be she is fierce she runs for brothers she totally understands things from god she's for sees things here's things her passion to worship surpasses everything else she's got she's all about worship singing and dancing and now she's wanting to learn to play the violin i'm sure that will be very dangerous to hell when she does that because what you do in worship is dangerous against hell your prayers are your worship is however you do that by that's painting danger to how when you sing dance if you flag whatever it is that you do is worship you create images that are captured and taken before the throne of god so she's fierce her angel that protects her is the size of a mountain his name is rock and he's got this little tiny person that he follows around you know i every time i visit wherever they're all at i thank them all the time for watching over them and so i know their names i know what they will be one of my rewards god loves children she needs children you are not just raising a child you are shaping souls to the kingdom and i talk more about the kingdom usually than i do the actual world that's why christ came he came to tell us about the gospel of the kingdom it wasn't just about dying that's just how everything begins with you ruling and reigning in the spirit realm is what he actually has for you you rule with him because he rules we have ultimate authority in this earth over this earth over anything in this earth everything of satan has been put under our feet we have power over all say all the power of the enemy we're going to learn how to use it we are he's starting something new brand new right in the middle of all this time actually gave all the revelation about it on the day of the fake inauguration it will happen the body will learn who they are what your authorities in the spirit realm how to use that authority how to crush darkness push it back it'll be a different life to live in this world amen demons will run from you they won't try to attack you they will try to get away from you because what you carry will cause great pain to them yes the light and the glory of god is painful to the enemy that's why when it showed up in hell on the third day they were screaming their faces were melting they couldn't get away from christ fast enough that is what it's going to be like to live in this world with you so you're not unimportant you're not just a person you're not an old sinner say by grace don't ever say that again you are considered royalty in heaven your manifested sons and daughters of the most high god you are the love of jesus christ life he gave everything for you that's how much he loves you holy spirit can't wait to get to know you better he will share things with you that will probably undo your natural mind because heaven is not this world it's only a shadow earth is a shadow of what is in heaven and what he has waiting for all of us now in this life probably won't be repeated again what he starts now will continue until the end of this age and even those christians who would become christians during the tribulation will be a thorn in the flesh of satan they won't be crying they won't be hiding when it comes time it's going to be executed i've already been shown that they will be dancing in the line which would be the biggest irritation to say who finding things i'm really going to get them now they'll already know they already had trips to heaven by that time a lot of people will be uh it will be normal for people to be caught up to have many times doing greatest some of the greatest things on the earth until things begin to switch okay i cannot tell you for sure that the body will not be on this earth when that happens but i will just repeat what the word says until he that is with hell is removed the antichrist cannot appear on the earth well i can tell you what if we were all here he would be able to do nothing he is not here anywhere in the earth right now god wouldn't be starting these greater days of glory with so much power of god being seen and felt and known in the earth satan would not be able to fulfill his thing his few years his bump in the road that's what god says he gets a bump in the road he won't be able to operate that operate like that in those days people will be looking for a savior someone who can rescue them from the horrific perils times which will also be a short time they will take anybody okay so who shows up is the antichrist and he's actually going to be good for the first three and a half years to fool everybody he only does all the evil stuff the last three and a half years and he still won't get the whole world i don't know why people think he will he won't there's going to be rednecks here that will not want him that will not take satan even during the tribulation and there will be people on the earth when christ comes to sit on the thorn in jerusalem that didn't die even during that time and they will have a long time to make their decision for christ you have still have to get saved even during the time when christ is on the throne and some of those kings how about this want one in there knowing he's the son of god knowing he will actually control the weather and all these other things he will sit as king of the world and they will want in there so the satan is loosed 1 000 years later out of the pit he will have no authority or power in the earth for that 1000 years christ will have holy ruling in the earth there will be people who survive the tribulation that will live here during that time so sometimes you'll understand things sometimes you had a big picture given to you right now we still have a long way to go but at this point in history in heaven and on the earth are the greater days it's not the darker days amen i know some pastors if they don't have revelation and they don't know what's going on they always go to the end this is the tribulation everybody get ready for all this to happen it's not going to happen evil is not taking over this world right now it's actually going to be diminished for a very long time so thank you for letting me share make sure you make it tomorrow i will be talking about america i'll be wearing my red white and blue amen stand up so i can speak a blessing i'll just tell you we have stuff back there you might be interested in i almost never get to share about it but we do have some things i just sincerely want to speak a blessing over your lives if you don't come tomorrow well then i will just speak over you tonight amen raise your hands father i thank you for your children that are here tonight god who paid a price to be here their time their energy their efforts god and right now father i release to this room the healing power of jesus christ whether it is emotional whether it's physical whether it's mental in jesus name i speak wholeness to your bodies to your minds to your spirits in jesus name that you will walk out of your hole totally and completely the way he made you in jesus name and anybody watching online i release that to you also wholeness in your body wholeness in your mind wholeness in your emotions in jesus name and god i ask for specifically those who are here and those watching online god that you give a download of your wealth to each and every person here father a god that you have a desire in your heart you don't have to wait until that great transfer happens father you may show them your goodness by changing their finances in one week god i want to hear reports of the miraculous father the unexpected the suddenlies that are already starting in this world god let it happen to everyone who is present god and everyone who's watching and not because they have to know you love them but because i want you to do it for them i am willing and obedient god and i thank you for a blessing for myself that you will let every single person here experience the unexpected suddenlies from your hand in jesus name i declare it to be so and everyone said amen i receive it thank you amen

of Revelation in this in this place tonight and Lord we welcome the Angels tonight we welcome signs and wonders and miracles in this place tonight [Music] so come a Holy Spirit even now we love you we welcome you in this place thank you Jesus thank you Lord now I feel like the Holy Spirit is this gonna thicken his presence right now there's some of you who have been crying out I gotta have more I'm not satisfied I gotta have more and God has been stirring your heart he's been blowing on the coals of your heart the flames of your heart to ignite it into a mighty blaze and so lo let tonight be that night why wouldn't he do it tonight [Music] Jesus said blessed are the hungry are you guys hungry tonight yeah blessed are those who hunger and thirst come on how many want to be blessed tonight we've got a hunger and thirst for him and for his righteousness and you'll be filled and so Lord fill us tonight we pray or we want to step out of the natural into the supernatural realms of the kingdom of God into that place where all things are possible tonight we pray thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen well welcome good to have you I think we're gonna receive an offering right now if we are the ushers ready so we're gonna receive an offering when a hundred percent goes to Kat Kerr ministries and if you if you're making a check make it to the healing rooms and also if you need use a credit card you could just raise your hand or if you need an envelope we'll give you an envelope for tax purposes just raise your hand so we you get many ways you can give tonight well I don't know about you but I'm really expecting it's been a great day today so far and we haven't seen anything yet and so again we want to welcome you to the Healing Rooms Apostolic Center and you know I I just I always say this because it happens almost every time we meet together you just may be healed it happens in the glory here all the time we have so many angels here on assignment and I just I just got a feeling some of New York and just going to get healed you know a lot of times it happens during worship happens during the word and so we definitely haven't opened heaven and this is a place where miracles happen so when you feel the presence of the Lord we like to say it like this just reach out reach out and touch him and receive your miracle tonight all right it's been excited we were living in supernatural times and this has been a supernatural week I'm sure every here knows that Paul Kane went to be with the Lord last Tuesday evening and today was the afternoon when his body was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just different the signs and wonders happening throughout the week and and so I know that we're in the midst but we're always in the midst of the supernatural but it just seems like something special and so we invited Kat a while ago and of course nobody but God knew that Paul was gonna go home and actually be buried on the first day when she's speaking and I know that it's not a coincidence I don't know exactly what it means maybe she does but I know stuff like that is not just a coincidence so we're really blessed and honored Kat to have you here again and I'm sure how many of you have never been in a live cat care meeting Oh a lot of you good you're in for a treat so why don't you can make your way up Kat you need to come up around this way and yeah you ready oh and while she's coming up somebody dropped their glasses so if that's you you probably can't see but here they are when I put them up here so Kat um well brought those in you don't know the Lord's been taking her to heaven for several years and showing her things and bringing her back and allowing her to share with us so let's just welcome cat Kirk [Applause] Wow [Applause] I know some people know why I'm saying that some may not when the army of heaven goes to battle against the darkness that is their war cry why because they're excited you're gonna crush the enemy's plans over you right they're gonna crush them they're gonna pull down strongholds that have been rising against you that's why they were created news flash from heaven they weren't created to protect heaven they were made by the creator of heaven they didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third of the angels out then you get to do that Michael hell them and the Father sent a lightning bolt a million megawatts of love from himself and took him out and then one third of angels went out the same way so they've been waiting a long time to war on our behalf full time amen I may or may not give you scripture for that tonight go look it up I think most of us know that Jesus was the lord of state loud the host is the name of the army of heaven yes they're still part of the angel tribes but they're different in many ways the ones under Gabriel have many different positions and jobs in heaven and on the earth and they look more like us they're the ones who look more like us the army of heaven mostly does not look anything like us they're creatures most of them are creatures they're fierce looking they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps so what the Holy Spirit says they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps however there was one time when they had to take the place of the worship angels which were the one-third that were kicked out the only ones Lucifer got were the ones he was over he was over one-third of the angels was the worship angels obviously if he was the one who led them in worship all the time in heaven I'm just gonna give you full out Revelation because I want to take advantage of all the time I have so if you didn't know this he used to step inside God to lead worship he covered over the very heart of God with his wings which were embellished with gems he had gems on his back on his front people go well he had just a few no he had really hundreds of them on him and when God made him he made mountings like in a ring and every gem was mounted and amounting like a ring that you would wear like this one here and he was beautiful which is one of the reasons why he ended up by falling from pride from his beauty also he thought he was smarter than God and that was a that was busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz you're gonna laugh a lot tonight alright heaven laughs every time the devil loses down here all of heaven roars yes they know what's going on and today they were attendants for Paul Cain with Paul Cain not talking about the body talk about his spirit man everyone gets to see their own homecoming isn't that nice so we're colors and play lots of music and dance because that's what they'll be doing in heaven news flash from heaven number two they don't have a funeral in heaven when you come home say Amen you shouldn't expect one we should have a party zone down here when we send people off instead of a funeral home someone opened a party zone I promise you'll make more money than other people with funeral homes cuz even the world will want to send theirs off wherever they think they're going they'll pick a party anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea I've been giving up for years I don't think anybody's done it yet so there you go the more real heaven becomes to the body of people will want to send them off with a real celebration because of the reality of what heaven is and what they're going to be experiencing there it won't make sense to have a sad funeral while they're watching from the party I'm a seer that means I see in the unseen realm okay mister I'm really happy Danny because I got to experience all that heaven was doing and what was going on with Paul Kane and his mother and his sisters you know his family that's up there and the others who were attending up there watching his service he enjoyed every funny thing that was told he likes to be real so he liked all the reality of who he was he liked that personal side of him being talked about so next time you plan a family members homegoing service tell some jokes because they will laugh I was at a service one time and back home and it was um trying to member the guys name I remember told McClellan he was part of story side B and he died suddenly and I came into his service I didn't know anyone but I was coming to bring some books about heaven to his family the Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him watching from the portal that was really difficult you know to try to pretend to be sad and I never wear black it's okay if you if you go to somewhere where they're expecting you know to do what is proper not to upset them but no one's wearing black in heaven they're not and they aren't having to partying there was I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what I don't know you know helps my human head lots of times because they kind of took that away from me I used to be kind of brilliant really then they made me like eight years old life is much easier being that way you know what you don't worry about things you don't think about what's gonna happen five years down the road when you don't even know or you already planned you know prepare for disasters or something I never got that really if we're over the weather then we shouldn't be concerned about the weather we rule over it amen okay she didn't know news bulletins number three writes number three are you keeping track you're gonna get a gift number three Jesus was over the weather we are joint ears we get to be over the weather and that great you're gonna see that more and more I'm serious you're gonna see it more and more things stop like stop can't wait for that to happen meteorologists might have to get another job not making fake news by the way they don't work now and it's not gonna work when it's not actually happening what was I talking about number three boys over over the weather Jesus was over the weather and he tried so hard to teach his disciples he really was in case you didn't know they were in boot camp with him for three years it wasn't just watch what I do it's learn what I do and then do it right he was gonna go he's gonna go back for some R&R and he had to make sure they understood how this whole thing works being a joint heir with Christ what do you have we have he said so himself the things I did how point-blank can you get the things and the works I have done you will do well you forgot the first part you will do also okay these are just the works you got to do the works say we got to do the works then we get to do the greater say it louder okay like you're excited well I don't just try things I actually do them there's a difference I'm just gonna try that means you're not making much of a plan about that right but doing it the works I did you will do they do also and greater works you will do I think that means we're socially doing something we're entering into a busy season a busy season operating in the supernatural not just talking about it a busy season handling the wealth of the wicked not just talking about it a busy season living not just existing doing the more say the more the more is amazing are you getting better I am just as passionate about living holy as I am about being funny and I will tell you I I have to I have to give you both sides of heaven there's two sides in heaven there's holy profound the other whole half of heaven is funny say funny everybody have they've thought for ever and for ages that it would be boring in heaven maybe because all they do is worship let me tell you you stand in front of him it's not boring whether you're staring feeling like you're going to faint melting to the ground you know you feel like you don't have breath in you because of just being near him yeah it is an honor a privilege and amazing when you worship and it's not normal not even worship as normal in heaven you ride on it you create things as you're worshiping him you're creating when you worship given the devil a big black eye and a very bad day when you worship Him you are shredding bashing and crushing his fake little wannabe Kingdom in the second heaven when you worship Him it's amazing from doing one thing for him to honor him to bless him to adore him what destruction you do against the kingdom of darkness that's my favorite second thing I don't do demons I do do Jesus though I love him I honor him I can't do anything without him it's because of him and with him and it is his plan even the pink hair is his plan because he's not boring there's nothing boring about him there's absolutely nothing boring about heaven there's nothing boring about our future that's like in the next few days the more you believe things are real the more real they will become and that is actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit realm truth the more you believe it is real and talk about it being real and write about it being real and actually acting in it being real the more real it's going to become to you it's the original realm it's the eternal realm it's not the temporary realm this is a temporary life for you it's a temporary place to live a temporary to do things because this earth is not eternal I know people have worked it out in their own mind with their head research and they're looking up stuff and sometimes assuming because I've read a lot of translations and someone kind of miss it I know because the Holy Spirit shows me those scriptures then he'll show me 30 scriptures of it being translated I take the word for the value it gives it's real it is for us to repair us to accelerate us to propel us into high places you never dreamed of doing things you never dreamed of we are living examples of the Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth that's why you're here you here to be like them look like them and act like them I don't see any failure in any of that I don't see hopelessness worthlessness I don't see fear at all one of the first things the Holy Spirit gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what we decided to call him there's so many we don't know what to call and we didn't just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a Kingdom quote was don't let fear interfere that was a good one right teach me never to fear never say never at all in any way fear does not control our life we do not partner with fear he didn't put fear in us when he made us we're supposed to be fearless and timeless everybody should be yelling I receive it say timeless we're supposed to be timeless he said you had to die I'm being serious not funny now serious John didn't have to die did he say no didn't Jesus say to the disciples what is it so in other words he's saying it doesn't matter what they think you probably actually said that he's a character he's the son of God but he is a character the problem with the biggest characters in heaven except for Holy Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by that much who they called the drama King Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit is a drama King you haven't only seen just a little bit of his activity so far waiting to the full fledge release on this earth he's excited he's excited about what's about to happen in us they've been waiting a long time say they've been waiting a long time if I say the word day I mean the Trinity they're not boring none of them they know how to step inside of each other and be one one thing that's how it happens I know I was eight years old father caught me up before the throne and said I'm going to show you how the three can be one and a five-year-old can understand that man's head knowledge has expanded it and expanded it and all kind of could use every other kind of word explaining that you know multiply it whatever you want to call it made it look amazing powerful and hard to understand it's simple they can step inside of each other Jesus said father I pray that one day that they be one even as we are one because he steps inside his father all the time when he was the word he did the same thing I didn't forget I was only on number three bulletins by the way I've got some more I was the least likely person to anyone on this earth would have chosen to do this okay I'm from a tribe like a real one 15 people in an alligator and an iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs and lizards and spiders we grew up with them in our home I had seven brothers what did you think in Florida you add that up that's what that comes to sell your bike to some kid for a pig bring him home wrap him up and close and you have a new pet overnight we never knew what was going to be in our home so I didn't need anyone's opinions I was never part of a group or a clique I had a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a dead person standing before you dead people are wonderful for God to use they're not full of self they don't have their own opinion and the devil cannot use a dead person the more dead you are to yourself the more dangerous you are against hell there are many ways to kill me before I even grew up and you know it doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in this room I loved all my siblings I survived I conquered I was a leader wasn't liked all the time but I was a big help to my parents I honor my parents greatly every day of my life I loved them I didn't want to hurt them they needed help say parents they need help pastors they need more help I'm grateful people can start a church Oh No I've already died I don't need a church I don't need a whole congregations of people although I love them I bless you all but I really bless the pastor because they die every day to be that amen you'll notice that God didn't actually send his son to be a pastor did you ever notice that they actually sent him as a businessman God loves business people they're easy they know how to listen they know how to complete things that are given to them they don't leave things out forget things ignore things they do a job amen so he sent his son as a businessman who could easily connect with the sinners and he did they ate with him all the time they liked him he was exciting he was interesting he was funny his favorite job was to offend the hierarchy he was good at it and yet lived holy did miracles raise the dead they took money from people for spotted lambs they weren't high on God's list and he had to train his disciples I know he only had him for three years and I think most of them finally got it after he left but they did give him credit they did but in the beginning I'm sure Jesus would go to the Father when he went to the mountain all the time and say are you sure I have to that fight all the time they brawl over women I have one who wants to be everything until everybody that that would be Peter I have a treasure you know that cheats all the time right you know that you know he takes money all the time I know you know that too and I have a tax collector and every time you walk down the road to go Minister we get stones thrown at us because they don't like him I don't know anybody who likes tax clusters they didn't back then either so he did not give him the best or the easiest to Train and I know I was saying something to God about my some of my staff and he said I didn't make it easy for my son in my conversation ended with that subject especially when he caught me up me took me back and I got to walk through a whole day of their lives like in their first year of being together all right God I can make it God has a plan for you every single person is important to him and I do know this your birth was timed on this earth God created time he knew you before you were born because you played inside of him he saw you if there was time he saw you all the time how great is see that he was huge he could make himself as big as he wanted to and he walked on the mountains he was out where there was nothing and he spoke and the world would step out of him and make space that God would make himself small enough to step inside himself and play with you he did say he's not a man he's God and even being that great he knew everything about you knew the mistakes knew our faults knew everything that had great hope and great plans for you to do great things so it's no mistake you're here now in this age instead of the ages before this time you're here right on time for the accelerator time for the more of God for the kingdom age for the time to command the hosts of heaven handle the wealth by host cities for him to use because he's not poor he knows the names of your children that you'll have even before you get married he knows them and he put them in your family line on purpose in this generation that's here now this is a special generation for God it's the beginning of the group and type of people that will remain until all things be fulfilled some well the Bible says there'll be a group of people like that a group and type of people a generation that we're generation means a group and type of people it doesn't mean like 30 years or actually that word in the Bible that says Jesus says that there'll be a group and Type O people on earth that will be here when all things be fulfilled including the coming of him that word means a group and type of people that work generation means that there will be a grouping type of people on this earth that also says in the Bible that would taste of the powers say powers of the age to come that would be the Millennial age of course there's people now let's say they're not going to be in millennium I go about what the Bible says there will be a millennium there will be a Tribulation God caused a bump in the road it will happen that's on his timeline in heaven so no matter what other people have come come up with or assume or have putting in translations I promise you it's going to happen and you can't make it happen or not happen anyway so to me it's not worth agreeing over God's gonna work out his plan all the way to the end right I'm excited to know that I'm part of that generation that will tasted the powers of the age to come that's why you need revelation because that that all that comes from the heart of God he already knows what it's going to look like she knows what's gonna happen so he chose you to be here to be a part say Amen that word means so be yet might as well say it gonna happen there's no one on the earth in the earth around the earth say it's round I gotta say that the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so that's him say the earth is round not flat they don't have edges you may say that property does not have edges there you go Holy Spirit truck can we use proper grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it there is a whole group of people that sincerely spend so much time and money to try to prove the earth is flat I'd rather use that money in that time and energy ruling right I've flown many times and I didn't get halfway around the world then all of a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait shh now you're on the other side no I went around besides I've already been up over the earth it's round God made it round he says he sits on the circle of the earth not the square you'd be surprised how serious they are they think NASA has spent billions of dollars faking it and none of that stuff is real I don't know who got that thought but it didn't come from heaven a man so just rest assured that it's around okay been there seen that it is round and when I almost shown it God caught me up in space up and do like like first space not I've been way up there but the first time he caught me up and showed me the earth he put a grid you know like a grid you know what that is yeah a grid was round and he put it right on the earth cheol-ho together and then they begin to draw things on this grid that was his plan that was called space planning that was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out in space put the grid than planned right uses every opportunity to be funny so he did show me his space planning for like the next hundred years that was probably 15 20 years ago when he showed me that that doesn't mean the earth is going to end in a hundred years except been taken further than that and no tribulation had happened I know some people think it's supposed to be right now well if it was it would be people get to heaven they all find out man we wasted so much time sitting on our rapture rug she to roll it up put it in the closet well you've you've been around a long time you realize I went to church everyday it was open and every day someone said Jesus could come tomorrow and in my I'm like little this is like little I had these thoughts why would he have all these plans in the Bible and go okay not forget that we're just all going home I mean he gave my dad a long plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him a long plan I mean he's not going to where we haven't done what God told us to do yet and God said well many people are in fear and they know one day that will happen so they want it to come so to them that's logical they don't understand a lot especially in the book of Revelation say revelations means revelations that means something you don't know so God said I'm calling you a Revelator me you know why he did that so people couldn't call me a false prophet they don't know what a Revelator is so they didn't never say nothing against it they couldn't say well she's not a terrible pastor no he can't call an evangelist she doesn't go out and win lots of millions we can't call her that huh can't call her prophet she's a Revelator don't know what that is so we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is someone who reveals like John did caught up showing the future the future no know what that was that was a bling glitch write that down and don't forget it I know Jen is writing it down right now if I say word she goes you did a bling glitch that means you blended some words together okay I won't explain it yes you've been there I'm sure people been there right you've been there well at least I'm not talking about noses putting the animals on the art tonight that's Moses and Noah doing it together when Donna even said Adam did it I did hear from people I have a bloopers thing one day and just put them all on there go there and look at it but now I forget we're talking about who is listening Revelator you're right so see I hear them all the time I have to fight when you're eight you need help so he didn't pick me to be a professor you know I was graduated middle of my class like literally middle we had six hundred graduating students we have a lot of people coming to Florida to go to school I guess they like it we're pretty laid-back there you know and so it's a nice place to live if you want to come live someplace different go good vacation time try not to come in August really hot so being a Revelator's a little bit different that usually doesn't mean profit just so you've wondered you know John was a men and it's okay I love doing that but I love being with my father my heavenly father him all the time I know why Jesus loved him so much I know why he wanted to be with him I know why he went away to the mountain to spend time with him I know how hard it was for him to leave home and come here okay he was not poor he didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor he became poor when he left heaven because heaven is certainly not poor there's nothing poor up there nothing splendor and wandering beauty you couldn't afford to build the house that you're mentioned that your mother lives in you wouldn't even have the right substances to make it the walls sing literally they sing they leave you go on tours come back they sing hello to them the trees uproot their self and they come and sit in your house and be your friend for a while they'll go back to the friendly forest is this ok it's not gonna be normal no you can't be normal you've been going to heaven for 20 years you be normal to heaven they tell funny stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped most people when they go there no matter how they were here they're all happy they love jokes they love to tell funny stories hear funny stories they love it they make plans for people before they come they knew Paul was coming they all knew Paul is coming there's a place you go in heaven where you find that out and you go in this beautiful amazing building and these supernatural monitors much better than ours but these are good and you can see who's coming home who's about to come home to heaven everybody starts getting things ready they're so excited they're there beside their self they want to make sure they're all there say all to meet you at the gate they have a huge celebration they plan one themselves heaven plans one the throne room plans one people have celebrations in the street over someone coming home stay home it's because that's where you came from we were alone to the earth for a while when you go home you are really home and you're not dead they don't throw parties for people who aren't alive they have huge celebrations lots of music lots of food everyone meeting one another visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't taking you himself sometimes he does take people he comes into his own chariot flaming horses picks you up and takes you up to heaven then when you get out you see the sea or the mass of people waiting to greet you and then Jesus walks you up the steps of the throne to give you back to the Father and then the father reaches out of that glory that moves in and out of him the Living colors of the bow coming in and out his eyes flames of fire passion for you just glowing and he reaches his arms out and grabs you he says welcome home my son welcome home my daughter you go home as his children say we are his offspring every morning gets their own mansion you don't have to share it with your brother or sister I'll have my own one day it's made exactly the way you would love it but it's made with his presence in the walls and the floors and it's not gonna be a normal shape trust me it's not all your pets to be there they'll be waiting to greet you eating your food at your table your family members will all have gifts for you for every year you've been apart they will get a gift that represents that year and put it in your mansion after your welcome home party in the throne room which could last for quite a while your family will come get you and take you to your own mansion then they'll have another celebration everybody laughs and filled with joy to see all the ones they loved before little tiny babies they never got to raise they get their children given to them to raise the same one that you that didn't make it all the way through amen God keeps them they live with your grandparents or whoever when they get there they'll go get them and help raise them for a while I love the story of a mother they lost their son he was either 7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of course they they grieved over him but knew he was in heaven and I think it was like 20 years later or 30 years later one of the other huh she died on the operating table and was caught up to heaven saw her seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom you're here this is so exciting your mom I'm so glad you're here and you cuz what have you been doing goes I've been playing with my friends what you think I've been doing he's been living with his grandfather and playing with all these friends and the streets to go they were playing and he was laughing and he said but you can't come yet because it's not your time and so she came back never forgot it and her and her husband went around the world talking about it you will be known as you are known except you look better like a whole lot better you'll have hair most guys wear their hair about down to their shoulders don't have you know that's gonna change y'all I'm just letting you know I can't change guys unless you really want like a buzz cut or something no Marine Corps or my husband may still have one I would might be surprised to see him alive yeah he's still with me by the way another way to kill me but that was okay it's all worth everything it's worth it all no matter what you surrender give up miss doing it's worth it and you'll be so happy when you stand before God and you're welcomed home knowing that you gave everything you could not saying you have to walk around poor okay that was the devil's plan not God's his plan is to bless us say bless us and prosper us it'll be worth it some people have already seen Jesus here right how many people have seen Jesus let me see either in a vision or dream or in reality if you've seen him how many people have been encountered an angel there's usually a lot there's a lot of people here it's going to happen that's part of the acceleration that's part of the more it's a lot of them more actually that we will see angels and they will probably be talking to us they came from God ignore what we've all been told our whole lives don't talk to angels they did in the Bible amen there's gonna be a lot more of that angelic not just visitation because what we're going to experience is the habitation heavens not coming for a visit a heaven is not coming for a visit they're coming for a habitation you're part of the habitation you are all of you sitting here say I'm alive and breathing I'm part of the habitation but God is about to do on this earth does not just take a territory here and there what the habitation will be is in us say in us that's the part of the habitation that's why me and won't be able to control it like they have in the past say God will be in charge it's a habitation and it will remain for a long time he's gonna transform this world right now he is shifting government so he can shape Nations it's part of the platform he's giving us in the habitation he's got platforms for us that's the place that we will operate from and speak from shake things cause things to be released to change for him it's not a lot of how it's always been in the past that's why it's a new thing say a new thing it's time for the new thing it's where we will be ruling it's one of the purposes that Christ died for us that's why he went into hell and wasted it took back the authority and Dominion the Adam had given away he gave it to us he also gave his power over all the power of the enemy say we have power over all the power of the enemy say he did not give that to the Angels that's why we need to command them they can't just go tear up any demon they see they just can't do that they do it in in the past it was from answers to prayer and prayers never going to go away it's never gonna go away he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's gonna get even more powerful especially when you command part of an army of heaven and they pull down strongholds for you and crush the plains of darkness we need this say we need it to rule in this day say every King gets the Kingdom and gets an army if we're part of the kingdom we get part of the army did you ever see a king a natural King on this earth title rule with that one they wouldn't go very far with a they'd be overrun beaten up things stolen things killed someone's like the devil he comes to kill steal and destroy that's what the army prevents heavens army was designed created and made every one of them unique and different but they are fierce they have one job the ones under Gabriel have many different jobs many different positions to do many different things but but Michael is over one specific part and that is the army they have a headquarters they have barracks they have training fields they're all in the sky of heaven Rand maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus would go send up Michael to gather the army from the far ends of heaven to fight on behalf of Israel people say Amen it's in the Bible go read it sometimes they even fought the flesh did you know that yeah some of them could fight the flesh in this time on earth it's mostly battles in the spirit battling the demonic even those in the high places the principalities and the powers the things the beings in wickedness in high places many of those high places will be shredded and pulled down say our weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds that's one of the things the army does I can only share what I have been told and I can only tell you what I have been shown shown and told that's what I talk about but they didn't just show me things and tell me things I had to live it every way something mom is trained in it was for the body of Christ so I had to live it to let you know it's real and it really does work she follow heavens protocol see on earth as it is in heaven that's what we've been asking for for generations we should have expected it jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told me is it I knew if I taught them that and said you say that eventually it would come you mean one thing I could get them to agree on no matter what denomination they rod to clear that prayer because they need us to call things in is that right you have not because you ask not if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give you anything you want no matter what it is where it is what time it is I give you permission to use me as anyone ever says something like that let me see your hands well I'll get ready because he's calling in those words yes it's gonna be amazing say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna be amazing here we can live on earth like they live in heaven which is mainly his will being done his way say his way not our way that's part of the more she's gonna do new thing he goes revelation and then ways for you to use that revelation it means a lot of things are gonna change so if you're stuck in your own mind or your own mindset of what you think is gonna happen and because it didn't it's not going to you need to just so that away because he does have a timeline in his own throne room and those dots on that timeline is when his things are going to happen regardless of what anybody on the earth is doing it's his sovereign will and what right now this time we're in it's on his timeline it is many of the generals are going home doesn't mean they'll be oblivious to what we're doing that means they'll know all about it after they get there and the thing they'll be celebrating is us who are still down here being a part of it so God really needs us right now he's intimidating me although I probably would have never chosen except when he asked me I said yes say it's important to say yes to being chosen many are called but few are chosen because they don't choose that's why many aren't chosen he can't make you do it right you're called you're being called but he can't make you do that you have to choose yes and when you do that you're saying yes I want to be chosen and then you're chosen what does it take to be chosen say choose yes then you got to be willing he makes it a little bit you know gotta be willing and obedient say willing obedience next say surrender is not control a lot of people think it is because you know God does have he does have I'm trying to think of the natural earthward it's like not there he does have guidelines is that right even Jesus had them that he operated by Jesus didn't just pick things on his own all the time where did he say I do yeah what his father said right but he showed him and what he told him that's what he did that's why we need revelation otherwise we're gonna get man's mind set on everything and that hasn't worked well has it he's not going to abandon the church I've heard all kinds of things when people's gonna abandon the church it's just gonna go away burn down we don't need it anymore let's get rid of it when he's not saying that to me he's going to set it on fire amen this is a time to be willing and obedient if you want to eat the fat of the land and Jesus did ask us to pray about one other thing pray that my people say we are his people be willing and the day of his power well obviously if he's going to give us revelation to operate like he does and part of that is power he says he'll give you power over all the part of the enemy there's one right there he's given us power and he does have power so if this is the day of his power the biggest thing the most important thing is remember the willing and obedient thing what he asked probably won't seem natural or normal to you wasn't natural normal to ask me to have pink hair I wasn't a pink haired person I liked it he wouldn't have asked me it's better than camel hair I like pink here any day over camel hair it smells it's stiff not comfortable and he had to wrap himself in it okay my pink hair is a test it divides asunder the Spirit from the flesh so those who trash or bash it or in the flash are we still so walking the flash say no we're supposed to walk in the so people don't have to tell me if they're hearing their flesh or hearing their spirit it's the way they react to the pink care now people who like pink hair they think is amazing so the world must be passing their tests because they all love it that's amazing you look amazing what do you do I'm a spokesperson for haven't I've been there and then they all say the same thing they don't say you're liar your father's property was that they go what was it like what was it like is it beautiful is it amazing is it real is is God real is there a god and go oh yes there is a God and you lived inside of him before you came here okay that makes him interested not bashing amen try that next time you did live in him you moved in and out of him he was your very existence you had your very existence in him that's why he knew you that's why he saw you before he sent you here you're wonderfully and perfectly made your souls were the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's Revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well I'm missing that no Adam became a living Saint loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to God that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life it's probably one of the least talked about things in the church it's a soul growing up I always heard that it was bad and went but God made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with God and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your souls fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody you wound and hurt eunuch stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand I was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time I never usually know but I looked at my clock and I was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it look like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause her soul to prosper all the time and then they live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that where B means lib it's called divine health so I since I learned about the father taught me about that he said people can loose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you loose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can loose from your soul and he said I know most people buying the devil but the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talked about the loosing thing what are gonna do with the loosing key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of God to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about God will never be taken from you and so people I know you know if you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it I'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue in your anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all it comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to loose that's that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of God as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming home you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're gonna do some spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll be excited you mean leaving an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're gonna have some fire sent the Angels already outside waiting but they're gonna do that tomorrow night I did this recently where I mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time just darkening I want to say drops of it the fire of God is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our God is a consuming fire I'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of Christ send the fire I want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart I mean literally make sure your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with God the fire it burns it out then he puts him in selves in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from God two stones a fire I find a one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that Satan left on some other planet that was in a Bible and I already knew what they were so God made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they were inside God or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the River of Life that's in him the river flows out of him the gemstones flow out of him even the steps of the throne room have gemstones they flow out of heaven and become the crystal see is called the crystal see because there's gemstones in it not sand that's why it's cut crystal faceted gemstones they're all over heaven they all come from one place when the father and the firewood burn inside of him and Lucifer would step in and there's his holy mountain inside God say God is not a man he doesn't look the same inside that we do but we lived there that's why we like sparkly things way back in our way back in our spirit man we remember that we met we remember that there's something that connects when we look at something that's brilliant and beautiful gemstones represent the love of God his love his revelation upon this rock I know he said Peter was a rock when God says rock in the Bible he's talking about a gemstone you know that white rock that white rock rock or stone you're gonna get when you go home to heaven and there's a name under the only he and you know it's a white diamond it's not a River Rock every syllabus I ever saw showed a river rock when it talked about that that stone so inside his eternity you never see at the end there's no end inside of him no end and we ran up and down this mountain and we slid down the river of life and would jump on the stones of fire through the flames we lived in those flames you're about to get baptized with him it's amazing I don't even know what time it is I better check what time is it oh my my see gem she's at it you didn't finish talking about Ron McClellan remember I was at his service right and I can I come in with these books in his parents and grandparents are sitting on the front row I didn't know him so but I knew a couple people there at celebration Church they let me come in and I just was going to wait till everything was over and they were everybody with their line going by the casket and he had this bright yellow suit on I mean bright with his big white tie and and he had the biggest fro I've ever seen on a human they had to stick it down in the casket and as I was walking I was walking up I looked up I was trying not to laugh out loud because it was an open portal and he was watching his service and now this is a band right band in a van travelling telling jokes non-stop doing sock puppets you know crazy stuff he did crazy things in the van with the guys and his band was there and they were telling the funniest stories and every time they say something funny he would go like this is here we go so here I'm looking at the casket and then I look up there he was alive for now and there was a lot of funny stories right so I'm like this is just this crazy it was so much fun and so I went back sat down and then it came up when I gave out the books and I didn't know who his parents were I knew who his wife was and her mom dad were there and I gave them one and I didn't know that was his father sitting there so I was telling you know his wife this is a book about heaven I really think it a bless you and I started to turn away and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take an extra one so of course willing and obedient I had an extra one in a little bag wondering who was gonna give it to and he grabbed my arm II said did you say that book was about heaven I said yes I I've been there he says can I have that book and I said yes yes you can have and he goes well I'm Randstad well was then this was for you because I didn't know you were gonna be here but he told me to bring it so this is your book and a few months later I get a phone call it's always in the middle of night and it's his parents and they're undone they were so full of joy in celebration after reading about what heaven was like they already knew what their son would be doing having a band and he does have a man and it's called the other side of the story his heaven he went from story side be to the other side of the story that was his bayum but in the band angels were playing and singing with him because he said he wouldn't let anyone take the place of his band when they came to heaven which I told their band and so his parents called they were really excited about everything and and then I they gave me their daughter's phone number he and his sister were really close together and so I called and just spoke to her for a few minutes and and then about I don't know it was probably a year later she called me she goes today is my birthday my 30th birthday and I just wanted to know does my brother even remember me does he still think about me because we had planned a big celebration on this day we didn't know he'd go home so I while she's on the phone to me God caught me up to heaven and I saw her brother standing at a portal this goes sound wild but it didn't matter he was throwing Cheetos at her from the portal and he was singing the worst rendition of happy birthday I've ever heard and this is a guy who sings sent was singing for a living right like me and this that's awful that's awful and then God sends me back and I'm she's still going on the phone I said wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to you hey I don't know what you can think about this but I got to tell you what what I just saw in heaven I saw your brother and he was throwing Cheetos over the portal at you and she starts to yell and scream she goes that that's she said he even had a throw by he run by what do you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he had her fro to so he said his greatest thing to do was run through the room and throw as many Cheetos in her fro that would stick there and she said he did it all the time and I was so irritated but now it's the most precious thing in the world that you told me that because I know he didn't forget me this is on her birthday remember and I said oh I don't know how to tell you this but he he sounded the worst I have ever heard for someone who's anointed to sing she said was it the worst happy birthday you ever heard in your life I want ya she said he did that every year too so she was so blessed to find out she that he had not changed he still remembered her he was still himself and she was so blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen I finished the story I'm done with okay so I want to encourage you to understand that your family still loves you no one has forgotten you they're making plans for you in this little vapor of time that we're in right now on this earth use it powerfully to love to forgive and to be willing and obedient understand John his last message loved one another that should be the thing we do the most amen don't forget to love if you get a choice forgive people who are bashing you when you do that it really does wound the demons and it is our time to torment the Nieman's say it's our honor and privilege to torment the demons those demons ask Jesus have you come to torment just before our time that meant that was going to be a time when they would be tormented is that right but he didn't do that he gave us power right so stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul is still enjoying his celebration party it goes on for quite a while I know that has something spent planned for him for anyone who ever wanders he made it no matter what you thought about his life or consider for him he loved God he had Christ in his heart he made mistakes he repented for them amen and he's highly honored and recognized in heaven for what he did for God and they're happy to have him home and so is his mom amen so let's make a declaration I love to make declarations say father thank you for timing my birth on the earth for right now I expect to receive the more to live in the more to be the more it is my commission I'm saying yes right now I want to be chosen help me to be willing and obedient and laugh while I do it I asked for and receive lots of fun I need fun heaven has fun on earth as it is in heaven I want to be dangerous against hell the enemy is my doormat but I am a ruler with Jesus Christ I am royalty I am your son or daughter this is the time I've been waiting for amen amen sit down do people have children here okay yeah I don't want to run too late that I don't get to lay hands on them if you have children so maybe in a few minutes I don't know what time do they pick them up okay wherever they are okay yeah I really want you given I know I'm gonna do an impartation tomorrow night I really would like to do one tonight I [Applause] think instead of talking for another 45 minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm probably getting the lightning power God last time I did it John G showed up that's who I call John G Lake he did he came and stood right next to me other seers saw him it was really zap BAM time but tonight I really want to give out a measure of the fire amen I've had a measure of baptism and fire and let me tell you I've not ever been the same so I want you to take it home with you let it burn on the inside of you don't let the fire go out what you're really doing is preparing a place for more to come say more say when I receive some of something from God I can have more I know there's major things that are about to happen in your lives shifts because this is the time to shift there's a lot of shifts the other thing is suddenly those are two different things a suddenly comes when you least expect it but just one suddenly can change your life it will fill you so full of faith when God moves his hand for you it's always a good thing say suddenly are good things because God is preparing you to receive more of him amen suddenly just send you over the edge probably about half the time suddenly czar about finances or wealth like a lot not like wow someone gave me a hundred dollars like a lot we've had quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm asking God to give you some of those also amen so when I when I heart fire to you I'm gonna add suddenly okay say I want the Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting ready for them I'm serious I really wanted God I'm a suddenly son or daughter so send it there you go now you set yourself up so I just want to get ready to lay hands on people it doesn't matter how old you are you can have a suddenly and you can also have the fiery men I see some kids running around they're gonna be fierce I'm talking about children yeah I have several grandchildren that already are fierce so I expect them to be fierce amen say fierce is a good word in this more time of God it's passionate remember the word says we take it by force so don't do don't be mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to take it by force amen in the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and encourages for us to be fierce amen and dangerous and violent say violence in the spirit realm is a good thing when we have it that word suffers does not mean that heavens being beat up by somebody however back to the translations God said go read some of the translations and see how they have translated or interpreted that verse from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take up by force and it literally said people are running into heaven and stealing things I don't know where they got that heaven is under attack no I don't believe that for a second it's us who are supposed to be violently passionate against the enemy and we had the right to take back whatever he has taken from us because he had no right to it Amen I love giving revelation in the word - it actually makes sense amen training up your child and the gift God put in them whether it's a drummer or a baker or an interior designer in the never depart from that gift because they'll be doing the thing they love the most that word in there says train up a child in the Ben or the way he made them that means who he sent you as what gift he made you and sent you here every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights and God said everybody sits on the few of the chair every Sunday trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is but one of the most important gifts he gave you is your natural gift your passion what you love what he made you to be or do in this earth that's not your job it's the thing you're the most passionate about you know your child is a drummer if they beat everything everything they have they beat on the table with it you know straw spoons forks whatever it is you buy them a farm you know the farm is set for Christmas and they pick them up and start beating on something with them the cow and the horse here they go take them in a restaurant they use the straws take them outside so they'll be quiet and then they break branches off the bush and start drumming with the bush say I think they're a drummer so raise them up as a drummer and they'll never run around the world trying to figure out who they are does that scripture make sense it's a revelation that's how important your natural gift is because when you go to heaven he plans to use it it's irrevocable you meant to be a baker make the best brownies or whatever it is you make everybody in the neighborhood loves them that everybody tells you to sell them when you go home to heaven you're going to make that and everybody will have it for free and everybody will love you they have rodeos amusement parks because people have gifts that do that is that right that's why we have fun in heaven and it's so natural they walk in heaven and here's all the stuff they need to design and to put together something that won't take forever to make it you're gonna be a baker as part of your mansion you have a full out kitchen with supernatural devices to use and all the supplies you need and then out in the front you have a bakery where everybody comes body your stuff Jesus will visit you regularly he has a sweet tooth that's why he liked honeycomb remember we served on the beach to his disciples remember he served him a meal he gave them what fish and say honey when it is cousin eat locusts and it ran in the family say I'm in the family now I know why I have a sweet tooth amen okay we're going to we're going to do this amen so I guess you can get people organized unless I tell everybody to come one row at a time and I'm gonna come down here you're gonna walk up to me I'm gonna just zap you with the fire God and then what do you want them to do next you want him to come and sit yeah Margaret stone I couldn't do this without mark or actually my team really I have a team I have like 15 people now I don't do this by myself amen every now and then I go okay I'm sending you this time you get up on the platform and speak and so I really do bless my team God gave me man using teams in this time the day the lone ranger is coming to a close amen we're going to need each other we're gonna work together amen and so I'm gonna give this microphone to somebody and then we'll come down here and lay hands on you don't forget to come tomorrow night it's gonna be amazing exciting walk sideways you'll never fall and then I'm gonna declare of declare our blessing over you when we're when we're done okay unless I should do it first because I don't know what you
