that's awesome thank you so much you know off later you know i'm a businessman actually professionally i'm a businessman but god has been calling me to set up the studio and have enter and to conduct the interviews with people like you are highly anointed you and hank so i'm sure that god will definitely help me out on this and uh thank you so much so cat last time we ended on uh the question which which is why our loved ones promote will be promoted to glory early so on the continuation of that i want to ask you another question can can can you actually talk about uh maurice's story because that that that's my favorite story and uh uh it will give hope to someone out there who lost their loved ones yes most of the things i talk about especially in the beginning of me going out and sharing it was encounters i had all the stories in my book are about encounters i had almost all of my cds dvds whatever is put out there is to bring heaven to earth and the way god did that was he would let me have encounters in heaven or things about heaven or in time and so uh what i would do after i had that encounter god would have me come back to earth write it all down he'd bring me back and i would write everything down type into my computer and date it and it would just be like that and i did that for years without doing anything in the content and then father came to me said you're going to start sharing all this truth you go back to the family members that you shared with about their loving in heaven you get them to approve of what you've written and then give their viewpoint on how they felt when they got that revelation and that's what became my books one of the most significant ones i had my mom and i had agreed to clean the home of somebody who had hosted people from out of town this person did not go to our church we went to a church of 4 000 members and we did hospitality for the church but the pastor's wife had asked a special favor that um these people had hosted people from other town for a funeral and not the funeral was not also not held at our church just to bless them she was a friend of the pastor's wife and so we did that we were there cleaning and all of a sudden the holy spirit and would talk to me and then jesus would talk to me and he said i want you to give a message to melody and i went who's melody and he said to me as clear as i'm talking to you that is marissa's mother and marissa is a young girl who just died in the ski accident and her mother is grieving very badly and so having said those words to me immediately i was in heaven i was not standing in front of the fireplace i had been dusting the mantle he'd catch me up took me into heaven and i was walking behind this young girl with strawberry blonde hair she looked like she was about 13 and beside her was this gentleman i didn't know who it was and so the lord is still talking to me all this time he said that is marissa that is her great grandfather now this always would amaze me but her great-grandfather looked like he was in his 20s and yet here's jesus the lord of glory telling me that this is marissa's great-grandfather and he's taking her to have to go have fun somewhere and then he kept talking and said she's living with her great grandfather because she's too young to have her own mansion right now and so he's watching over her making sure that she enjoys herself in heaven and then i got and the lord said hurry up and get closer behind him now these people could not see me when i'm taken to heaven nobody there sees me the angels see me father sinner holy spirit see me but the people who live there do not see me in heaven so i could hear marissa talking saying i wish i could see my mom i wish i could let my mom how much but i'm having how much i miss her when i see her again i'm going to kiss my mom on both cheeks and let her know that i am a youth leader in heaven i wish i could really let her know that and the whole time her her great-grandfather was holding her by the hand and he was smiling at her and they kept walking and walking she kept talking about other things and then pretty soon i noticed of all things they were entering now i'm still talking about being in heaven they were entering into an amusement park now this is the first time i found out that having had an amusement park and he started talking to her about going on the roller coaster and they and i could see the name even though it was in the distance i could see this massive roller coaster and it was called the rush that's what they called it was the largest roller coaster i haven't had people were riding on even angels were riding on this roller coaster and that's where he was going to take her and so at a certain point i was taken back down to the earth this is a shorter version of this whole story but i was taken back down to the earth i was standing right in front of the fireplace again and he said i want marissa's mom to know i want melody to know that i have her daughter that she's not missing her destiny that she still loves her that i have given her a position in heaven to be the youth leader over all the youth in heaven and she is she was 13 years old and so he gave me all this revelation about what her daughter was doing and other things that she had to say and then all of a sudden i he was done he was done sharing with me and so i ran and got my mom until my mom when it happened she was undone i was undone and so i called the pastor's wife who had asked us to clean this person's home i told her what happened and she said oh i have to give you melody's phone number remember that's the young girl's mother name you must let her know this she has missed her daughter so much that she can hardly bear it and she said you have to get a hold of her and share that with her so eventually i did call melody and i said the same thing i did this with everybody whenever god would catch me up i'd see families he would tell me the lord would usually tell me who their family members were on earth and sometimes even jesus would give me their phone number so i always knew these people never knew who i was they didn't know me and of course melody did not know me they didn't go to our church she was in it from a church another side of town and so i'd always say hello my name is give my name i think i have some information about your daughter well that kind of freaked her out because this was the like the weekend after the little girl's funeral like she had just buried her um so this was quite fresh to her and um so i said and she said what are you talking about and i said well your daughter marissa i believe i've seen her in heaven would you like to know about it well she didn't say anything for a minute and then all of a sudden she goes i will meet you outside the mall i can promise you that nobody would let me come to their home because they didn't know me they didn't know what i was going to say so i did meet her outside this mall on a bench and what i did was remember i said i typed all the encounter down when i had an encounter i had typed all the stuff down about what happened when i was in heaven what marisa said the places that i was shown about for her and i carried that with me so here's marissa's mom sitting on this bench with somebody who was a stranger and i lifted up the piece of paper beginning to read exactly what you heard was more detail on it i read exactly what i heard and saw and when i put the paper down she was shaking she would laugh she would cry and she looked at me and she said i don't know you i've never seen you before you didn't know my daughter but you said things only my daughter would know and she began to say the things that confirmed what i had seen she said every day since she was a little girl i'd drop her off at school she'd kiss me on both cheeks and you said that her her gown that she was wearing her tunic pants and top was blue and white blue and white were her favorite colors you said that she was going to cheer me on she was a cheerleader in her school you said that god had made her a youth leader and that was her whole goal in life she said my daughter mentored kids in her elementary school and in her middle school she loved people loved them no matter what they looked like even if they were the ones who were cast aside she loved them she had a heart for people and her whole goal was to be a youth leader and now you're telling me she is a youth leader in heaven and she said i was crying out to god just today before you call me saying god i have to know where my daughter is is she alone in heaven what has happened to her and that was the first thing you share with me that she's living with her great grandfather and i didn't know who that person was even though i'd seen them in heaven and she said so you've answered questions that my heart cried out for she said but the real reason i know you were there was about a week before her funeral took place i was in her room looking through her things now remember marissa was 13. she said i found a journal she kept when she was either six or seven years old it was an assignment from school and marissa was to write down important things that happened in her life for a certain period of time and the mother said on this one page i found this written by my daughter when she was young and marissa had written in her little girl handwriting uh last night i dreamed i died early and went to heaven early i saw my great grandfather he took me on roller coaster rides i saw tons of mansions and it was amazing but as quick as god caught me up and showed me he brought me back to earth now this was absolute evidence that this was a true encounter i had with somebody i didn't know i knew details because i had heard them say them having never met these people before it totally stunned her mother but her mother knew i was telling the truth and so that changed the whole way she felt about heaven i know she still missed marissa but it's also proof of this you will not miss your destiny when you belong to jesus christ when you're come to heaven you will step into the destiny he had prepared for you before he sent you to this earth and the mother actually told me i actually have i did still have the journal that i found that she wrote all these things down in and she said i want to show it to you and i was undone now this was another day she said come by come by my mother's house which is the one whose home i was cleaning and i was shown the page in this little school notebook uh that her little handwriting was on that page with those exact words so how would i ever know that marissa had written that and melody said you're the only person who knows about this no one knows about this happening so i know what you're saying is the truth and those are the kind of encounters god gave me for over 20 years he would catch me up and tell me things like that about people it's confirmation and it's actually proof that number one heaven is real god is real your destiny when you belong to jesus christ is sealed in him and you will live the most amazing life in heaven and so i love to share that encounter um some people who actually knew marissa knew melody over the years because it's in my book it's in book one that whole story is and melody wrote a special message in there to whoever reads the book about how that changed her life knowing that information about her daughter so that's there's amazing things in heaven but this is the proof he's given me so he didn't just give me an assignment to go go talk about heaven he's shown me those places i've been to those places and so i thank him all the time for trusting me to share truth with everybody but marissa is up there still completing her destiny she is the head of all the youth in heaven they're planning their part for the mirror supper of the lamb and it was time to start that and so i do need to add one thing when marissa was a little baby a prophetess came by their home and told her mother melody this child will not live a long life but her life will impact the entire world and of course you know that when her daughter died early that thought came to her about that prophetess letting her know that her daughter's life would impact the whole world and it still does today amen thank you so much ma'am right uh guys uh before we get into the remaining part of the questions i just want to introduce you who cat is cat is the revelator and i'm sorry i forgot about that cat is the revelator she has been to heaven thousands of times so in fact she lost she stopped counting after a thousandth time and i have been following her since 2012 she has been a great influencer over my life i i consider her as my mentor and my spiritual mother so thank you so much man so the next question would be right this question i need to ask you before i forget because i was slammed by my uh indian friends you know because last time i didn't ask you this question did god speak to anything specifically the plans that he has over our country india has he spoken anything to you specifically about india india was created to be a place of beauty to create a fabrics and beautiful things to wear it's it's supposed to be a place of peace and there is peace there understand that they have gods that aren't the one true god but his whole plan for india was to bring beauty and love into this world it's like people don't realize whole countries sometime were created by god for a specific purpose and i can use this one just as an example i know uh we're supposed to talk about india for instance germany everybody knows when you hear the word germany you usually think of hitler and all the horrible stuff that went on but god told me he created germany the country of germany was made by him to create glory for god that people would go there to feel and then be engulfed in the glory of god and i had the the opportunity to actually go and share that with them because they're still stuck with that picture that people have of them and sometimes what people think about even a whole country it's not what god desired it's not what he called them to do but i can tell you this over the next few years india will begin to change more and more people in india will be receiving jesus christ as their savior and step into the true destiny of india amen and i can tell you one of the things that will happen in india is the business the businesses it will springfield from those who believe in jesus christ and you know i haven't discussed any of this with kumar not any part of this at all india was also made to do big business i mean really that's what bring a great prosperity to the country but it will be done through those who live in the kingdom follow jesus christ he'll give them witty ideas and inventions for things not even on the earth at this time so india's future that god has planned is great and right now what he is doing all over the world is he is shifting government leaders so he can then shape that entire nation for him for god for the god who created heaven and earth the one whose son came and died for the souls of everybody and so india has a beautiful bright future i know other countries were called to do technology and other stuff like that but i can tell you india is going to bring help and beauty and happiness to this world because that's what god called them to be it was no mistake that our president who actually still is president yeah he did win the election we know it was stolen evidence is being gathered trump will be put right back as our president trump reached out to the head of europe country on purpose to see if there's anything he could do to help to protect india to help be a friend to india i don't think we have many presidents that have done that god planned that on purpose because trump is one of the ones who will be connecting with the government leaders to shift their thinking into a democracy into knowing jesus christ and so that right there is a sign to you that this is going to happen so if you don't know jesus christ you need to begin to pursue him because he will be involved all over in india very soon wow wow we receive it ma'am we receive it and i have goosebumps all over my body thank you so much when you were talking about the business and the plans of god over our country we receive it we receive it thank you so much right the next question is how can a person recognize the call of god or the gifting that which god placed in their lives and how can they operate in it well i think the number one thing is to probably discover what your gift is now there's a difference there are spiritual gifts and there are natural gifts a natural gift would be somebody like in your country who deals with the natural dyes and fabrics to create beautiful things or a jeweler who makes beautiful designs and jewelry those are natural gifts it's this these people it's their passion they love what they do and usually if it's your natural gift you're really good at it and the reason you're good at it is because god placed that in you before he sent you i'm actually a photographer i know my my commission he gave me was to take me back and forth to heaven back in time forward in time that's the commission when i get to heaven one day i won't be doing that anymore obviously what will i be doing i'll be a photographer in heaven that is my heartbeat that's what makes me gives a great joy it's a natural gift to do amazing photography i tell people i'm capturing moments in time and so that's my passion usually your gift is something you're passionate about is something you would do all the time if you could it's something that brings you joy other people joy your spiritual gifts are different most people can develop spiritual gifts it says all may prophesy as a believer people know that we all have an assignment to win the lost you know to operate in the kingdom the gospel of the kingdom we all haven't uh you know we all haven't been commissioned by god to pray to pray for our countries pray for people around us pray for people we don't even know those are commissioned spiritual commissions when you get to heaven you won't be doing any of that nobody needs to pray for people in heaven everyone's already saved the sayer everyone is healed that's there you know no one's sick in heaven so those fivefold ministry gifts like the pastor the teacher the prophet the apostle the evangelists they don't need them in heaven because everybody's already knows jesus christ so what will they be doing they all have a natural gift and whatever that natural gift is it could be an artist it could be a silenced it could be something who creates designs even in heaven or makes fun places in heaven to do that's their gift that's your natural gift the most important you discover is not your spiritual gift because that's temporary that's for now the most important thing you can do even when your child is young is discover the gift god put in them my one grandson i knew when he was two he was a drummer he was born with that gift all he wanted to do was drama on everything he is amazing now because he pursued that his parents knew that they pursued that and heaven guess what he'll do he'll be a drummer because that's the gift god put in him so i have to say realize what it is that you love to do maybe it's working with flowers or with the fabrics or jewelry maybe you like to do architectural design interior design maybe it's working with animals they have all kinds of animals in heaven so i don't know really know a lot about india about i know i know it's a beautiful place i know people love there's a lot of peace there but when god starts getting involved in your country things are going to change for you to be so much better for you so recognize what that passion is that you carry inside of you and when you get to heaven nine times out of ten that's what you'll be doing because there's so many things in heaven to do people come home maybe they're chefs maybe they're bakers they have delicious things to eat in heaven because those people when they go home they'll get a bakery they'll have some some way to produce stuff everybody gets to enjoy those things so i have to say ask god to show you if you don't know but usually it's the thing that you love to do the most inside and then there then you pursue that yes thank you so much right uh ma'am uh i heard you uh once talking to steve schultz on that uh on the interview on the studio and you were explaining about uh uh exodus 33 23 because man uh man gives the interpretation of the scripture but you don't give the interpretation you tell us what exactly god means when he put that scripture over there can you give us the clarity on uh on when god said i will show you the hindu parts to moses what did he really mean by that yes see what he gives me is revelation not man's information that way that's what you just said most people read the bible and they they take into their head as information but god says there's mysteries hidden in the word and what that means is what he actually meant by that scripture and so what he was really saying to moses he said that because he was his friend he called moses his friend he said i'll stick you i'll put you in the cleft of the rock and when i pass by i will show you my hinder parts the hinder parts that's the scripture you're talking about correct yes what he was saying is i will take you and hide you in myself and as that passes as things pass by inside of me i will show you time i will show you the parts of time that are behind me the hinder parts aren't talking about his physical body they're talking about all the time that passed behind god in other words what happened before moses was born because moses had to write the book of genesis how would he know about adam and eve how would he know about the top how would he know about all those things how would he know about noah i'll tell you why because when he took him and put him inside he saw all those things happening so when god brought him back out he was able to write that whole book of genesis because he saw the things that actually happened so when god said the hinder parts he meant the parts behind me or the time that has passed by and so that's the difference in thinking god put him in a rock so when he passed by he wouldn't die that's not what he said that's not what he said we know that jesus is the rock isn't that what it says he's the rock of our salvation so that's what that actually meant god showed him time he showed him the past so he could actually write the book of genesis yes thank you all right can you please uh talk about the armies of the heaven and their assignment here on the earth and how do we make use of the host you know the hosts have always existed i tell people angels have a history we don't have they were with god and they were operating with god before he made this world at one point there was only god's house god's house is a world called heaven it's not a building and in this massive beautiful world tribes of angels were created there was the father there was a son there was holy spirit there was melchizedek there was the living creatures and god had made this place where his throne was and then he decided to create beings who could help assist watch over heaven care for the creatures care for the beautiful things in heaven he had made so he began to make tribes of angels some tribes were different tribes this is all of them some were put under michael some were put under gabriel and even a third were put under um lucifer lucifer was over one-third of the angels he was the angel who was in charge of all worship so the worship angels were put under lucifer all of the army in heaven that god made he didn't make an army to protect heaven he was there he holds the air we breathe everything that was made he spoke into existence and the word would step out of him and make that so they didn't need to be protected why would he have an army this is even before the world was made he made this army and all they would do would they would be doing maneuvers which means practice they practice warring practice fighting they didn't even have an enemy but see god was preparing for the future so that army was put under michael who was an archangel then all the worker angels in heaven couriers career angels scribes messenger angels they were all under gabriel even our guardian angels are under gabriel our guardian angels mostly look like us they have wings sometimes they hide their wings but the army of heaven was made for one purpose that was to fight the army of darkness the wicked evil demonic means that would eventually when lucifer tried to take over heaven he was kicked out all one-third of the angels were kicked out and they decided they were going to try to take over the earth which isn't going to happen and so god designed this army to fight against them most of heaven's army look like creatures they don't look like humans some of them have weapons built into them like lightning bolts or lightning staffs some of them they fly with the wings made of light or made of energy some of them have eight eyes they're made so that they can see the enemy at all times they didn't know who the enemy was until lucifer decided he was going to take over god's throne and take over heaven at that time they knew who their enemy would become so this army got designed to fight for us that's why they were made to fight on our behalf to help defend us when god began to use them was when israel was created by god and god chose israel to represent him he was the god of israel israel was the one nation that believed in the one true god that would be the father and so they followed what his what he had laid down as laws to follow guidelines to follow they worshipped him as the one true god and when they would get in trouble when evil armies on the earth would try to attack them god would send the army of heaven himself to fight these humans that were wicked on the earth and and then they would go back to heaven that's what they do they go war then they go back to heaven some of their some of them are 100 feet high some are even higher than that the bible talks about the army of heaven several times i know that it's mentioned in particular in isaiah 13 where it talks about israel cried out they were being attacked that israel cried out to god it said god went to the far corners of heaven to the far ends of heaven and sent michael who is the captain of the army to gather the army to go and fight on behalf of israel it actually says it in the bible as proof that this is actually what they did and so i do know i've been to heaven heaven is a world so you would say maybe at the top part of heaven would be the beautiful city of god the river of life that's where the throne room is that's where all these beautiful things are but michael's headquarters i keep telling people this is at the far ends of heaven that's where they are they have a lot of activity going on sending angels down to the earth to fight on behalf of us or different countries so they're a whole different group that god designed to war and there's a scripture in the bible that says our weapons are not natural they are not physical they are spiritual they are mighty to the pulling downs of strongholds the strongholds would be of darkness guess what that weapon right there is talking about is the army of heaven that's what they were designed for but as of a certain time on the earth god had desired at one point to let the believers have part of that army on the earth be assigned to them and they then would command the army not to fight against humans but to go out and pull down all the strongholds of evil spiritual beings pull them down shred the platforms they're ruling from come against them crush their plans of darkness and push them back out of the way and so now in this time we're in that's the time that we're in we're now in the kingdom age that's what god calls it when the believers will stand up and manifest and demonstrate with their own lives the power of the god who created us who sent his son to die for us it is actually our job part of our assignment is to command the army now if you're living in sin they won't listen to you if you're being hateful to people they're not going to listen to you it says that the army of heaven hearkens unto the word of the lord that means you better be speaking life out of your mouth and not hate you better be having bringing joy and blessing to people with what you're saying because if you're not this army in other words somebody can't just say i want an army from heaven and send them to destroy their neighbor they don't like their neighbor send them over here to destroy this that isn't they're not going to listen to that they're here to pull down evil wicked plans of the devil against people it's a spiritual war it's a spiritual weapon and only those who are followers of jesus christ have the right to do that it's very significant to understand this because in the days we're in now and even the greater days of glory we will send that army ahead of us wherever we go to protect us so this army that is sent is sent to protect you your family your property places you go the area live in the city the state if i'm talking about america and if this was happening in india wherever you knew evil was going on let's say evil practices were going on and people were doing these evil practices and you had this army from heaven you would say these words i take power over all the power of the enemy in a certain city and i i come in the army of having to go and pull down the strongholds of evil that are bringing let's say thieves or murderers into the city we command the host of heaven to hold on every single demon that's empowering those people to murder empowering them to be evil shred the platforms they're operating from that pushes back the darkness that strips away the power of evil they're operating in so they will these plans will fall to the ground fear will fall upon the evil humans doing it and that's how you can impact your city whether it's thieves robbers whether it's human trafficking whatever's involved in it that army from heaven takes orders from us and i'll tell you why jesus christ said i give you he didn't say this to the angels he said it to the believers i give you power over all the power of the enemy that would be satan no matter what what for what reason he's doing it no matter what evil it is we as believers have power over all of those things going on and that's why we can send the army of heaven to deal with all the wickedness and the evil concerning those things and that changes what goes on in this physical world yes thank you so much all right this one is a kind of funny and interesting question because i grew up you know uh i grew up in where people used to uh you know say these things and what do you think about this saying don't be off so heavenly that you will be of no earthly use you write about humans saying it because god never said that yes yes i grew up like that i i used to hear people saying like that so what is your take on i heard people say in the church that you you think too much about heaven you can't help anybody on the earth it's just the opposite god actually said think on things above he's talking about heaven think about how life is there think about how heaven operates that's how we need to live our life on the earth the more you know god the more you know jesus christ the more you know holy spirit than the way you know heaven operates you yourself then have a vision of how to bring it to this earth and how you live on the earth will reflect the way they have life in heaven and so actually what they're saying is the total opposite you can never be too heavenly minded if anyone was heavily minded that would certainly include me i think about it all day long i live my life according to the way they live in heaven and it's through revelation of what the father says about it how we are to live our own lives on the earth we help people we don't harm people right we share our blessings with people we don't hoard things to ourselves we think of others more highly than ourselves we leave the love of god the life of god wherever we go we share truth which is one of the most important things this world reads not or needs right now they need truth so if you represent god if you're a believer you can't just share truth you have to live it so that scripture is totally wrong you can never be too heavenly minded that's correct thank you so much uh kat what times are we in right now uh because the bible says that these are the parallettes perilous times or the ending days as mentioned in the bible so what times we are in right now are these the perilous times the dangerous times or we are in the days of glory we are in the days of glory and this is the way the holy spirit says it to me the day of his wrath which would be the perilous times the tribulation there's going to be the days of his wealth but there's the days of his power the day of his power cannot exist in the day of his wrath the day of his power is us demonstrating who he is operating in supernatural signs and wonders above what any human could do and that's where we're in right now we're in the day of his power we're in the greater days of glory when the glory of god will cover the earth that's the power of god most people don't even know what the glory is the glory is the power in the light of god operating in us as believers and us taking not just talking about it around the earth but demonstrating his power like stopping an earthquake and making it put it back the way it was before it came uh not just walking on water but walking on air the greater works haven't even happened yet so i can tell you why this is not the parents times and the parents times people will be hoping to still be alive when night time comes they hope they'll still be alive when daytime comes they'll be living in all kinds of places not even homes there won't be homes left anymore they'll be hearty food we're not anywhere near we're probably several hundred years away from that we are now entering into greatness to be great for god to speak to the land the sea and the air as sons and daughters of god to shift things and change things in this world the wealth is going to be given to the just and the righteous that hasn't happened um we're still not doing the greater works we're not even doing the works that christ did not fully so this couldn't possibly be the perilous times it is the days of the glory of god going around this world it is the days of the manifested sons and daughters of walking on the earth those are strong believers who have great faith that will do what god asks us to do and what those things will be will be for to change things for the better not the darkness so these are not days that are going deeper and deeper into darkness i know people look around and see what's going on in the world even in our country i know what's going on in our country god himself is exposing evil everywhere not just in america he's exposing it in india in in italy all over this world el salvador i could just go on venezuela all these countries of the world god's exposing wicked people doing evil things why so he can remove them so they can be brought to justice why is he doing that so we will have freedom and liberty to operate however we need to for god with no interference with wicked governments wicked people controlling the airwaves controlling the news putting lies out so people won't know what's going on it's changing this is necessary let me tell you another reason why god has so many new inventions that he wants to put on the earth but he won't do it when evil people are trying to take over so this is a sign to me from what god is saying to me i will remove the evil people i remove the injustice and i will make the path clear and wide for the sons and daughters of god to do whatever he has them do create new things that are have never been on the earth before they will make life better for people give us sources of fuel we don't have on the earth creating new ways of transportation all kinds of new things not just here in america but all over the world that will help make the earth itself better and if god can't remove the evil he can't send the inventions so i promise you he is going to change it that's what's happening right now evidence is being gathered all over the world especially by people right here brilliant people in america uh militaries who belong and operate under the power of god and great leaders are getting ready to do something powerful and it is going to change for the good amen so guys we have the confirmation that these are not the days of doom and gloom these are the days of glory so take authority and uh start demonstrating the kingdom of god by declarations by doing the declaration how many minutes do i have man i don't want to you know take much time of yours i'm supposed to have maybe i think maybe it's what i have two minutes all right so a couple of important questions uh the other day i heard you are talking on the shows you shall so you were explaining about the scripture many have sinned and come short of the glory of god how do you respond to that can you can you explain this it's not what people think again they don't have revelation on that and people will say that all the time you know we're all sinners the bible says so that's not saying we're all sinners what that scripture is talking about is god is saying you have come short of caring the glory of god demonstrated the glory of god pursuing the glory of god the glory of god is something we create with our lives and the way we live it it produces light literally light begins to come from us because we're producing glory that glory can be very damaging to the things that hell has planned we're supposed to carry it and release it wherever we go it literally crushes the darkness it crushes the evil plans of satan and we're not doing it and believers don't pursue it they think they're just an old sinner say by grace stop saying that okay you're not an old sinner anymore if you got born again you're a new creation you've been blessed with the power of god christ gives us power over all the power of the enemy what we speak and say shifts and changes things uh it creates atmospheres around us in whole cities and what the where we come short is we're not doing it okay we're not told that or explained that in church you get saved and eventually you make it to heaven that's all they say there's so much more we're supposed to be doing so that scripture isn't saying you're all sinners okay when you're born again you're not a sinner unless you start sinning again if you sin repent for doing that jesus will restore your righteousness but we're just trying to barely survive that's the mode that everyone's been given you're supposed to be way beyond that that's where we fall short that's why he wants us to know who he is and what we've been given so we can operate in it final question ma'am uh kingdom of god suffers violence and the violence it by force please respond to this that is an awesome scripture that i was taught in person about that and uh i i didn't understand that scripture for for some time and then the holy spirit actually came to me and said i'm going to show you exactly what that scripture means but if you look in other interpretations of the bible on that scripture this is what people people interpret that scripture say people are running into heaven and attacking it now that's crazy people are going into heaven and stealing things i mean from the earth people are doing that that's how they interpret it this is the real interpretation from the time of john the baptist until now god stirs up spiritual violence and passion on the inside of the believer so they then can take things by force away from satan that's what he means when he says the violent that's that passion in you the power of god in you you take by force things that enemy had stolen from you stolen from different cities we it's our it's our uh pleasure and our honor to do that for god and so people this is how he interpreted he said that doesn't mean that people are being tortured he's not talking about people running into heaven that's not what that means it says it's when it says it suffers violence means it stirs up violence it causes this passion to rise up and the holy spirit said i'm going to give you another scripture with the word suppers in it when jesus said to his disciples suffer the little children to come unto me that means cause the little children to come into me stir up the little children to come unto me make a way for them to come into me that word suffers where it says the the kingdom of heaven suffers violence doesn't mean it's under attack it means it's stirring up in us that passionate power of god to take back from the enemy the things he stole from us yes thank you so much ma'am thank you so much kat and uh we i'm so grateful uh for this opportunity and i'm so thankful to god for this all right before you talk about your ministry and the web page uh i just want to tell you

the air we're going to be bringing you the news from heaven hallelujah i want to welcome my dear friend cat kerr hallelujah hello how are you all right praise the lord cat curious she's from florida hello so she's a few hours ahead of us but you know what there's no distance with that anointing there's no difference at all and you know i want you everyone to know that i am in full agreement and i stand in full agreement with what the lord has shown cat cure will the lord have shown her yesterday today and tomorrow i am in full agreement and i and i know because you know i've had i've been to the trips to heaven okay i don't think i think she has a guinness book a world's record his first trips you know i'm gonna just say that right now it needs to be put in the guinness book of oh i'm serious because i think over a thousand times wow i i don't know anybody like that one but the scenario of it is god has brought her in our generation in our generation and you know now i don't know if cathcart had a chance to watch us on elijah list we got a lot of response from elijah list you know and and so i'm gonna give her let her know and i give her this in about a few minutes okay the lord took me to time travel catker to the rapture generation which wasn't ours it wasn't ours the lord made that very clear to me he said this is not our generation he didn't tell me the generation it was he says i'm gonna allow you to experience what it would be like to be raptured but it's not your generation he made that so clear so clear and i was good i was okay with that so i was able to talk about it on elijah list and since i have a pastoral anointing the lord downloaded and reminded me of scriptures proving that this was not the generation so all that explained yesterday a whole lot of things got cleared up yesterday praise god you know if it's going to happen yes it's going to happen no right now no god this is harvest time saints harvest time harvest time beyond measure and cat curry tell us right now give us an update what's going on in heaven regarding our nation and globally it's yours well i can tell you that heaven has been excited for quite a while now because they understand the big picture of what's actually happening a lot of people don't know what's happening or they think it's something that it's not a lot of people think these are horrible times desperate times and you're right some people actually think this is the perilous times well i've seen some of the perilous times but let me tell you it's not now it's not for now that is a long ways away just like you said we're not in the generation even that will experience any of those things why because there's so many things that hasn't happened yet and i'm telling people there's six scriptures really that show you and i'm sure you've got them so i'm not going to quote them that god clearly explains what still has to happen and now i say the number one out of all of those scriptures that will prove it's not time to get on your rapture up and take off is the fact that it says the world will know us the body of christ but guess what our love for each other and boy that is not happening is it manuel that's right that's right that's right god's coming for for a fearless church not a fearful church saying you're right understand that alrighty there's so many genera there are so many people that have not been born yet that means and is going to experience a love of god some of them are not even here are they man well that are going to be great leaders in the body of christ for several generations so we can't end all this and we can't say certainly not going to say god is because i know he absolutely is not ending anything and he's the only one that knows when that rapture will happen doesn't he he's the only one and i can tell you we got to have the wealth transfer we got to have the greater works we're still looking for people to do the works that christ did but there's greater works even than those that have to happen the manifested sons and daughters will actually stand up and speak to the land the sea in the sky and it will obey what we say because that's god's plan when christ died he gave us authority to be over all the darkness so what's actually happening right now is god is exposing how deep how dark it is and it will explain you why there's brand new witty ideas and inventions that haven't been put on the earth and he won't allow them to be on the earth because the wicked would steal them until he wipes this whole platform clean of wickedness of corruption of defilement so all the things you hear coming from our capital that is going to be wiped clean like it never happened god will reestablish the one who actually won the election his name is donald j trump at this moment as i speak he actually is our president and guess what he knows that god has to clean this platform not just here in america this is about the world we're talking about and we know it manuel and i know it steve schultz knows that hank a lot of us know that this is not the end because the greatest days have not even come to the earth yet if you're alive now it's because he purposed you he timed your birth on the earth to not just watch time go by but be a part of the great things he wants to have happen the father wants to have happen the lord wants it the holy spirit wants it the army of heaven is just waiting ready to show up and show off and you'd be so shocked to see how many people were in that corruption i love to shake my key this is the key of time right here and i left say that because i do know i've also been taken forward i also agree with manuel when he was taken into the future that has happened many many times i've even had glimpses of the new earth he's taken me back in time and i saw heaven before he even made the earth so nobody can tell me that can't happen you're actually there he takes you there it's not a dream it's not a vision so i understand why manuel is so passionate nobody can take that away from you it literally happened and god does it to show things to us so i'm excited for men well i'm sure we'll have more encounters like that and i think other people will begin to have encounters but god is cleaning up this earth okay i know he can't take it all the way because we know that other things have to come but these days we're entering into will be so powerful this is what the father said in eternity people will sing in glorious celebration about these days we're in right now and probably the next i don't know 20 40 years more more more powerful things will happen and this earth will look different and i know people have been taking a hundred years into the future it was different but even a hundred years away the tribulation had not come yet because too many things had happened first so hang on that's all i can say hang on and rejoice because no one will stop god from having his way can they they can't do that can they man well he's going to have his way that's right that's right saints first of all you have to understand just like kat kerr was saying god loves you and and you know we all know about jeremiah the scripture which says you know his plans and thoughts for us is good that's right we've been seeing a lot of darkness but there's a pushback that's happening it is a pushback okay the uh uh we then you see the garbage on the media i caught a pack calculator i'll call them the media knights that's what they are yeah why but listen you're gonna see a push back when you read the scriptures it makes it very clear in the scriptures you know when when you see cinnabon grace abound there's a move that are happening behind the scenes that a lot of christians don't see because they yeah they glue their ears and their eyes to the media you can't do that scene is your soul i don't even watch it you probably don't watch it either do you mind i don't i don't watch the fake news i i i don't watch it because it's not food for your soul it's not for your soul says the presence of god the the the word of god which you're watching right now us this broadcast this is food for your soul yes like i told you we know we know the truth we know the truth and i said this uh also on elijah list okay prophets uh seers we get the truth before the before the the false truth we're gonna get the truth the lord said it is the truth that makes you free that's right not afford in our ministry not just our ministry in my marriage in my relationship i cannot afford to be to allow things that's going to poison my soul and it's going to take me and and and seduce my mind to to uh wavering because i do not want to be unstable in my walk with god you know uh it's not good saints now the total decision is up to you that that are watching but you have to make a decision who are you going to serve who are you going there's the world and there's the lord okay and now i'm saying this and i know kepker agrees because she's afraid as for me and my household we will serve the lord that's right the lord means you got to make decisions every day was coming into your ears was coming through your eyes was coming into your soul you got to make the food every single day god has given you and i to be the light the light of the world we are for jesus he he funnels his light through us we are the salt we flavor the world with the word of god you and i are salt thank you you've got to understand that cat carry you can interrupt me any time i know it's so exciting when you know the truth you know and you want everyone to know and to see it but you're right i know people personally who begin to watch that fake news probably back around 2016 and have fed on it continually and they're not even the same people they they can't even understand what truth is all they want all they can repeat is what is in your soul as a man thinketh in his heart that's your soul that's what you will become so what you feel in there your soul has layers what you what goes in there what you hear goes in there what you say yourself goes in there and so if all you're feeding on is the darkness the doom the gloom and the lies guess what's going to come out of you those very things and so god didn't give me a way to help people truly i don't have time to go through all of it literally you make a decision if you don't want to think that way anymore that everything's ending and there's nothing but hate and everybody hates one another and the world's coming to an end you need to say i choose my will to lose all of the lies all of the deception all the hateful words the deceiving words i listen to defilement i won't keep it in my soul in jesus name jesus will come and pull it out of you you need to be free or you won't even be able to be prepared for what god is bringing to this earth which is greatness power is carrying the glory is baptism in fire think on those things that's what's coming these are such powerful days we're living in that's what's coming and i'm seeing each one of those happening on the earth and i'm telling you you won't be the same this world won't be the same when the knowledge of the glory of god which is the power and the presence of god being carried by those who prepare to carry it we carry the glory we take it around the world that's what the scripture says the knowledge of the knowing of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea that's us taking it let me tell you the impact that begins to happen when that gets released in places it's like shock waves going through the spirit realm that crushes the darkness that removes lies it removes pain that removes all kinds of things why would we want to skip that time we're not going to all right i've signed up for whatever god wants when he wants it and the way he wants it if you can't pray anything else you need to say god i want your will your way not mine not man's because when you start talking like that freedom will be able to come to you you know we can have people come in and change things but if your soul is not free from all that darkness you've been taken in you're not really going to be free we want you to be free when you fill with celebration and joy that's what should be coming out of you right now hope life celebration joy and the power of god is what needs to be coming from us at this time on the earth saints i do receive that i receive that god has a major plan for our nation and globally yeah many of you heard us listen there's two things and i said this on elijah list yesterday on cat girl there's two major things that are standing in the way of satan's plans that is the church and the united states okay because we get the gospel out saints we get already over 90 of the gospel comes from the united states 24 7. that's right that is that is a major headache for the devil it sure is yes it's a major headache for the devil and i tell people all the time he the devil made a big mistake when he thought he could come in and take over right now but you know every time god does something great in the earth the enemy the devil always makes an attempt to stop but guess what too late too that for him he's gonna lose he's a loser he's always lost he lost in heaven he lost in hell by the son of god lost in heaven by the father guess who gets to do it now we is the body of christ we're the winners we're the overcomers and satan is the loser he's the doormat not you saints you remember deuteronomy said where are the heads not the tails hello hello where are the heads not the tails kat kur was talking about the wealth transfer earlier you know uh witty ideas and and uh dreams and visions and concepts read deuteronomy 28 read it this is where god wanted israel to be already he hasn't changed his mind okay raise us up globally as a church a strong church not a weak church not a fearful church uh not a a church with all spontaneous not a hateful church a loving church saints to love thy neighbor as thyself okay i know i've i've heard people christians i'm not talking about the world culture we've heard christians that that say things against trump let me explain something to you okay every one of us had to get born again yes every one of us already god used nebuchadnezzar god used king cyrus he as he said these are my servants all righty so we can't go on perfection we can't go on perfection whoever god says he's using he's raising up i'm i'm floyd god will work on my heart your heart and trump's heart but he fights for this season amen he's anointed and he's appointed and when god anoints and appoints somebody they are not going to fail and everyone can come against it but they will keep standing and i know someone else just looked at winston churchill in world war ii if he had not me and he was not a believer trust me maybe he made it at the end but he was very strong in his language but i'd say what else is strong against the enemy trying to attack england and crush them and guess who stood up and said no and positioned the army they had great victory because that man for that season was anointed and appointed and eisenhower was one of the same people so in our time it's donald j trump which he informed me of that in 2015 he's anointed and appointed let me tell you if you don't know that already he's not going to give up her back down because he knows that he is here to help america to achieve what god wants this is the thing he welcomes god in our nation he recognizes jesus christ as being the highest power in existence today it comes that comes from the top when that's made these other ones who are sitting where they're at they stole it they stole the the true ones who won and we all know 80 million of us know who won donald j trump in god's eyes is still our president he won he's anointed he's appointed he was the one given authority to cover our country so all these attempts that are being made right now they will fail god said they will become like dust and it will be wiped away like it never was so that's what you can look forward to write it in a book somewhere it's going to happen hallelujah you know character i'm not sure if you uh heard one of the broadcasts uh that i was on i had told steve that god took me it wasn't a time travel this was a vision and he had uh took me to a vision and i didn't see trump's face but he was on his knees he was on his knees i saw the back of him but he was on his knees things it brought to me you know i already knew that he was anointed and appointed for this seat this is his season but i never saw that part of him yeah and god showed me the back side of trump he says i want you to see this so his hands move god's hands move then it was it was kind of foggy and then it cleared up and i see this man he's on his knees the back of him i don't know what he was praying aha he was praying but i do know he was seeking jesus yeah dealing with him and i could see god's hand on donald trump so saints the bible makes it very clear we have to examine ourselves we i cannot listen to the media and let the media tell me what a man is or what a woman is i have to hear them okay you're right about that you and i know the scriptures because listen this is wonderful remember ananias god came to him in a vision and said hey i need you to anoint i need you to anoint soul he's at this place and he's praying what did anand and i say well you know what the fake news is saying lord he's out there and he's massacring everybody what the god said he is my servant i've called him that's right and he says i need you to anoint him and and you know and he's going to be filled with the holy spirit and he is go i'm going to use him to be before kings and leaders and he must know what he must go through for my name sake that was it and the minute then we read on so ananias says okay lord that's it and then i just heard from all these rumors about about what soul was doing but one moment with god that's what i'm trying to say go before god one moment with god will change destiny even in your mind yes okay and he went and the first thing he said when he knocked on the door read the scriptures he says brother soul god come to me in a vision thanks god has come to me and many of you that are listening know that god has spoken to your heart yeah what you call donald trump to do and for you to do what we what are we supposed to do back him up in prayer back him up in prayer that's what god calls us to do not judge his character not justice and to back him up in prayer we are going to see the glory of god not just in this nation but globally historically we've been chosen as a generation to see the move of god we always hear about it can't curve we hear about what happened 100 years ago in there and in the azusa streets and all the other things that took place with all the powerful men of god 100 years ago 200 years ago but now now we are part of a move of god like the red sun that we can tell our kids and our grandkids got curry interrupting when you can i don't know i know what's coming something's coming coming that hasn't come before in this time that's why the great detail in exposing the wickedness and the evil and god has said when the earth begins to shake this is what he said on november the 4th god said this on uh on steve schultz uh the chat with stevie cat go back and check out november 4th on elijah on the live streams god said that the fraud and the wickedness was so great in america but also around the world they're conspiring to take over the country to go take over the presidency and to stop what god wants done and god the father said when the ground begins to shake you have no idea the hundreds of earthquakes that have been everywhere when the ground begins to shake watch for the landslide of fraud to be exposed and he said from the highest level to the lowest it will all be exposed and justice will be given it will prevail and i will wipe it away and put the one i chose back in the presidency of america because we in this time are creating a habitation for heaven not just another revival not just another awakening we will have a habitation by god in the earth that cannot be taken by man cannot be stolen or changed or twisted that's what we're being set up right now to have is a habitation of god in us and it'll go around the world and people can't control in the past if we try to control a revival that was in a certain area this is about to go worldwide when god is waiting for that to happen but first he has to deal with the darkness and you should be excited that we're actually seeing the exposure happen right now well you can't carry you're absolutely right saints if you would go about four four or five um facebook pages and i was talking about god's gonna send an ill spirit in the white house and they're going to confusion slippery things slipping the enemy is going to slip up you're going to see people slipping up slipping up slipping and falling what what happened a few days ago that's all i'm gonna say okay why what the cat person what did she say i said listen i said if it's not anointed and it's not appointed it won't last long you've heard me say that in the youtubes you've heard me say on facebook if god has an anointing and he hasn't appointed it it's not going to last long no no i said this is this not going to last long i said so we should sit back and enjoy the show because yes enjoy the show and celebrate by eating cake because that's what the father literally said tell everybody keep praying and declaring the truth to be known and to celebrate like it's already happened and he said we're eating cake in heaven they're eating cake in heaven that's what they're doing why they're celebrating with us on the earth that no god is going to move his hand so powerfully it'll be such a shocking assembly to people some people i don't know if they'll recover i can tell you that god is going to shake things and he's going to move things where he wants them to be and people you can know you know you go write it down and see it happen because this is what god's plans are and you know it says he won't do anything without sharing his secrets with his friends the prophets come on amos come on come on amen saints the lord has been continually updating me cat kerr robin uh johnny johnny um um i i think there's a few more uh johnny jeff you know you know we were with amanda grace uh uh last week yes the lord is is ministering to this saints he didn't leave he didn't leave us hanging so we're not leaving okay all righty what does the bible tell us and and and second chronicles you know believe the word of god all right believe the word of god and you will be established believe his prop his prophets and you will proud stand on that word okay stand on that word you have to understand something this whole setting that you're seeing was happening in our nation and globally the best way i can explain this cat curve to the viewers it's like it's like a parade i live in california so every year we have the we have the new year's parade and you see it's a long parade it's a long parade and there are seats everywhere in pasadena so some people are seated in the beginning where this parade starts some people are seated in the middle where they're seeing and some people are seated at the end of the parade where everything is okay so we can't see everything but when you're in the helicopter those are like god's eyes you see the beginning to the end of the parade you see it so i could be at the beginning of the parade and i could have a friend at the end and he could tell me you know and i'm telling him you ought to see this float that's coming well he hasn't seen it yet but i've seen it because i'm at the beginning and that's how god is with his prophets yes understand that some prophecies at the beginning the middle or the end but god sees the whole picture he sees the whole parade he's on top he sees everything god is already seeing the end of this that's right you stay strong he sees the beginning to the middle to the end okay he have shown us how it ends hallelujah saints and then we on the side that wins we on the side that wins all the time so listen if i'm going to be on any side i'm going to be on the side that wins why wouldn't i lose okay all righty i'm sorry satan is a loser he he is he falls he's a fallen sheriff not a fallen god he's a cherub that's it okay he's fallen anything you do with him is going to end up in the pit hello so it's important god god we serve a risen god a god that's put in many places a goddess has a a future and a purpose for us and a god that says i am not dealt with the united states and i am not done with you and i am not done with this world and my glory is to shine my glory is going to shine saints and man society that god has chose our generation to raise up men and women of god you ought to be excited saying that god has chose many men of women of god as prophets to speak life into you to speak right already the enemy wants to speak darkness and we want god wants to speak life into you he's reviving you with the things that he has shown cat curve he's showing me that he's stone robbery he's shown john it is shown you know many of the men of god that are standing you know catcher said earlier before we got on air we know that many of you guys have been hearing from god you may not have a platform that's right but don't stretch your mouth don't be silent okay because you can get the people that we can't get to that's right be silent let the love of christ come out of you let the love of christ come out of these things all right we're supposed to inspire and encourage and even empower people by showing them how to respond to this responded this time if they don't know and right now i'm just going to pray father i just evict all fear from anyone watching father any fear any doubt father any deception that's been put in the soul god we evict it in jesus name and we impart the life of god the love of god his revelation his will his way right now in your life say i receive it in jesus name amen in jesus name lose it from your soul sayings lose that stuff from your soul send it back to the pen loose it from your soul i lose negativity for my soul i lose lies from my soul i lose deception for myself i loose it my god clean yourself out with the word of god saying amen understand that spiritual food for us glory to god i you know you know i i'm so excited about what the lord is doing i'm so excited we this is a great time to be a lie up here he says pack up your rapture rock you guys heard me say i said return return your suitcases your rapture suitcases and get your money back and get your crown on to rule and reign with jesus christ a lot of things that people have said they want to know about justice justice you know i i know the answer but i want them to hear it from you will justice be served justice will be served that is from the mouth of the father that's his revelation that's his plan and it's his will and i can tell you i've been to heaven right i've lost i stopped counting it a thousand times i was caught up on purpose i was given a commission to be a revelator to see heaven and shared on the earth that's what i've been doing since 1996 people so it's too late to tell me that god doesn't plan things and sometimes he doesn't tell people dates but if he said he's going to do it let me tell you what he is going to do and he's going to do it in a big way right now and so uh i i'm going to just stick with what god says i'm going with what he wants and i live in joy every day you choose if you choose to be happy or disillusioned or upset you know get rid of that stuff don't let this stuff be in you if you belong to jesus christ we're supposed to be just like him and i can tell you right now he's excited he's not in fear he's not trembling on his throne up there he's up there laughing at the plans of the enemy because he knows they're going to go down in jesus name and the ones who win are the ones who are with jesus christ right now and be in agreement with what he wants you may not figure it out in your head all the time but you know that's just god right he works in mysterious ways you trust him you believe him and your faith is going to grow so much in this time on the earth we're in right now and he'll set you up to be accelerated in these days that are coming sage you remember remember what kat kerr said about acceleration about the wealth transfer you know i saw a glimpse of this this is very powerful okay what god is doing god it's always god's plan for us to lead in this world and this globally people need to know about the kingdom of god they already know about the kingdom of darkness that's right they need to know about the kingdom of god what did john the baptist do he was a forerunner what do you talk about the kingdom of god is at hand when jesus came what if the kingdom of god is at hand okay and and and we have not seen many preachers the way we we should talk about more about the kingdom of god you know as as preachers and shepherds you know i'm i'm a pillar i have to leave my flock into victory not defeat not defeat you know cat kirk i'm not sure if you if you know this last year this time everybody was was in fear fear fear fear and i had so many pastors telling me close your church close your church close your church they would tell me close my church you know i had one pastor said you know if you open your church you're sending your flock to the slaughter literally i got on my face this time last year saints i got on my face i said lord i want to hear your voice i've been hearing all this garbage for the media and in my and my pastor friends i want to hear your voice he spoke to me on my face cat curry viewers and and ministers that are listening i want to say this to encourage you wasn't long just a sweet audible voice he says i never told you to close that's right i never told you to close we've never closed catch we have never closed amen remain open from day one did you think the enemy was going to sit and let some and let that happen oh no i opened the church i didn't close it in the middle of our service viewers listen to me in the middle of our service i'm preaching the gospel my beautiful wife came to me she whispered in my ears she says the authorities are outside they're outside right now and they had their sirens i gave her the mic i said honey if you if i call you you know where i'm calling from so i go out there with my associate pastor and just like my wife said three squad cars sat you know somebody called on us he looked at me he says are you having service i said yes sir he said you know that there is a virus going on i said i'm aware of that i said i have the sun's up he looked at me again he says are you gonna call you gonna stop this service i says no sir i'm gonna continue the signs are up we are aware of it but we're gonna continue this service for he pause for a second in my mind i'm thinking i don't care handcuffs can come all the handcuffs go i don't care he said okay we will never bother you again and they all laugh the holy spirit was talking to him the whole time really saying something to him and he was saying something to him right then and there that's right proved his yes and i'm only saying that to encourage you to encourage people you know we never closed we've had people that would come to us from other ministries i didn't tell them they found out that we was having service god made a promise to me catker viewers he says everyone that comes to your service will not get the virus amen in this virus he did not send this virus no he didn't blaming god he didn't send this thing okay but he made a promise to us since this thing has happened every one of our services we've had two to three services a week there have been times not all the time there have been times where we have had standing room nobody has caught anything nobody has caught anything god's word prevail so you that's why you see i'm standing here you see i'm with kat kerr on this you see i'm standing for our president you see outside country i'm sorry it's too late for me to go backwards i have seen the glory of god many times over in my ministry in my life and capturing her life and we're not backing down okay so i've seen this happen so this is i'm not so i i'm one of the ones yes i am i'm part of the army of god and pastors and ministers listen to the voice of the holy spirit listen to the voice of the holy spirit now i made a public statement i made a public statement and i'm going to say it here again i says when someone told me and god blessed them that if jesus was here today he wear a mask you know no that is not true you know i'll wear one i responded i responded to the public statement i says the day that i see the holy spirit come into our service and i see the holy spirit wearing a mask i'll put one on but uh but that has not happened and it won't ever happen you see oh yeah and then uh i'll tell you drew as i tell you yeah california is opening up right now i want to go buy and sell you know why i need food yeah in the middle i leave that facility i respect this facility they want us to wear a mask fine they want me to wear a shirt fine they want me to wear shoes fine i need to buy and sell okay once once i'm out of their airspace it's mine now yes sure it's money and i don't wear a mask because god gave us this free air i'm not telling you but i'm telling you you know many of you know that i was in the medical center for over 20 years i started when i was 19. okay we need god-given air he gave us us oxygen okay and it helps us and you make your decision from that point but i'm standing on my experience in the medical center and my experience being in the presence of god when you stand for god he will stand for you ministry go ahead catkin i would want to also encourage people even if they want to follow the basic guidelines with that i think if people want to wear them let them wear them but i think they should not make others that don't want to wear them wear them and i've heard from the medical community and they themselves have told me it is not healthy to wear that mask all the time please please if you're outside jogging don't wear your mask if you're driving in your car why are you wearing a mask you're breathing air that is not it's like dead air it actually cannot help you in any way and this medical person i had to take someone to the emergency room not for the virus something else and they're they're fine but when i was there they were just offering this volunteering this information to me and they took their mask off when they were with me and they said people need to breathe fresh air if you feel a need at different times go ahead and wear it i don't care but i would encourage you don't wear it when you're jogging if you're out in the fresh air especially if you're driving and if you're riding a bicycle it actually is not a very wise thing to do it's not even healthy to do that because you use more air and you're sucking in more air that's not healthy so like manuel i understand from a medical professional and i will also add this because the father told me he said at one time he will take the virus off the earth and it will never exist again so we this is not ever don't ever think wearing mass and social distancing is going to be your future it is not your future i'll say that from heaven it is not the future god has planned that is not going to be the new normal the new normal will be filling with the life of god speaking his word seeing miracles happen everywhere and at one time this is also from the father they will empty the body parts warehouse in this move of god that will last like for generations these generations at one point they'll empty the body of our warehouse and there'll be no sick people no handicapped people this is before jesus returns so our life those who belong to him who fall and run after him your life will get greater and better and i want to give you his word right now before we end this is what he said you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape being great for him that is his words you live by those words not what man is saying not what the enemy is saying they want to control you and crush you and push you back look forward to great days ahead and great celebration in your life amen character oh my god i receive it says come on let's say it together lord let thy word be established come on lord let thy words be established hey man do uh catch do you have that uh special cup you have i don't do demons you have that nearby this is a good way to make a statement to people and the holy spirit gave us this idea we have car magnets you put on your car we have pins you can wear that say this and the holy spirit said you're not bashing any person you're bashing hell saying i'm not agreeing with you i'm not participating with you i have nothing to do with demons okay that's what that says i don't do demons is a good statement to make to people right now everywhere they need to know you're not a part of the darkness and you're not participating wow wow you know i catch your i'm aware this and i think it's awesome um some people they want to know why that the lord uh asked you to wear pink hair uh that wasn't actually that wasn't um they didn't even ask me actually they told me thank you permission to the father to the holy spirit energies a long time ago in my life probably almost 30 some years ago well i've been born again since i was four that was over 60 years ago when i got born again age 4 i saw jesus step inside of me because i'm a seer and so that no one can tell me he's not real okay but i was given a commission in 1996 jesus walked through the wall of my heart and said the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and this is why we're going to do it they want to reveal the heaven the way it is the truth about it not what man says not what the enemy says and then five years later he walked back in my home and he said you're going to start writing books and we're going to let you have meetings to share about this but we need you to have pink highlights in your hair now i was not a pink hair person i think it looks pretty good right now but i was never the pin care person i was the wallflower i didn't want anyone to know me know about me you know i was perfectly fine i was one of 15 children so i certainly didn't need somebody's approval of my life but i never thought he would ask me that but jesus came and sat next to me and put his arm around me said we need you to have pink hair because when you start sharing about heaven they're going to realize we're a lot different than what people thought okay they don't feel like i'm judging them so i can actually talk to anyone in the world or talk to anyone anywhere this pink hair draws people when they do they're going to hear about jesus christ the father holy spirit they're gonna hear about heaven and that was their choice they chose pink hair the first time i went to heaven i realized a lot of people have colored highlights in their hair some was like emerald dust some diamond dust different colors and the father said to me i created the rainbow why would i not want you to have it in your hair wow wow so you heard his saints it's not going away hello oh this thing is not going anywhere people i've had it for a very very long time you know what that that is that that you know that for us it identifies you who uh who you are in christ and and god has called that to you and uh you know saints you know we're the bible says that we are peculiar people okay listen show me a prophet a true prophet from god that's not normal that's not you know john the baptist what was his wardrobe come on uh what was his diet local locust and honey i'm glad i don't have to eat the locust and i'm saying this i always tell people this when pastors will say i don't like the p here you have i said would you rather i show up in camel hair it's better than chemical hair any day yeah you know saints the lord says look at the heart that's what that bible says you look at the heart of the people that's right you know that's that's that's how i am i look at the heart and when i see the fruit of the spirit of god in people that's it you know you know god could send an angel and he won't look like an angel he could look like someone that you probably would not recognize that's right with that because judging folks by their appearance you can miss a huge blessing yes judging folks saints stop judging the people that god has appointed and has anointed you have to understand jesus prayed all night not one time did he go by the synagogue and pick up religious leaders he he could have got a pharisee you know now later on he got paul but look what what look what happened it turned his life around paul got the road experience and wrote the damascus experience he was turned around he counted all that he knew prior a loss think about that alrighty but in the beginning he chose uneducated fishermen he chose tax collectors he chose folks that normally you and i would judge job thanks we have to understand you can't do this just because somebody does not wear the right clothes or are our their religion or skin color or or whatever their ethnics uh believe you never know what god is doing he said love thy neighbor as thyself that's right my neighbor as thyself we can't be so quick to judge we have to look in our hearts and say lord talk to me talk to me thank god for ananias god just spoke to him and then it was over anonymize it in question in a second or third time he just said okay i'm gonna do whatever i need you want me to do and paul wrote almost two-thirds of the new testaments his epistles god no i was um i was just gonna ask something real quick paul went you know paul went from which was saul he went from persecuting and even holding the coats of the the uh apostles and other people so they could be killed right that's what he did he held him so they could be stoned he went from that to preaching the gospel to any person who would listen to kings to beggars he was releasing the anointing everywhere okay and i will tell you that i was in rome when i went to go to rome and i was near the um the coliseum i saw these great lights being a seer i saw these great lights of distance shooting up into the heavens from the ground and our our guide we had i said what is over there and they said why i said i see great beams of light shooting up like the glory of god into the heavens he said that's the prison they kept paul in paul created an open portal of heaven by the way he lived his life he honored god god left a marker that was still remains to this day is still over there where he was even in prison the light and the glory of god was shining wow saints did you get that i sure received it look look how that anointing is still get moving the presence of god and in saints uh cat curry is a seer she's a prophetess and god is used to minister the gospel god is useful to minister the gospel god has broadcaster and and raised her up in our generation and we're blessed we're blessed to have her and saying so i i highly recommend that you you follow her on youtube on facebook on her on her mystery sides this is this

a difference in this world that blesses the heart of god he does know where you are he knows your situation and i can tell you that everything is going to begin to change when god does what he's going

us we are right here we're trying the new earbuds yes i have an earbud right here let me know if y'all can hear okay she gave it to me my right hand so i thought that meant it was for my right ear but actually she has the right ear one so she actually meant the left ear but she didn't give it to me in my left hand or something i'm just winging it okay so can you guys can you guys hear give me thumbs up you know say yes we got some really i actually have real questions see here they are they're real for real questions that people have sent to us yay somebody said finally you can hear does it sound good we have earbuds on yes so hopefully it sounds me if i act like i've lost my mind okay i'm still yay they can hear so yeah it's gonna be a q a session with kat um i may i may chime in every now and then but jen's really tired today these are never going to be normal no boring professional q a sessions you know we just do it the way we can do it all right hang on a second our our mother is our audience having an issue with something she's eating she's our audience she's our studio audience right now so we don't know are you okay mom oh okay apparently her collard greens have red pepper flakes in it she can't seem to find good collard greens anywhere no you don't need to send the cinnamon thank you very much collard greens be careful we are very careful what we asked for or even talk about because i don't know what the mailman would do if they were delivering you know five pounds of greens every day for two weeks in a row they might inspect us it is our it is our mama's birthday tomorrow she will be 90 9-0 the big 9-0 let me tell you and we're going to have a couple things for her but you feel like you still want to send her something you can send her a picture of a flower or draw her one or some bird she loves birds and flowers i think that's her her big thing she loves being outside she loves waterfalls fountains and so so someone's saying cat's earbud is low my earbud is low do you have it you mean it's sticking down long or does that mean you've got burned down though i don't is it not supposed to be pointing down because i don't understand i can hear now whatever that means i couldn't hear anything before it was like i had something stuck in my head oh my gosh you guys are you you are witnessing what i have to live with every day it was like something was stuck in my ear and then take it out i hadn't told you i had to get a miracle [Music] oh it's gone wait it's got that i got something stuck on my ear thing again okay what did you do to your earbuds i just took it out of my ear oh take it out again do you want to switch here can you guys hear her talk cat can you hear me because maybe this is pointing in the mind maybe it's in the wrong ear i don't know see it's right there in my ear yeah this is going to play all over the world you know that right because okay so just make sure you you guys have your devices turned up all the way yeah because some of y'all are saying you could hear fine some of you are saying cat's too low so i don't know i've never been told i [Music] okay okay all right so you're going to read the first you want me to read it are you going to read it well you know it's one that we actually talked kind of about not y'all just us talked about it and this palm even asked many times um and many different places but somebody wants to know i'm just given first name so if you have a question we're saying your first name you won't say your last name so this question is from john and john wants to know why i can hear again it's another miracle from heaven i took the earbud out okay we are now escorting the red pepper flaked greens out of the studio so now we have no audience except the studio cat and he's ignoring me john has a question he wanted to know why [Music] sometimes people charge to have an event you know i never charge i never have charged not in all the years we've been doing this so people who say you know they don't help or don't give they're i do like every day i help somebody but we don't charge because god said we couldn't hello if you said you're not charging for your events now we can sell products if we have products even take up a free will offering but as far as in order to come uh places invited me it's the people who were creating and hosting the event needed to charge something for very good reasons having done this for many years and i have events myself our events that we have here in florida cost anywhere between 12 and 25 000 every time we have one we have to pay for the event place we have to have materials printed we have to have camera people sound people we have to have people who help do different things uh maybe get all the people car park whatever you want to call it and if we provide snacks or stuff that means we're feeding our staff if we have an all-day event that means we have provided them with food for like lunch and dinner and we have other things we have to do if we do a photo a workshop or a prophetic art workshop we are buying materials i'm just giving you an idea of why sometimes people we don't we pay for this all out of our pocket as a blessing to help you but but there are fees we have if we have another speaker we pay that speaker so we have all kinds of fees that have we have to pay ourselves some people can't afford to do that such as the awesome event they just had in oregon the rise summit which was not a conference trust me it was a big difference they went 11 hours a day just so you understand this it would probably cost between 30 and 40 000 to do this event that they had in oregon and let me tell you what that's not real easy money just to come up with they decided to charge a fee not only did they pay people who worked the conference because they got professionals to do it you can sometimes use volunteers in some positions but there's some positions you can't do that with the camera people the sound people the lighting okay they have security or they're still in partial kind of shutdown up there and of course if you're going to broadcast to the entire world that's called a bandwidth i know a little bit about that stuff not so much about the wi-fi whatever but i do know that if you're going to have a broader band of people or how many people are coming on to watch it online they pay for that no one right now has a network like the fake news cnn or the other fake news places that have huge studios and huge networks with satellites and everything they pay a whole lot more for their stuff but most places don't have that they have to they have to run special cameras sometimes or they have to at least pay for a broader bandwidth so that they can't go to just a thousand people but if they add people like two thousand three thousand four thousand five thousand they have to expand whatever how they all do this frequency use of the satellites whatever it costs money when you keep adding people who are going to come online to watch or it will crash i know that because we've been in many events where it crashed so if you're going to do it with excellence and you have to pay out these people to be there they have to be there all day because these things literally lasted from morning till evening they had 10 and 20 minutes segments then they'd have someone speak they would have the most amazing worship if you were one of those people who paid a price to watch all of these uh events that took place i mean the people speaking and sharing very powerful key people on this day they wanted you to have the word of the lord about everything i just lost my little piece excuse me see it's right there these cost money too by the way i didn't pay for it but i think margaret did it's back in there i hope that i hope you're not being bored by me because i'm gonna be kind of serious right now if people are gonna do something in excellence the rise summit was not about somebody saying this is our church we're gonna have this event and charge people money so we can stick it all in our pockets that is not what happened they had so many speakers that were a part of this okay and they got paid they earned it says pay you know pay what is due to someone who's whatever that goes give honor to whom his honors do and so they honored everybody everybody got paid to come in person or to even share online why they took their own time to do that for everybody and some of these things that will change your life forever but for 11 hours a day for these two days plus on sunday they let me speak even longer that was a huge event i saw so many people in this place serving some were serving but a lot of them were actually people they hired to do it right and that is why they had to charge a fee no one complained about the fee for 69 i do know this you could watch all of all of the events all of the speakers who were on there all day both days i think you also got sunday included for free but you got to keep all of the content for three years and watch as many times as you wanted to most places that charge a fee you watch it for that event and then it's none but they wanted to make a special they also had people there that was they were directed to minister directly to all the people online so they didn't miss getting impartations or pray prayed for they even had people in different rooms doing that so this was really one of the best events i've seen as far as excellence being done which god requires us to do it in excellence and they were ministering to the whole world they actually had 45 different nations watching or present i think they had 20 nations present and they had all the rest of them watching online and they were really happy that they could have two thousand people sign up online it ended up by being six thousand because they're hungry to know the truth right now what is happening right now what is god going to do in the near future i know it was called a reformation god's reforming our country and bringing people in who think like he thinks i'm not dissing everyone else but if you're not on god's timeline you'll be reporting things that may be happening 200 years from now or things how they happened in the past when god's doing a new thing you need to know what that is so this was a great uh event i was really pleased to be a part of that and also what they did on the side besides that was those who came who traveled to come were able to have many teaching videos made that we could then later use to train you in different revelations so let me tell you everybody worked hard the whole entire time and i applauded them and thanked them all those who served even those who were just hired they did a great job so so you understand that's why sometimes there is a fee because people don't have maybe they had a higher outside sound more sound system stuff brought in more people to just work in the sanctuary their south to make sure everybody got seated and or they were serving the leaders in the other rooms it was powerful and so that's why people sometimes have to charge a fee and sometimes they don't even have a big staff so they do have to hire outside people to work but you know it's always going to be worth it you are investing in your life in your future to get revelation that we need right now so that's the answer to john that's why they had to charge because all this excess um fees and costs that they had to pay out to make it great and i can tell you everybody was undone and overwhelmed by the presence of the living god angels were there i'm telling you i saw the angels that poured into that place especially during the worship so if they have one in your area they're planning to do the next one i think is going to be in nashville i think it might be towards the end of this month i think that they're going to have another rise risc summit you can go to johnny enlo's website and find out about it but let me tell you these are people with integrity who've known god a long time who speak for him and so therefore it's okay if you have to pay a fee trust me it will come back to you many times over so jen's stand stay and wind it up okay i have another question right here from eddie eddie in oh it doesn't say oh yes eddie in new york city wow new york city i don't know if you all know that but i actually was born in new york in upstate new york i actually have a say i have a part of a realm there because when you come from heaven to earth where you're born in that part of the earth you have some uh you have access to authority because you were sent there from heaven and that's where you were born i've always wanted to go to new york city and speak i have not been invited to new york city to speak but i know it's going to be coming and god loves new york city it is a major port number one it is the main port that let people come in from all over the world they wanted freedom and liberty and they came they came by the tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of people have come to that port to make their new home here in america and right now they might want to pack their bags and leave but i'm sure they'll be coming back soon you know what i'm talking about but one of these questions that eddie is asking is that they were concerned that people several people started having dreams or visions of a tsunami hitting new york and so they were concerned that it was going to be wiped out and done away with and so now they have a little bit of fear in their life because of that i can assure you there will be no tsunami hitting new york how do i know well number one i'm from there and god has said over and over again he would establish a place for me to speak there and a place to even have a a place there like a branch of our company would be there and he hasn't changed his mind sometimes dreams can be just that a dream sometimes he might send it so you can pray and take authority over the situation that the dream was about but i can assure you it's not going to be wiped off the map and neither is california god's going to take california for his own it's going to be a whole region of light as is new york city and you would think by looking at these places is so wicked so evil so much junk going on don't you understand that's the enemy so insistent on taking it away from god the enemy knows several places that god has marked on his own timeline he will use in powerful ways and i know new york city will be known in a different way very soon in the future but he's not going to wipe it out with a tsunami so chalk that up to maybe too much pizza i don't know but i will just tell you this no tsunami's going to wipe out new york city and so i hope that helps you eddie to be more at peace about that besides the fact that if you were a weather warrior you know how to take authority over that thank you all you weather warriors you remember that that just happened right uh all the earthquakes that were going on and um where was that jen the earthquakes was new zealand off the coast of new zealand is that where that happened and and they were they were expecting a tsunami to hit all the way from the hawaiian islands all the way back into new zealand and do great destructive uh measures with a tsunami which we all took authority over and said it couldn't come sent the host to prevent that from happening and they were so shocked that it never happened and the one earthquake was at 8.0 there was three in a row in the same area and normally that is how a tsunami happens it starts under the water that force picks up with the force coming out of the earth it pushes the water and it builds and builds a bill sometimes it can be 75 100 feet high the wave hits when it hits the country it never came because we said no to it so i can just tell you eddie there's lots of people in new york and all over the already know how to take authority but god himself has plans for new york and especially new york city because of it opening its arms god doesn't forget the great things that were done in areas okay so great things happen there and he has plans for new york city and so i do have another question right here this is an interesting one and this is from somebody in middle lothian virginia they didn't put their name down so i'm going to just say their question was how did adam and eve make it to heaven before jesus came down to earth to die on the cross for our sins how could they get to heaven well number one when adam and eve passed away nobody was going to heaven at that time the only ones who were in heaven besides the angels and the army of heaven was elijah and enoch elijah and enoch were taken up to heaven both in their physical bodies so adam eve when they passed away they were taken to abraham's bosom that's what or paradise it's down in the earth it's a beautiful amazing place that god made and there they were sent there instead of to hell because they believed in god himself as a great creator the one that they worshipped and because that says in the bible they were counted as righteous they were sent to abraham's bosom lived a beautiful life there and actually when christ came and died for our sins it said he led captivity captive which means when his spiritual body left the cross it didn't go straight to heaven that would not be scriptural he did descend in abraham's bosom because he had told the thief that day when the seed was on the cross and christ looked at him and said that he the thief said remember me and christ said today not tomorrow but today you will be with me in paradise that's abraham's bosom so christ descended off of the cross went down in abraham's bosom was there he got to see abraham isaac jacob he got to see joseph he got to see solomon he got to see adam and eve who were down there also even the one who raised him joseph who raised him he was down in abraham's bosom he also got to see the thief so because of that because of god holding them in a place where he counted on them righteous christ preached the gospel to them and then later when he was done and the third day in hell which we'll probably talk about at the end of this broadcast they were all allowed to go into heaven so they didn't have to go to heaven way back in the day they were held by god in this beautiful place it had running water it had beautiful buildings it had tables with feasts on them that's where those went that he counted righteous so i hope that answers your question i have another question here if i can find it i think jen had a question did you have a question jen she's playing with the studio cat right now we do have a studio cat in case you ever wondered they're not talking about me they're talking about a real cat okay so i think she's gonna go get her question i know some people are still wondering and asking what about anything new that's going on i will be answering that tomorrow not tomorrow okay tomorrow is my mom's birthday we will still have the q and a session on wednesday this wednesday 2 p.m eastern standard time uh a chat with stephen cat that would be steve schultz who will be having our broadcast and at that time we will be answering some new things that have come up about the government about the elections and about what's going to be happening real soon i hope you've all been watching johnny inlaw or hank cunaman and several others who are still talking about the things that god is doing right now and they're all saying the same thing that's the most none of them stepped back and said god changed his mind or abandoned america that is not what happened so i'll let jenna ask a question i know she's got one probably somebody sent in or made a comment on don't stop sending your comments okay that are questions we we will record them and then jen can say something so what do you have to say jen so um somebody commented on the uh the post that you did last night with the calendar for yes yes i said i don't know if you guys saw that or not but it's uh it's a post that we did for uh resurrection sunday resurrection sunday and so i'm gonna hand this to you yes okay so they wanted to know if those were the actual angels that are outside the tomb of christ ask him if they can see this hang on jen's looking at it yeah you can see it you can see that okay you see the two angels and then they wanted to know if one was funny and one was serious okay um these are the actual angels i don't know if you all know that but a couple years ago i did an event that was an on land event it wasn't cruz and steve schultz um flew me over there with the rest of their team and they did an event that lasted almost two weeks in israel they pushed back me i think my husband knew he went with me but i didn't realize we were going to go to places for eight hours like really walk like up hills up mountains down inside you know underground like half a mile and that was quite a thing for me to do that but when we went to the tomb these two angels that were there that's why we have a picture of a minute this is our 2021 calendar that i showed you this was april again here it is this is april and yes of course if god's going to send two angels on assignment together he'll always send one with a sense of humor and one that is so serious you know they're all about holiness and righteousness and then they send a character with him who's very funny you know just to break it up i guess but these two angels were not just chosen to guard the tomb and yes they're still there that's why we put them in the calendar but they also were chosen to be in that they were chosen to be in the tomb of christ they were also chosen to be the same two angels who brought the cup in the garden remember before christ was crucified he had to drink that cup that had every evil wicked thing every sin that could ever be done that he was going to put in his body and that would be crucified on the cross the same two angels were the ones that brought that cup they were the same two angels in the garden with him that were comforting him when he was struggling about what to do and then he says to the father not my will but your will be done he actually surrendered everything in the garden before he went to the cross it was actually harder to do that in the garden and so the same two angels were rewarded for doing that for bringing the cup from heaven that was filled with all that stuff so christ could then have to accept to drink it and he did and that's how our sins are forgiven it's the only reason why he is the only way to heaven christ bore all of our sins on the cross abolish the iniquities that were against us so when you receive christ as your savior he wipes all of that sin out of you which gives you entrance not just to heaven but to be in eternity with them forever and ever so these two angels are representations are the ones i saw i hope you enjoyed that story and you all know that christ did did more dying on the cross was for our sins ascending into hell like it says in the book of colossians and wiping up hell of ruining the very features of the principalities and powers there releasing fire from himself and burning some of their features and melting their faces and as a little girl i used to see these big demons walking around not my home but walking around and their faces look like melted wax and i used to think as a little girl i wonder what they did well i found out later when i was actually taken back in time and actually was in hell and saw what christ did when he spoiled principalities and powers stripped all the gemstones off of satan that when god made him he put them on him say jesus took them off of him and then the last thing jesus did before he ascended up into the tomb to get his body back he took the keys of hell death and the grave away from satan who no longer has them and that gives christ access to some very special things for us and so i would have given that story yesterday but we had so much going on we really didn't have a lot of time and for those who want to know what was going on my one brother not rj but my one brother decided to to go ahead and transition my one brother moved to heaven the other day so we've been very busy planning things for his celebration here we're celebrating with him in heaven i have no grief when somebody moves to heaven not even a family member i've been there too many times and it was it was absolutely amazing that he he didn't want to go for some time so didn't and so finally his mansion was done got it told me on monday his mansion was almost done but not quite and so it was on i think friday night or saturday afternoon i think it was when he finally moved to heaven and we we're have so much joy in our lives but you know trying to make if you've never had to make arrangements for memorial services or other things it is very time consuming and because we have over 100 family members we had to get a hold of everybody all of our friends his friends and of course his wife linda her family and her friends it is a huge undertaking let me tell you we're going to have a celebration party for him here on earth almost maybe like they do in heaven and we are so happy you don't have to send me your condolences you know don't have to help me with the sorrow i'm feeling there is no sorrow and he's not resting and he is not resting in peace he's very active right now is still in his throne room party and we know for sure that he will be visiting christmas town he loves christmas favorite time of the year he always admired nicholas who gave gifts to children and i want you to know my brother that particular brother spent most of his life feeding the poor helping people with homes giving stuff away to them he loved to create toys for children and so he really has given his whole life and now his season was up on the earth and he has now uh moved to heaven where he is now really celebrating his life doing amazing things he still loves to do his life will only get better and better so you can celebrate with us eat another extra piece of cake maybe for him i know he's probably having donuts at the donut shop with our dad and probably with jesus because jesus loves sweets so thank you for listening to us tonight it hasn't been a really long uh q a but we didn't want to not do something for you it is our heart to do as much as we can every week for you we know many of you don't have a church definitely check out some places online i know that have powerful meanings there's a gateway on mount zion in colorado and then hank and brenda there's lord of hosts uh go to lordofhost.com hank and brenda kuhneman who you've seen on flashpoint and i've been to his place already um of course

God's Timeline Part 1

or https://youtu.be/nI59VT1FO0w
hello body of Christ this is Revelator cat kerbs and I have a powerful message for you from the Father it's called God's timeline I want you to know that in the throne room of God embedded in the floor of the throne room is a timeline that is the only thing that resembles time in heaven you live an eternity there there's no watches no calendars no clocks but God from the beginning of time had things he planned to do on this earth and when that happened that fullness of time would come well I want you to know that a fullness of time has come and you're living in a spiritual time on this earth that never existed before and will never exist again God calls it that heaven invasion the days of greater glory Joel 2 whatever you want to call it God has a purpose for us on this earth he said that we as the believers I'm the search we'll do some of the greatest things amidst miracles supernatural signs and wonders on this earth that have never been done before and the reason he wants to do that is to erase the great area on this earth that exists that says there is no body now I did promise you that I would share what happened on election day so many people who stood for a platform of life and light thought that we lost well I want you to know that what made the difference was your prayers and your declarations months leading up to those days people had already been praying on their face for God's will to be done and the father said for the first time since he made this earth millions of believers laid down their differences of denominations of opinions and came together an agreement for his will to be done on this earth now I can certainly tell you that God never likes it when someone who's in power wants death the death of children the death of your rights God doesn't have a government of control in heaven government of freedom and liberty in heaven for us to rejoice him and be with him and and be able to worship in freedom and so God much you know that he has selected this time I know through some of the greatest things he's ever done he said in the spirit realm on election day if you could only see the babble that took place in the spirit realm your prayers produce power the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman availeth much power and if you could have seen what happened to the forces of darkness on Election Day because of our prayer of agreement God's already got everything he needs to turn the the whole tide of this country and burning it back to righteousness but he he needs you to continue to declare you will be done don't stop saying it you have to believe that that's gonna happen but God needs us to stand together and he said that it's time for Sustainable believers and live our life the way that they can see the glory of God in our lives we're gonna push back darkness and the days of had he said that it will be so different to live in this planet for a quite a while on this earth that because the Gloria will be so great that evil would even flee host cities sin won't be able to remain their crime won't even better remain them he said that it'll get so the line will be drawn so clearly that the enemy will have to build cities of darkness for people to go sin in and the cities that hold the glory of God and these days coming in their people will drive their dead and those citizens because of the glory on God's people that be raised from the dead I can tell you that he took me forward in time and showed me some of the many things that begin to happen when we begin to really manifest his power in his presence if you have any darkness in your life I would encourage you to get it out of you loose it from your soul because you can't stand up and try to do things for God if you have part of the enemy in you he will come and tear you up his plan for you is to kill steal and destroy your destiny he doesn't wait to do anything for God but I can tell you why the attack has been so vicious over the last few years as hell is terrified that we are about to find out who we are made in the image of God I can tell you there is no darkness and have no sin in heaven no fear in heaven there's power there's glory there's righteousness there's a life in heaven and he's about to pour that and his people on this earth you need to not be living in fear you're not hearing god you're not using the right message if you think these are the perilous times the word says perilous times will come but they are not here yet God said the world would know us by our love for each other and they certainly don't do that do they well God's about to change that it says the right the wealth of the wicked is later for the just in the righteous that hasn't happened yet either and if everything burns and ends now there's no economy then how are you gonna use this money he's about to transfer to us I can tell you what he's about to take believers and make them entrepreneurs you just stand in agreement that God's gonna use you get your life ready let him process you any way that he needs to get filled with the light of God with the Word of God get filled with the love of God he's about to baptize us with fire and the Scriptures word says in the last days I will pour out my spirit on all flesh that has not happened yet he's about to touch every living human being with the fire of his passion and let me tell you what there will be a reaction and when it comes it's either gonna expose everything in you or you're gonna care yet if I were you I would carry it for his glory but don't say that we have had a defeat I know that the forces of Hell are being unleashed to try to bring fear into this world and fear into your life and make it look like nothing is gonna happen yeah duh no God he is your father he may need you for a purpose on this earth you don't even know about one one ounce of his breath can do to this world he knows who your enemies are he knows what hell is playing for you and he's about to break the back of the enemy and his foot and you put some ugly stomping on the devil's head you begin to rejoice in the matter where you are right now if you're our believer if you stand and receive the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ the only way to heaven you need to begin to declare in your life what you want to do for him don't even ask you for something unless it's him you didn't have a passion and a hunger for him like you never have before ignore the words of those who criticize you who laugh at you let me tell you pretty soon they're gonna be running to you for help you need to know that he chose you he doesn't he doesn't choose those who are qualified he qualifies the chosen if you remember the body of Christ he wants to use you so lay down your differences stop getting offended stop getting in anger stop worrying against blessed we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces and you have powerful spiritual weapons on the inside of you you need to know that your birth was not a mistake no matter what you've been through up until this point in your life God is about to do something for you you need to rejoice and worship Him because he's worthy to be praised people can call me all kinds of names they want to I am NOT a false prophet they preach any other gospel than the blood of Jesus Christ and I can take theirs one way there it's his blood if you've received it because of his blood you have power and authority in this earth to rule and reign God said he would have put Genesis going to allow a time on this earth little rule and reign to the power of Jesus Christ you find out who you are and know that the enemy has been pursuing you to destroy you there's only one person who can make a difference and that is Jesus Christ and he came for a purpose he came to die for you that you might have a life not to see you can make it through we get to do amazing powerful things that he showed me like stop earthquakes and make them put it back the way it was before it started stop the tsunamis go and speak to the fault lines and tell them it cannot move go to punch famine lands and speak to the grindin Sea Life spring forth that's the power of God that this earth is about to see don't you want to rock this world for him so lay down your differences and begin to make a difference and understand that the word talks about these days of greater glory when this world will know that now the glory of God will cover this earth we didn't get to do that for him but you can't gossip and backbiting judge and criticize and think God's going to fill you with his power you can't run after the things of the enemy and take darkness inside of you I think God's gonna let you stand and use his power you have to be standing on a platform of righteousness let your life count there's years left on this earth I can tell you on God's timeline for planet Earth mankind not the earth but mankind has a 6,000 year lease I'm playing at earth if you will go and look at the Jewish calendar you will find out that it is the year of five thousand seven hundred and seventy three that shows a long time left on this earth and that's a good thing because we have to make a difference for him we have to lose the kingdom of God and then rule and reign in that kingdom before the millennial reign never gets here before the tribulation gets here before the perilous times get here we get to do that for him you need to read the Word of God and find out what it says grace was given to you so you could have your sins wiped out grace wasn't given to you so you could live a life of sin and you're gonna read the book of Romans see what it says about sinning see what it says about darkness in you we're suppose we filled with the light of God your spiritual body inside of your physical body is made out of light we're supposed to shed that light in this world so the world will see him and want him you have an understanding of the spirit realm around you that your eyes cannot see the word says everything that you see was made by that which was unseen and let me give you a clue the spirit realm does not belong to the enemy and it does not belong to the New Age movement it was here before they were here it was here before this world was made it's what heaven is made out of heaven is a spiritual world beyond the known universe filled with the light and glory of God where no sin can enter in he's coming for a glorious church without spot that sin without wrinkle that you're flushing your attitudes and your opinions showing up if you think we're at that place then maybe he's coming right now cuz let me tell you his soon is not our soon a thousand years to him is nothing and I can tell you at the end of that six thousand years that's Christ time for him to rule and reign on this earth but right now it's our time what do you have to do right now get the darkness out of you as an active you will loose that darkness from your soul and ask God to fill your soul be the light of God fill it with the word of God sit in soap and anointed worship music and just begin to adore him you'll feel his presence I promise you he wants you more than you want him but you have been calling for a holy time on this earth and I know that it's an important thing to have the grace of God but why trample on his blood I would wear the Kiryat on the inside of me and shake hell and stand here and say there's no darkness in me and by the right now I speak against the darkness trying to consume your body trying to consume our government father in Jesus name I declare you will she'll be done on this earth as it is in heaven and right now I say darkness your food from God's people but let's you know open their eyes right now just reach out receive it brother open their eyes let them see the EM scene let them open their ears here you speak to them so they'll know who they are we are the monarchy of the heaven you're considered royalty you are kings and priests unto your God Kings don't grovel they rule where God placed them get ready to rule in this world and make a difference like the body of Christ never has before which side of the line are you gonna step on beyond those living in fear and rule running to hide in the hills are you gonna stand with the glory of God and get ready to make a difference in this world we have a long season left on this earth and let me give you a clue at the end of the six thousand years that's when the tribulation takes place because at the end of the tribulation Jesus sits on the throne in Jerusalem and let me tell you you better be standing with Jerusalem God still calls him his chosen people there are signs of the Jewish race all over in heaven God honors them highly and let me tell you this and the country by way of God said they try to raise their ugly head hey we'll take it off

YOU ARE A BLESSING. AND SHE HAS GOT PINK HAIR. JANE:AND I KNOW THAT WOULD BE A REASON, AND WE CAN GET IT OUT OF THE WHERE AND SHARE THE BACKGROUND. GUEST: AND YOU COULD NOT MAKE IT UP AND NUMBER 1, AND THE LORD WANTED ME TO DO THIS AND PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED AND THEY WILL SAY, AND GOD HAS USED DONKEYS TO SPEAK FOR HIM, AND HE USES PEOPLE TO SPEAK FOR HIM, AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO LET ME TELL YOU AND PEOPLE SAY GOD WON'T DO THAT, BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE THIS THAT CAMEL'S HAIR. I REMEMBER THE MAN AND HE WORE CAMEL HAIR AND THAT BROUGHT ATTENTION, AND THAT WAS NOT NORMAL AND THIS IS SMELLY AND ITCHY. AND SO PINK CARE WOULD BE BETTER. AND SO, THE LORD SAYS, THIS IS NECESSARY AND THE WORLD IS DRAWN TO THIS PINK CARE, AND I SHARE ABOUT GOD AND HEAVEN AND THE PEOPLE ARE CAPTIVATED AND THEY CANNOT BELIEVE IT THAT I KNOW GOD WITH PINK CARE BUT WHAT THIS DOES, I AM NOT JUDGING THEM AND THEY KNOW AND HIM AND WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE I AM NOT JUDGING THEM, AND I'M NOT JUDGING THEM AT ALL. I SPEAK TO THEM LIKE THEY KNOW JESUS AND THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO, I WAS NOT THIS TYPE OF PERSON. I WAS IN THE BUSINESS WORLD FOR MANY YEARS, AND I WOULD SAY, AND WHEN JESUS COMES INTO PERSON AND HE WANTS TO KNOW, I WAS THIS WAY GROWING UP AND HE CAME THROUGH THE WALL MY HOME, AND HE SAT ON MY LOVE SEAT, AND I LOVE THAT HE PICKED THAT SEAT, AND HE WANTED ME TO WRITE BOOKS AND GO AROUND THE WORLD. AND HE SAID, YOU CAN HAVE PINK HIGHLIGHTS, AND IN MY MIND, I WAS THINKING, BUT WHAT? AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS, AND GOD READ ME AND GOD KNOWS MY THOUGHTS, AND GOD TOLD ME THIS WAS NECESSARY AND SO HE SAYS THIS, I DID NOT CARE WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE SAID, AND WHEN THE WORLD SEES, AND THAT YOU GOT PINK CARE AND YOU HAVE, THE LORD, AND YOU ARE FILLED WITH ME AND YOU SPEAK ABOUT ME AND LOVE AND HE SAYS, THEY WILL LISTEN TO YOU AND HE WAS RIGHT AND I'VE GOT MEETINGS EVERYWHERE I GO IN THE RESTAURANTS OR THE GROCERY STORES, AND AT THE GAS STATION AND PEOPLE COMMENT ABOUT MY HAIR AND I SAY, I AM A MINISTER AND I TALK ABOUT HEAVEN, AND THEY, AND THEY COULD BE SHOCKED RIGHT THERE AND MAYBE THEY ARE CERTAIN DENOMINATIONS, AND MAYBE THEY DON'T THINK I WOULD BELONG TO JESUS, BUT JESUS HAS MADE THE RAINBOW AND THIS IS HIS, AND THE COLORS AND EVERYTHING, AND THAT ARE ANIMALS THAT CAN CHANGE COLOR, AND THIS WOULD BE HIS HOME, AND IT REALLY IS AND HE WANTED ME TO DO THIS AND I DID OBEY AND IT WOULD BE THAT SIMPLE, AND MY LIFE IS NOT BEEN THE SAME. I HAVE BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE TO THE LORD WITH MY PINK CARE SINCE 2006 THEN ALL MY YEARS PRIOR, I HAVE KNOWN JESUS SINCE I WAS 4 AND I'M 64 NOW, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SO LONG. I NEVER HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIS LIKE THIS DOES AND MAYBE YOU COULD GO FOR THIS IF YOU ARE OVER 50, AND YOU COULD GET YOUR HIGHLIGHTS, AND I PROMISE YOU, YOU COULD BRING THE PEOPLE IN, THAT WOULD BE THE LIGHT IN YOU. BOB: THAT IS SO INTERESTING. NOW, AND WHEN, AND WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I WAS PROBABLY 18, AND THE LORD TOOK ME TO HEAVEN. GUEST: I KNOW. I CAN SEE THIS ALL OVER YOU. AND WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT HEAVEN, AND THE GLORY COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, AND IT IS LIKE A LIGHT AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE AND I CAN FEEL IT, I CAN FEEL IT. JANE: BOB: IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT. BUT I'VE NEVER HAD ANOTHER EXPERIENCE. AND YOU, AND YOU GO THERE ALL OF THE TIME. GUEST: I HAVE A COMMISSION AND GOD GAVE ME A COMMISSION AND HE SAYS, AND THE FATHER WOULD TAKE ME ON A TOUR OF HEAVEN AND THAT WAS IN 1996, AND THERE WAS A PURPOSE FOR IT AND I SAID YES AND YOU KNOW AND I HAVE KNOWN THE LORD SINCE I WAS 4 YEARS OF AGE, I HAVE SERVED HIM ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE MADE MY MISTAKES AND I WAS NOT PERFECT IN ANY WAY, BUT I DID REPENT A LOT. AND MY FATHER WAS A MISSIONARY, AND I WAS RAISED ON THESE FOUNDATIONS OF HOLINESS AND THE LOVE OF GOD. AND WE WERE NOT PERFECT BUT WE KNEW THAT GOD LOVED US, AND THIS WOULD BE SO IMPORTANT, I CAN RELATE SO WELL TO THE FATHER'S. I HAD A WONDERFUL EARTHLY FATHER. AND YOUR REAL FATHER IS IN HEAVEN, AND HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW HIM, AND SO I HAD A COMMISSION, AND I HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM MY WONDERFUL JOB, I HAD A LAW FIRM, I HAD A WONDERFUL SALARY, AND THEY SAID WE CAN SPEND THE NEXT YEARS PREPARING YOU FOR YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT. I HAD MEANT TO GET COUNTERS WITH THE LORD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT BEGAN TO SHOW ME REVELATION OF THE WORD, AND GOD WAS TOUCHING MY LIFE AND SEND ME OUT AND ASSIGNMENTS, AND MAYBE WHEN I WOULD GO TO THE AIRPORT I WOULD GO TO A FOOD COURT AND GIVE A CERTAIN PERSON A WORD. AND THEY WERE TRAINING ME TO GO AND WHATEVER THEY WANTED ME TO DO AND AT THE END OF THE 3 YEARS, AND GOD CAME THROUGH MY HOME AND HE SAID SIT DOWN, AND THE FATHER AND I WILL TAKE YOU ON A TOUR OF HEAVEN AND THIS IS WHAT WE WERE PREPARED FOR. I HAD TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND TRUST THE LORD. AND I HAD TO TRUST THE LORD. AND WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT FOR GOD YOU KNOW THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SACRIFICES YOU MAKE AND IT IS SO WORTH IT. AND THEY TOOK ME TO HEAVEN FROM THAT DAY FORWARD AND THEY DO NOT STOP NOW. AND I HAVE SEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ON PURPOSE. AND THEY WANT THE WORLD, TO KNOW WHAT HEAVEN IS REALLY LIKE, AND THAT THE HOUSE OF GOD IS LIKE A WORLD. AND YOU KNOW AND MAYBE WOULD BE MAYBE A BUILDING. AND THE BIBLE SAYS IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE WOULD BE MANY MANSIONS, AND MAYBE PEOPLE SEE THIS INSIDE OF A BUILDING, AND HE IS THE GREAT CREATOR, AND EVERYTHING IS MADE AND IT WOULD BE LIKE A WORLD BIGGER THAN THE UNIVERSE. AND THAT WOULD BE PLENTY OF ROOM, I HAVE SEEN THE MANSIONS, IT WAS LIKE A CITY AND IT BELONGED TO PROBABLY A MISSIONARY. AND SO, YES. JANE: AND WE HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT LOST LOVED ONES AND THEY LOVE JESUS, AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE IN HEAVEN, WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS WE KNOW. AND WHAT HAPPENS AS SOON AS YOU ARE BORN AGAIN, AND YOU LOVE JESUS AND YOUR SPIRIT LEAVES YOUR BODY BUT WHAT HAPPENS? GUEST: YES, IT DOES AND MAYBE LET'S SAY, LET ME BACK UP, AND YOU KNOW AND THE LORD DID TAKE ME AND I WAS PRESENT WHEN SOMEBODY PASSED AWAY, AND THEN I COULD FOLLOW THEM IN THE SPIRIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. AND I CAN SHARE IN DETAIL WHAT THEY WERE SHOWING ME AND WHAT I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT PEOPLE COULD NO. IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL THING. AND MAYBE THEY WERE SICK OR HANDICAPPED AND VERY OLD, AND WHEN YOUR SPIRITUAL BODY, AND WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR BODY, OKAY? WE ARE A SPIRIT 1ST, RIGHT? AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR SPIRIT, AND THIS WOULD BE FROM THE TIME OF CONCEPTION, AND THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WAS ATTACHED TO YOUR FLESH. AND THEY HAVE FOUND OUT, AND WHEN CONCEPTION HAPPENS, THERE WOULD BE A FLASH OF LIGHT, AND THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN IT AT THE CONCEPTION. AND THAT IS THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THIS IS WHAT HE DOES AND YOU ARE MADE OF LIFE. YOU ARE MADE OUT OF LIGHT. AND I WAS ASTOUNDED MANY YEARS AGO, WE HAD FOUND OUT, THE TIME OF CONCEPTION, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FLASH OF LIGHT IS BUT I COULD TELL THEM. AND THAT WOULD BE AN EVIDENCE THAT IT HAPPENS, AND SO FROM THIS TIME ONWARD, YOUR SPIRITUAL BODY BEGINS TO GROW INSIDE OF THE LITTLE, AND FOR THE WOMB OF THE MOTHER. AND ONE THING, ALSO, AND WE WERE INSIDE OF GOD, AND YOU KNOW THAT GOD CARRIED IS, AND GOD CARRIED US INSIDE OF HIMSELF, AND WE ARE SENT OUT OF HIM, AND ADAM HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF GOD INTO HIS NOSTRILS AND WHEN HE MADE THE BODY, HE GAVE GOD INTO HIMSELF, AND IT SAYS, AND WE HAD OUR VERY BEING IN HIM. AND THIS IS WHERE WE CAME FROM. AND WE ARE IN THE RIVER OF LIFE, AND THE LORD SAYS, I HAVE WATER IN THE WOMB, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE FAMILIAR AND HOW ABOUT THAT? AND THIS WOULD BE FROM REVELATION. AND YES AND FROM THE TIME YOU DIE, AND YOUR BODY, AND THIS IS NOT AGING, AND MAYBE YOUR LASHES AGING, BUT THE REAL YOU IS NOT AGING, AND YOU WILL LOOK LIKE YOU WOULD BE IN YOUR TWENTIES WHEN YOU STEP OUT OF YOUR BODY, AND WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE BODY, AND YOU WOULD HAVE THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE LIFE OF GOD, AND YOU CAN SEE YOUR GUARDIAN ANGELS FOR THE 1ST TIME, AND THEY WILL TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN, AND THEN YOU WOULD BE PICKED UP AND I'VE SEEN THE TRANSPORTS, AND PEOPLE OF LEFT IN CHARIOTS, AND JESUS CAN PICK YOU UP HIMSELF. IF YOU HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. AND YOU COULD GO BACK TO HEAVEN AND YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN, AND NOBODY STAYS HERE AND YOU CANNOT STAY HERE, AND YOU WOULD GO ONE PLACE OR THE OTHER, I HAVE SEEN HELL BUT WANT TO TALK ABOUT HEAVEN. AND YOU WOULD GO THROUGH THE UNIVERSE AND YOU WOULD SEE THE MOST BEATABLE THINGS, ALL OF THE PLANETS, THE NEBULAE, AND THEN YOU CONCEDE HEAVEN, AND YOU WOULD BE IN YOUR SPIRITUAL BODY SO YOUR EYES WOULD BE OPENED, IT WOULD BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING AND THE LIGHT IS BLASTING OUT INTO NOTHINGNESS AND MILLIONS OF ANGELS, AND GO FROM THIS PLACE ALL OF THE TIME, AND IT WOULD BE LIKE STREAMING, AND MAYBE 1000 ANGELS, AND JUST SPINNING IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR GLORIFYING GOD AND WORSHIPING GOD, THE SERAPHIM COME FROM OVER THE THRONE, AND LIKE THE BLUE FIRE, THEY WOULD HAVE THE FIRE OF GOD, IT WOULD BE LIKE THEY ARE ON FIRE, AND YOU ARE ASTOUNDED AT THE BEAUTY AND THE SPLENDOR GOING UP TO HEAVEN, AND THEY WOULD BE A PLACE FOR YOU DISEMBARK AND MAYBE YOU WOULD GET OFF OF A SHIP. AND YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER PEOPLE GETTING OFF OF THE CHARIOTS AND YOUR FAMILY, AND THEY CAN BE AT THE GATE AND THAT WOULD BE AWAY, AND YOU CAN SEE THE RIVER OF LIFE, AND THIS FLOWS OUT OF HEAVEN AND PEOPLE THROW THE WATER ON EACH OTHER AND JUMPING IN, AND NOT JUST YOUR FAMILY BUT YOUR PETS WILL MEET YOU, AND WE MIGHT AS WELL GO THERE AND BECAUSE GOD SAYS, AND BECAUSE YOU LOVE THEM AND WHEN HE MADE ADAM, HE HAD THE ANIMALS AND WE ARE NOT MEANT FOR LABOR, AND THEY SHOULD BE OUR COMPANIONS. AND OUTGOING TO THAT LATER BUT ANYWAY, THE PETS GO TO HEAVEN, AND IT SAYS, FROM GENESIS, AND GOD TOOK ME BACK TO THE WORD, AND ABOUT THE PETS GOING TO HEAVEN AND HE SAYS TO NOAH, AND HE HAD THE SPIRIT OF LIFE AND THEM, AND THIS WAS A SPIRITUAL BODY AND SO WHEN YOUR PET DIES, AND WHEN YOU'RE ANGELS WILL TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN, YOU WILL GO TO YOUR MANSION, AND YOU WILL NOT MAKE A MESS IN YOUR MANSION. AND I HAVE SEEN THIS PLACE WHEN THEY DISEMBARK, AND THEY WILL GRAB YOU AND HUG YOU, AND THEY WILL LOVE YOU, AND THEN YOU WOULD BE TAKEN INTO THE THRONE ROOM, AND IF THEY COULD GET YOU OUT OF THE RIVER OF LIFE. AND SOMETIMES JESUS IS IN THE RIVER OF LIFE, AND HE SPLASHES WATER ON YOU, AND YOU WILL LAUGH LIKE CHILDREN AND YOU WILL LAUGH AND LAUGH AND YOU WILL BE OVERWHELMED AT THE BEAUTY AND THE FLOWERS SINGING AND THE COLORS WOULD BE MOVING, AND THERE IS SO MUCH GLORIOUS MUSIC AND YOU CONCEDE THE GLORY, AND YOU CAN SEE THE GLORY OF GOD ALL OVER THIS PLACE AND IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING. AND THEN YOU COULD GO INTO THE GATES, AND INTO THE THRONE ROOM OF GOD AND JESUS WILL TAKE YOU HIMSELF, AND BACK UP THE STEPS AND YOU'LL BE GIVEN BACK TO THE FATHER, AND WHEN HE SAYS HE WOULD SHOW YOU THIS, AND JESUS WAS GIVEN A REWARD FOR HIS CROSS, BUT HE TOOK EACH PERSON BACK UP THE STEPS TO THE FATHER AND WHEN THEY CAME HOME AND HE GAVE THEM BACK TO THE FATHER. AND HE SAYS I AM THE ONLY WAY BACK TO THE FATHER. AND HE MEANS IT LITERALLY. AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE IT AND I'LL SAY AND THERE IS JUST ONE WAY TO HEAVEN, AND THAT WOULD BE THROUGH CHRIST AND THAT WOULD BE NO OTHER WAY OR ENTRANCE, IT IS HIS BLOOD, AND THAT WOULD WIPE THE SIN OUT OF YOU AND THAT WILL MAKE YOU ACCEPTABLE TO GOD, AND GOD SAYS, THAT YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE, AND THEY SAY THAT GOD WON'T SEND YOU TO HELL, BUT I SAY THE BLOOD IS NOT MET BECAUSE YOU GO TO HELL AND YOU WILL BUT IF YOU DON'T RECEIVE THIS, BUT I WILL PUT THE BLOOD OF CHRIST ON YOU, BUT IF ANYBODY GOES TO HEAVEN WITHOUT CHRIST, HEAVEN WOULD BE LIKE THE EARTH. AND YOU CAN SAY, I CANNOT ALLOW THIS, AND YOU WILL BE WASHED OF ALL OF YOUR EVIL. AND JESUS WILL TAKE YOU BACK UP THE STAIRWELL TO HEAVEN, AND THERE IS SUCH CELEBRATION, AND THE THRONE IS SO HUGE, AND I HAVE BEEN IN THERE AND I COULD NOT SEE THE CEILING, AND THE GLORY OVER THE THRONE, AND THERE ARE THE SERAPHIM AND THEY ARE LIVING CREATURES, AND THEY WILL BE FILLING YOU WITH AMAZEMENT AND THEY ARE HUGE, AND THEY HAVE EYES THROUGHOUT THEIR ODDITIES LIKE REVELATION 4 AND WHAT JOHN WAS SEEING AND THIS IS SO MUCH AND YOU ARE UNDONE, AND YOU SEE THE WATER FLOWING DOWN THE STEPS AND YOU SEE THE THRONE, AND THE THRONE IS HIGH AND LIFTED UP, AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT WERE CAUGHT UP, AND YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE LIKE THE ENTIRE CRYSTAL SEA, AND I COULD MAKE, I CAN SEE WHERE YOU WOULD BE UNDONE. AND YOU HAVE THE GLORIOUS MOUNTAINS AND THE GEMSTONES, AND YOU WOULD BE LIKE, THIS WOULD BE LIKE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS OF FIRE 10 STORIES TALL, AND PEOPLE SAY, AND WHY WOULD BE OUTSIDE? AND HE COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE THRONE, AND HE HAS MORE THAN ONE THRONE AND HE CAN AFFORD IT. AND THEN YOU SEE THE GLORY WHEN YOU GO UP THE STEPS, AND YOU SEE THE FATHER REACHING OUT. AND HE WILL HOLD YOU TO HIMSELF, AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE, AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FEELING, AND THIS WOULD BE NO LOVE LIKE YOU'VE EVER KNOWN IN YOUR LIFE. IT WOULD CONSUME EVERY PART OF YOUR LIFE AND THIS WOULD BE A WELCOME HOME PARTY. AND THIS WOULD BE SO GLORIOUS, AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAME FROM HIM AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD BE HOME, THIS WOULD BE A TEMPORARY PLACE BUT THIS IS HOME. OUR CITIZENSHIP IS IN HEAVEN AND SO WE ALL HAVE THESE THINGS, AND MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER THEY HAVE COME HOME THEY WILL SAY, AND THEY WILL GIVE YOU CERTAIN REWARDS AND EVERYBODY CELEBRATES AND THEY DANCE AND YOU HAVE THE WELCOME HOME PARTY, AND YOU DON'T GET A SMALL PARTY IN HEAVEN, AND EVERYBODY WATCHES THEIR FUNERAL ON THE EARTH, AND THEY WILL SAY FUNNY THINGS, AND MAYBE HAVE THE HAPPY SONGS, AND I SAY LOOK UP, AND IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING THEY ARE WATCHING YOU, AND THEY ARE GLAD THAT YOU REMEMBER YOUR LIFE ON THE EARTH, AND THERE IS AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY TO LIVE NOW. JESUS AND THE FATHER. BOB: AND YOU WERE SAYING IT IS A PARTY, AND YOU WERE SAYING, AND EMPLOYEE, WHO JUST WENT HOME TO BE WITH THE LORD. AND THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD THE FAMILY, AND JUST TO HAVE THAT PARTY. BECAUSE, AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD THE GLIMPSE OF THE PARTY THAT HE WOULD BE HAVING, OR NOT. JANE: HE HAD SUCH A SENSE OF HUMOR. GUEST: AND YES, HE WILL HAVE A GREAT TIME. JANE: HE HAD A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR. AND THERE IS A BOOK AND THIS IS CALLED REVEALING HEAVEN, AND THIS WILL REVEAL THIS WOULD BE IT ON YOUR SCREEN. AND YES, AND YOU CANNOT PUT THIS DOWN. GUEST: AND YOU AND SOMETIMES I READ THE BOOK MYSELF AND THEY BECOME EXCITED MYSELF. AND THIS WOULD BE HIS REVELATION, AND THIS DOES TOUCH ME AND I'VE GOT THE CDS AND DVDS, AND SOME OF THESE THINGS WOULD NOT BE IN MY BOOK AND I'VE GOT TO THIS REVELATION BEFORE I WROTE THE BOOK AND EVEN AFTERWARDS, I WOULD BECOME SO EXCITED, AND I NEED TO KNOW, I NEED TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE IN CHRIST. JANE: WE WILL BE TAKING A BREAK AND SHE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE RECENTLY FOR HER.

AND IS THAT TRUE? GUEST: ABSOLUTELY AND EVEN THE FLOWERS, THE FLOWER SING, AND THE CLOTHING WILL MAKE MUSIC, AND THAT WOULD BE REAL GARMENTS OF PRAISE IN HEAVEN AND THAT WOULD BE IN THE WORD OF GOD, AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAVE THIS AS A REWARD, AND WE SAW THIS HAPPENING, AND THE FATHER, HE WAS REWARDING SOMEONE FOR USING THEIR GIFT, AND LOVING THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE SONGS AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DID, AND HE GOT A LITTLE TREASURE CHEST, AND HE SAYS OUT GIVE YOU THE GARMENT OF PRAISE. IT WAS SMALL, HOWEVER IT WAS LIKE, IT WAS ALIVE IT WOULD BE HARD TO EXPLAIN AND LIFE IS EVERYWHERE IN HEAVEN. AND I CAN SEE THE MUSIC AND I COULD SEE THE SONGS, AND THAT WOULD BE STRANGE. YOU CAN SEE THE MUSIC AND YOU DON'T JUST HEAR IT OR FEEL IT BUT YOU CAN SEE IT. I SAW A BEAUTIFUL SONG IT WAS LIKE A LOVELY COLOR, AND THIS BECAME A BEAUTIFUL GOWN, AND SHE WAS OVERWHELMED AND WHEN SHE WOULD MOVE HER HAND, YOU COULD HEAR THE MUSIC OUT OF THE GARMENT, YOU CAN HAVE THE GARMENT OF PRAISE AS YOUR REWARD. AND EVEN YOUR CLOTHING WILL WORSHIP GOD AND THAT WOULD BE SO MANY FORMS OF MUSIC AND THAT WOULD BE ONE, AND MAYBE WOULD HEAR THE HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGING, IT SOUNDS LIKE MILLIONS OF VOICES WORKING TOGETHER, AND THERE WERE INSTRUMENTS THAT I NEVER HAVE SEEN ON THE EARTH, AND YOU WILL BE DELIGHTED AND AMAZED AND WHEN YOU GO TO HEAVEN. AND MUSIC IS ALL OVER HEAVEN. AND THE WALLS MAKE MUSIC IN THE MANSIONS, AND YOU WILL WALK IN THE DOOR OF YOUR MANSION, AND THERE COULD BE FLOWERS GROWING OUT OF THE WALLS IF YOU LIKE THAT. AND SOMETIMES THEY SAY WELCOME HOME AND SING TO YOU. AND WORSHIP IS ALL OVER HEAVEN, AND THE SERAPHIM ARE SINGING AND THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. AND I HAVE SEEN THE IRIDESCENT BEINGS, THEY WOULD STEP OUT OF THE WATER AND THE WATER SINGS, AND EVERYTHING IS GLOWING, AND EVERYTHING WORSHIPS JESUS IN HEAVEN. BOB: AND WELL, AND I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING, AND JUST RECENTLY, I LEARNED THIS ABOUT GOD RECENTLY AND I ABOUT, AND ABOUT HIS CREATION AND ABOUT THE HEAVENS. AND, AND THEY, AND HE, I GUESS, HE, AND HE IS STILL AND HE IS STILL CREATING. AND THAT WOULD BE AN AMAZING THING TO ME. BECAUSE WE CAN SEE OUT, AND WE CAN SEE OUT HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF LIGHT-YEARS, AND EVEN BEYOND THAT, BUT HE IS CREATING. AND IS THAT NOT AMAZING? GUEST: YES, HE IS AND ONE OF THE THINGS I DID NOT SAY, AND WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE THRONE AND IF YOU LOOK DOWN, AND THE STEPS AND YOU WILL SEE CREATION TAKING PLACE IT IS EVERYWHERE HE IS ALWAYS CREATING NEW THINGS IN HEAVEN ALL OF THE TIME AND PEOPLE GO HOME TO HEAVEN, HE WILL MAKE A SPECIAL THING JUST FOR THEM AND HE WILL MAKE SPECIAL PLACES AND EVEN OUT IN THE UNIVERSE HE IS ALWAYS CREATING AND PEOPLE KNOW THIS ABOUT THE NEBULAE, AND THE BABY STARS, AND THIS WOULD BE FOR THE BABY STARS. AND I WAS LEARNING THIS AND THE LORD TOLD ME MANY YEARS AGO, AND HE SAID, AND THERE WERE SMALL LIGHTS, AND NOW THEY HAVE DISCOVERED AND THEY CAN EVEN SAY, AND THIS WOULD BE LIKE A NEST FOR THE BABY STARS AND THEY GROW BRIGHTER, AND FINALLY THEY LEAVE THE NEST AND THEY WILL FLOAT OUT INTO THE UNIVERSE. AND HE IS SO GOOD. HE IS ALWAYS CREATING AND THIS IS WHAT HE DOES HE IS THE CREATOR. AND WE CAN CREATE THINGS WITHOUT WORDS, AND WE HAVE SPRINGS OF LIVING WATER WHEN WE SPEAK, AND WE CAN RELEASE HOPE, AND OUR WORDS ARE SO IMPORTANT AND WHEN HE SPOKE, AND THIS WOULD BE A GREAT REVELATION I WANT TO SHARE THIS, AND BECAUSE I KNOW THE WORD SAYS FROM JOHN, AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE LORD AND THAT HE WAS THE WORD AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD, THAT WOULD BE THE FATHER, AND HE WAS GOD, AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS NOT MADE BY HIM, AND THIS WOULD BE THE WORD AND THAT IS JESUS, AND IT SAYS THE WORD HAS CREATED, AND I BELIEVE AND I KNOW THE ANSWER AND I KNOW THAT JESUS CAN STEP INSIDE OF THE FATHER, AND HE SAYS AND YOU AND ME, AND ALL OF US, AND HE SAYS, YOU CAN DO THIS WHEN YOU GO TO HEAVEN AND YOU CAN STEP INSIDE, AND THE HOLY GHOST APPS INSIDE AND WE ARE ONE. AND THAT WOULD BE THE GOAL AND HE WANTS US TO BE ONE. AND WHAT HE DOES AND BEFORE JESUS CAME AND BEFORE WE HAD THE WORD, AND HE WOULD STEP INSIDE OF THE FATHER, AND THE FATHER WOULD SPEAK AND WHATEVER HE SPOKE AND THE WORD WOULD STEP OUT AND HE COULD MAKE IT. AND THE THING THAT HE WAS SHOWING ME AND HOW HE MADE THE PHYSICAL REALM AND THE FATHER SPOKE AND THE SPIRITUAL REALM HAS ALWAYS EXISTED, AND THIS IS A SPIRITUAL WORLD AND WHEN HE IS READY TO CREATE THE UNIVERSE, AND HE SPEAKS ABOUT WHEN HE MAKES IT, AND HE SPOKE AND THE FATHER SPOKE AND THE WORD, TOOK THE SCROLL, AND HE TOOK IT AROUND THE REALM A, AND THIS BECAME THE PHYSICAL REALM AND THE PLANETS WERE ON IT. AND HE PUT THEM ON IT AND HE SAYS UNTO ME I SPEAK ABOUT THIS FROM THE WORD, AND AT THE END, I WILL PUT THIS AWAY LIKE AN OLD GARMENT, AND I KNOW WHAT THE END IS. AND THE WORD SAYS, HE STRETCHED OUT OF THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN. AND THIS IS LIKE A SCROLL. AND THIS IS LIKE WHAT THE WORD SAYS, AND THE WORD MAKES IT AND HE DOES IT. JANE: AND GOT HIS BEEN SPEAKING TO YOU, AND HE SAID, YOU COULD SHARED THIS ON THE PROGRAM TODAY. AND WE WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT IT. GUEST: AND YES AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE TIME AND GOD HAS A TIMELINE, AND GOD SHOWED ME AND GOT HIS CREATED TIME, CORRECT? AND THE FATHER WOULD BE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TIME IN HIS HAND, AND YOU KNOW AND JESUS DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE COULD COME BACK, AND THAT BELONGS TO THE FATHER, AND HE CREATED TIME, AND HE KNOWS WHEN THINGS HAPPEN AND THIS IS HOW HE HAS DONE IT, AND FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. AND WE SAYS THE END, AND HE DOES NOT MEAN THAT ANYTHING WOULD BE ENDING, BUT THIS WOULD BE THE END OF TIME AND SPACE, AND THAT WOULD BE NO TIME THAT WE WOULD BE BOUND TO, AND THERE IS NO TIME, AND IT WOULD BE NO TIME AT ALL, AND WE COULD BE IN MORE THAN ONE PLACE, AND THAT WOULD BE NO LIMIT, AND THINGS ARE LAYERED IN THE SPIRIT REALM AND IT IS MIND-BOGGLING TO UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS ABOUT HEAVEN. AND I AM NOT A PHYSICIST OR SOMETHING AND I'VE GOT A 12 YEAR EDUCATION AND I'VE HAD SOME COLLEGE BUT THE BIBLE SAYS HE IS DELIGHTED WHEN HE CREATES, AND HE WANTS TO SHOW US HIS MYSTERIES. AND WHEN I SEE THESE THINGS, BUT ON THE TIMELINE, RIGHT NOW, IT IS NOT THE LAST DAY, AND IT WOULD NOT BE TIME FORTUNE RELATION, AND IT IS NOT PERILOUS, AND I KNOW PEOPLE, AND WITH THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND THEY MIGHT SAY SO MUCH IS GOING ON WITH ALL OF THE WARS, BUT YOU REMEMBER THE BOOK OF MARK AND WHEN THE LORD SAYS, YOU WILL KNOW WHEN SOMETHING IS CLOSE AND WILL COME TO THE END, AND WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS HAPPENING BUT THE END IS NOT YET, AND WILL BE WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS AND NATIONS WILL RISE AGAINST NATION BUT THE END IS NOT YET AND WE ARE STILL AWAITING, AND THERE ARE TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE NOT DONE, AND WE DON'T HAVE JOLT 2 TAKING PL. YET, AND I HAVE SEEN THE GLIMPSES OF THIS, AND THIS WILL SHOCK THE WORLD WHEN THIS BEGINS TO HAPPEN, AND WHEN THE MANIFEST PRESENCE OF GOD BEGINS TO TOUCH EVERYBODY. I CONCEDE THE PILL THINGS, CRYING OUT TO KNOW GOD. I CAN SEE, THE BELIEVERS CARRYING THE GLORY, IT LOOKED LIKE LIQUID LIGHT AND THE GLORY WOULD GO ALL OVER THEM, AND HEALED AND THEY WOULD GO AROUND PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO LIFE EVEN THE MORTUARIES, AND YOU REMEMBER PETER AND HIS SHADOW, IT WAS NOT A HUMAN SHADOW THAT WAS THE GLORY COMING OUT OF HIM THAT WOULD TOUCH THE PEOPLE TO BE MAGNIFIED. AND ALSO AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN, AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT ROMANS 8, FOR THE SONS AND THE DAUGHTERS STAND UP AND BEGIN TO SHOW THE POWER OF GOD AND THE EARTH. AND THE EARTH IS CRYING OUT AND IT IS IN TRAVAIL AND THIS WOULD BE IN ROMANS, AND THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT TIME IT WOULD BE, WE NEED FOR THE SONS AND THE DAUGHTERS AND LIKE THE BOOK OF JOEL WE NEED JOEL, ALSO ISAIAH CHAPTER 60. AND WILL YOU LEAVE THE BIBLE? AND GOD IS NOT CHANGING HIS MIND. I HAVE BEEN SHOWN SOME OF THE TIMES ON THE EARTH, AND HE TELLS ME AND THIS WOULD BE THE MOST EXCITING TIME TO BE ALIVE AS A BELIEVER, WE WILL STAND UP AND WE WOULD PUSH BACK IN THE DARK AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS GLORY WILL BE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD, AND JESUS SPOKE ALL OF THE TIME ABOUT THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM, AND WE ARE BORN AGAIN BUT WE HAVE GOT A KINGDOM THAT WE WOULD BE A PART OF, AND THIS IS A POWERFUL WORD. AND WE DON'T RULE OVER THE PEOPLE, BUT WE WILL HAVE ALL OF THE POWER OF THE ENEMY, NO MATTER HOW GREAT THE DARKNESS WOULD BE, AND WE HAVE THE POWER OVER THE ENEMY, AND WE CAN STEP ON THE SNAKES AND THE SCORPIONS, EVEN THOSE THESE ARE DEMONIC BEINGS, AND WE HAVE RULERSHIP OVER THEM, IF WE WILL TAKE IT, AND WE CAN USE THE NAME OF CHRIST AND WE USE HIS WORD AND THE BLOOD, AND THESE THINGS ARE POWERFUL AND WE HAVE THE WEAPON THAT WE HAVE NOT, AND WE HAVE NOT AND WE DON'T HAVE A WEAPON THAT WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT YET, AND THERE IS A TIME IN ISAIAH, AND ISRAEL WAS IN TROUBLE AND THEY WERE PRAYING, AND THEY WERE PRAYING AND GOD BROUGHT THE ARMIES OF HEAVEN TO DEFEND THEM, AND IT SAYS, AND THEY HAD BEEN SENT FOR US TO GUARD US, AND THEY ARE NOT GUARDING HEAVEN WHAT ARE THE ANGELS DOING, AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING? AND THEY WANT TO STAND UP AND TO TAKE THE POWER OF CHRIST, AND WE CAN SEND THEM TO PULL DOWN THE STRONGHOLDS AND THIS IS HAPPENING AND THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE, THIS HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. JANE: NOT GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU MIGHT PRAY, AND HOW WOULD YOU SPEAK IT OUT? GUEST: AND WHENEVER THEY MY SHOW ME SOMETHING I AM TRAINED. THEY DON'T JUST SAY SOMETHING BUT THEY WILL TRAIN ME, LIGHT THEY DID THE DISCIPLES, AND IF WE DO NOT KNOW AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH OF THE REVELATION, AND WHEN HE SHOWS ME SOMETHING THIS WOULD BE FOR EVERYBODY AND NOT JUST FOR ME, AND WHEN YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, YOU MUST HAVE JESUS IN YOUR LIFE, AND YOU'LL BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT AND YOU MUST HAVE HIM, AND YES, YOU MUST HAVE HIM IN YOUR LIFE. AND WHEN YOU ENGAGE HEAVEN, YOU MUST INVITE HIM IN, AND THIS IS NOT LIKE WORSHIPING ANGELS, AND WHERE THE ANGELS FELL AND THEY BECAME LIKE GOD'S. AND THEY DID BECOME GOD'S TO THE EGYPTIANS, THE AZTECS, BUT THIS IS NOT THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE, THE REVELATION OF IT. AND THE ANGEL SHOULD BRING MESSAGES, AND THEY SHOULD BRING HEALING AND SO MANY THINGS, AND THEY ARE SENT FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS, AND MICHAEL HE HAS HAD AN ENTIRE ARMY THAT IS WAITING FOR US TO STAND UP, AND WE MUST BE RELEASED UPON THE ARMIES OF THE DARKNESS. JANE: IS THAT WHAT YOU SAY? GUEST: AND THIS IS WHAT I SAY AND WHEN I MAYBE KNOW OF A SITUATION, AND MAYBE A NEW GANG HAS COME IN, I WILL SAY I DON'T TOLERATE IT, AND THE LORD TOLD ME NOT TO TOLERATE THE DARK AND DON'T TOLERATE FEAR AND DO NOT TOLERATE LACK, AND WE ARE TOLERATING THESE THINGS AND WE NEED TO STOP IT. WE NEED TO BE FED UP WITH IT. AND WE SHOULD TAKE IT BY FORCE AND WE SHOULD TAKE IT TO THE LORD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THIS WILL NOT HARM YOU AND THIS WOULD BE THE SCRIPTURES AND WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE ENEMY, AND WE SAY THAT WE CAN TAKE THE POWER AND THE AUTHORITY OVER ALL OF THE DEMONIC CONTROLLING, ALL OF THE GANGS, AND GIVING THEM THE IDEAS, AND MAKING THEM BE BOLD AND FEARLESS AND I TAKE AWAY ALL OF THE POWER BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE POWER OVER ALL OF THE POWER OF THE ENEMY. AND WE DON'T TOLERATE IT. AND THEN I TELL THE ANGELS TO GO PULL DOWN THESE THINGS OPERATING IN THE GANGS, AND IMMEDIATELY, THEY WILL GO, AND THEY WILL LOOK LIKE TEAMS OF LIGHT, AND THEY WILL PULL DOWN THE STRONGHOLDS, AND EVEN WHERE THE ENEMY HAS BEEN DROOLING OVER THE REGIONS,, AND YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PULL DOWN THE STRONGHOLD. AND IT IS YOUR WEAPONS THAT WOULD NOT BE CARNAL. THEY ARE SPIRITUAL, AND THEY ARE MIGHTY TO THE PULLING DOWN OF THE STRONGHOLDS. AND SO ONE OF THE WEAPONS WOULD BE THE HOST OF HEAVEN, AND WE NEED TO ACTIVATE IT. AND THESE THINGS HEAVEN SITTING AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, AND I SAW MILLIONS OF THE ANGELS RELEASED UPON THE EARTH, AND GOD SAYS IT IS TIME TO RULE FOR CHRIST, AND JESUS SAYS AND REMEMBER THE WORD AND HE SAID I COULD CALL MILLIONS OF ANGELS, AND JESUS WAS STANDING AS A MAN AND HE SAID THIS, BECAUSE HE WAS GIVING THIS AS AN EXAMPLE AND THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE WEAPONS AND MIGHT NOW AND GREAT DARKNESS WOULD BE COMING OVER THE EARTH AND WE HAVE THE HOST OF HEAVEN WAITING, AND I SEE THESE THINGS, AND I HAVE THAT GIFT, AND PEOPLE CANNOT DO IT ON THEIR OWN, AND YOU KNOW AND YOU CAN SEE, AND ELIJAH SAW THESE THINGS, AND HE WOULD NOT OF SAID THESE THINGS, BUT I CAN SEE THESE THINGS EVERYWHERE UP IN THE SKY, AND THEY CAN JUST BE WAITING, AND WE DON'T SAY ANYTHING AND WE SEE THE NEGATIVE, AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE WORD, AND YOU GIVE THEM THE AGREEMENT OF THE WORD AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. YOU GIVE THEM THE WORD. AND YOU SAY YOU DECLARE IT AND WE HAVE THE WEAPONS THAT WOULD PULL DOWN STRONGHOLDS. AND WHEN YOU SAY THESE THINGS, THE ARMIES ARE SO EXCITED AND THEY WILL GO AND DESTROY THE STRONGHOLDS AND THE ENTIRE REGION CAN BE RELEASED, AND THE ANOINTING WILL BREAK THE YOKE, AND YOU HAVE THE ANOINTING INSIDE OF YOU, AND THAT BREAKS THE YOKE OF THE DARKNESS, AND WE HAVE THE WEAPONS AND WE HAVE THESE THINGS AND THEY WOULD BE SO POWERFUL AND THEY WOULD BE FOR THIS TIME, AND WE CAN BEGIN AND I KNOW FOR A FACT AND WOULD BE SO MUCH LIGHT CREATED BY THE BELIEVERS OPERATING IN THE POWER THAT JESUS HAS GIVEN US THROUGH THE BLOOD AND WE HAVE THE GLORY AND CRIME IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXIST. AND I CAN SEE THE PEOPLE, AND BECAUSE THE GLORY WOULD BE SO POWERFUL, AND WE CAN RULE AND REIGN WITH CHRIST. AND THE WORD SAYS WE ARE THE KINGS, AND WE ARE THE PRIEST UNTO GOD. THESE WOULD BE SPIRITUAL LEVELS OF AUTHORITY. I HAVE A LOT OF REVELATION ABOUT THE AUTHORITY OF THE BELIEVER. THIS WILL CHANGE MANY THINGS OF THIS WORLD. JANE: AND YOU PUT THIS IN YOUR BOOK? GUEST: AND YES I'VE ALREADY STARTED THE 3RD BOOK. I HAVE, AND I'VE GOT A CD AND THIS IS CALLED INVITE HEAVENS ARMY , AND THIS WOULD BE THE SCROLLS OF TIME OPENING, AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT RULING AND REIGNING WITH CHRIST. AND PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE, AND THIS CAN BE OUT ON YOUTUBE, AND PEOPLE HAVE THESE THINGS BROKEN OVER THEIR HOMES AND THEIR LIVES, THEIR ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESTORATION IS COMING QUICKLY TO THEM, AND EVEN YOUR FINANCES WILL CHANGE, AND I CAN STAND AND SAY I TAKE AUTHORITY OVER THE POWER OF THE ENEMY, OR WHATEVER THAT MIGHT TRY TO UNDO ME, AND I DO THIS BEFORE I GO NOW I SEND OUT THE ARMIES TO PULL DOWN THE STRONGHOLDS, AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT MIGHT BE DONE THE MEETINGS, AND THE HOST GOES BEFORE ME, AND THIS BRINGS ME SAFETY AND PROTECTION, IT OPENS OF THE PORTALS OF HEAVEN, AND THE ENEMY HAS BEEN REMOVED, AND THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD LIVE AND WE SHOULD NOT LIVE IN FEAR. AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT SPIRIT OF FEAR, BUT WE HAVE POWER, AND THAT WOULD BE THE POWER, THE LOVE AND THE SOUND MIND.

AND WE APPRECIATE OUR SPECIAL GUEST, AND SHE IS HERE WITH US TODAY. AND WE ARE SO GLAD THAT SHE IS HERE. AND SHE IS WITH US TODAY. AND SHE IS GOING TO BE REVEALING TO YOU, SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN REVEALED UNTO HER, RIGHT NOW SO, AND GET READY AND FASTEN YOUR SEATBELT, AND HERE SHE COMES. GUEST: AND VIOLENCE, AND VIOLENCE? AND THE SPIRITS OF VIOLENCE AND I HAD A AMAZING REVELATION GIVEN TO ME, BY THE FATHER RECENTLY AND I KNEW SOMEONE THAT A BEEN SICK FOR A LONG TIME, AND THEY WERE TRYING SO MANY THINGS AND THEY BEEN PRAYED OVER MANY TIMES, AND THE PEOPLE WERE FASTING AND PRAYING, AND THEN I WENT TO VISIT THEM IN THE HOSPITAL, AND WHEN I WENT IN, THEY SAID, THAT WOULD BE SPIRITS OF VIOLENCE IN THE ROOM, AND HE SAID, AND THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REMOVED, AND BEFORE THE HEALING COULD COME TO THE PERSON. AND WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT VIOLENCE, OR YOU WATCH THESE VIOLENT THINGS, HE SAYS, AND THESE WOULD BE SPIRITS OF DEATH. AND I WAS SHARING, AND THEY WERE SEEING SOMETHING ON THE IPAD, IT WAS DESTRUCTIVE, AND THEY WERE WATCHING, AND THIS PERSON WAS TERMINAL, AND YET THEY WERE WATCHING SOMETHING VIOLENT ON THE IPAD. AND THEN I SAID, I SAID, PLEASE STOP WATCHING THAT. AND WE BEGIN TO RELEASE THE LIFE OF GOD AND FOR THEIR LIFE, AND THE FATHER COULD SAY THEY WOULD RUN AND NOT WALK OR CRAWL, AND WHEN THIS HAPPENED, AND THEY WERE LIFTED UP OFF OF THE HOSPITAL BED, AND THE FATHER SAID, AND WE HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CANNOT BE CONNECTED TO THESE THINGS, AND ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT LUCIFER, HE WAS FILLED WITH VIOLENCE. IT IS DESTRUCTIVE, AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE VIOLENT, BUT YOU COULD BE VIOLENT AGAINST THE DARKNESS AND YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE AND BE BY FORCE, AND THAT WOULD BE OKAY. BUT IF YOU WATCH A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN YOUR HOME ALL OF THE TIME, AND THIS IS THE REASON YOU MIGHT BE SICK, AND WHY THE INFIRMITY HANGS AROUND YOU, YOU NEED TO GET IT OUT OF YOUR HOME AND OUT OF YOUR LIFE, AND DON'T SPEAK NEGATIVELY ABOUT YOURSELF AND DON'T TELL EVERYBODY WHAT IS WRONG, YOU ARE JUST CONFIRMING WHAT THE ENEMY WANTS TO DO, AND WE SHOULD SPEAK LIFE. AND CHANGE WHAT YOU SAY, AND WATCH WHAT YOU WATCH ON THE TV AND WHAT PEOPLE SEE IN YOUR HOME, AND MAYBE YOU WANT A HEALING. AND I THANK YOU THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THEY WILL SAY, AND KNOW THAT THIS GET DOWN INTO YOUR SOUL, AND DON'T LET THIS HINDER YOU AND YOUR HEALING. BOB: AMEN THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WORD. JANE: IT IS. BOB: NOW, THERE WOULD BE MANY PEOPLE WATCHING THIS, AND THEY ARE WATCHING THIS ALL OF THE WORLD. AND THEY, THEY ARE JUST THINKING ABOUT, AND THEY ARE THINKING AND WILL I GO TO HEAVEN? AND IS THIS REALLY REAL? AND WE WANT YOU TO LEAD THEM AND BRING THEM TO THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD JESUS. I WILL. THIS WOULD BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO, AND YOU KNOW, AND PERSONALLY I HAVE KNOWN THE LORD SINCE I WAS 4, I AM 63, WE WILL BECOME YOUNGER. BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW HIM, AND HE LOVES YOU. JESUS CAME AND HE DID DIE, AND HE GAVE HIMSELF FOR YOU AND THE LORD OF GLORY, AND HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW HIM AND THIS IS NOT THAT HARD, AND DON'T THINK THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE PERFECT, AND HOWEVER YOU ARE TODAY YOU CAN CHOOSE, AND YOU CAN SAY YOU ARE TIRED OF IT, YOU ARE TIRED OF THE DARK, YOU ARE TIRED OF BEING AFRAID, BUT YOU CAN SAY JESUS, I AM GIVING YOU MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I LAY DOWN MY LIFE AND I WILL SURRENDER TO YOU, I WILL REPENT OF MY SINS AND EVEN THE ONES I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT, I WILL REPENT AND I WANT TO RECEIVE YOU TO MYSELF, AND WHEN YOU DO THIS AND YOU RECEIVE HIM HE WILL COME INTO YOUR LIFE, AND YOU WILL BE CLEAN AND YOUR NAME WILL BE WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE AND YOU COULD BE WITH HIM IN ETERNITY. AND THAT WOULD BE NOTHING THAT WOULD BE WORTH MISSING AND ETERNITY, AND YOU COULD BE WITH HIM AND YOU CAN BELIEVE BY FAITH AND RECEIVE IT, AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AND YOU'LL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.

forgot that or somewhere in the body that was left on a shelf somewhere that prayer is powerful and it may be a seri we are kings and priests and to our god we're not just normal average people living on this earth if you're a member of the body of christ you are different and we have commissions no one else in this earth has we have rights opportunities promises and authority that no one else has except those who've received jesus christ as their savior and he gave it to us himself no one should be living or expecting fear or violence against them not one person in the body should be expecting or planning for it in any way whatsoever you should be taking authority over it crushing the plans of darkness pushing them back amen we're supposed to be a voice for god represent him manifest his absolute power and presence in this earth to move things and no longer be moved by things we're supposed to move them shake them and shift them for him so that's really who you are and we all have that same commission to do that we may have different ways we do that and everybody is needed by god everybody has a gift or is a gift and he needs all of us that's why we're a body i know some of them want to separate their cell from us i don't know what they think they're going to do is a finger or a leg somewhere you know without any part of a body to be with and i think the thing that would bless him the most is to see us coming together i'm excited about the prayer convocation you know if my people that is coming up in orlando and it will be live streamed everywhere you can go to um global fire ministries i think jeff johnson is involved in that that wild man i heard he was in charge he's my friend and i heard you're in charge am i coming [Laughter] because we really are praying it's about praying for the president for the elections for god's will god's way and i know i'm wearing yes i am wearing the president right here if you don't like him get over it he's not going away [Applause] we actually have some trump flags about that size back there on our table oh yeah flying as big and high as you can because heaven is heaven looks at his tweets you're like man yes they pray okay but still god chose him he is he is a wrecking ball he's also a bulldozer he's also a builder he inspires he does empower and no matter what anyone ever says to you he loves america and he loves the people of america all of us no matter what color we are or where we come from if you're an american trump loves you and what he does is for the people say for the people by the people that's what he believes that's actually what anybody in leadership in this country should believe that and be living that no one is a dictator although some would like to believe they are and are practicing that right now and they'll be sorry they practiced it i get a lot of inside information some from the trump administration some from heaven because nothing is hidden right i do have a message and it is about america it's about god's plans for america so you know what the truth is because there's so much stuff going on and by the way uh the tribulation isn't coming yet i'll throw that in if i say news bulletin if i whenever i say news building from heaven the holy spirit just said it to me and he's just saying to me it's not the tribulation it's not the perilous times the four hearses of the apocalypse are still in the barn he likes to say that one things are not going to get worse except for those who don't want god except for those who don't want life okay it they may have some real real strong issues coming up especially november the 3rd because trump will win [Applause] and it doesn't matter where i do a broadcast where i go and speak the father will say you better say that and say as bold and loud as you can that trump will win on november 3rd in 2020 because god wants us to have a life and a future not just hope for a future but a future greater than ever has been before because this all is happening in god's shifting time when he is going to shift and i know him well the first thing he does is expose all the darkness and i hear from people why is all this awful stuff going on it's been there all along it was just hidden and i literally just heard from someone in the trump administration saying make sure you talk about how deep the exposure will happen [Applause] and they know things we don't know right now i mean from the highest person in the land and there'll be domino's fall if you've ever seen dominoes fall it takes everything with it that is what will happen in the political arena in the news arena in the business arena in the line cheating stealing arena and those who paid and trained for the violence god god is not going to allow so you know what people will know the truth no matter what the fake news i don't have my button i should have brought my fake news button i was going to push it right now people i said where did you get that is really trump saying you're fake news you're just fake fake news you should see me embarrass your fake news and i think what these people don't understand that god chose someone who's not afraid of people he's not afraid of the darkness he's not afraid of evil obviously he's not afraid of being you know called names or wrongfully accused unjustly accused that doesn't even touch him so they're wasting their time and a lot of their money trying to make that happen and i know he has a plan i'm not telling you about that playing around i'm not telling you about trump's plan you'll find out about that but i can tell you that heaven's very excited about what's going to be happening over the next few months and especially this next year and i know bless her heart some of the millennials are thinking this is never going to end you know is are we ever even going to have a life you know we'll be able to live somewhere will we actually be alive or will we die and i go you need to know god because god has all those he has all those answers right and i'm always somewhere near where they're talking they don't know me but they're having discussions about how their life they're wondering if they'll be able to live you know if they can live through the virus plague it's not a plague people okay it's not a plague people act like it is they wanna they meant they wanna make you think it is and heaven is against social distancing [Applause] and they're even against the masks now if you feel like you have to wear one if you're going into the hospital if you're going to see senior citizens and they would rather you wear one than do it but trust me it's okay and i'm praying that on november 3rd trump will say i'm here to say go burn your masks he absolutely is not happy about these different governors and mayors saying you can't hold church you have to hold it outside you can't talk to each other you can't like [Laughter] they need jesus and and trump is not happy about any of that part and they're telling me he's getting more and more information because guess who he finally talked to people he didn't talk to the professionals who weren't giving him the truth i happen to know he's doing this he's actually talking to people people who know the truth about these things even considering i'm concerning the virus okay i've even stopped calling that the quarantine because i didn't want to call it a virus and i'm telling you this is what god has always said from the beginning it's going to pass it'll pass it'll be gone like it was never there and he said your lives will be so powerful and he wants us to know each other to come together because you know what the bible says about that right and i'm sure that the other side would like to keep us all apart because it gets dangerous the more of us who want what god wants it becomes dangerous for hell when we come together and so but i do have good news today that god is absolutely involved in this country and four years ago when he made the declaration that he would be involved for 24 years without stopping in the white house 24 years of god in the white house he hasn't changed his mind no matter what they're showing in the news or what they're saying broadcasting forecasting or just lying about it isn't going to help that side you need to really pray for them because it was devastating the last time that they lost and if they would stop feeding their own soul things that weren't true then they would not expect it to happen but unfortunately there's people who for the last these last four years kept feeding on what the fake news was saying i don't mind saying any of that okay i don't have no problem saying it anywhere because it's the truth they said lies i know people the kindest most gentle people have become almost vicious because it's filled their soul it's filled the layers of your soul as a man thinketh in his heart which is your soul that word heart means the core of your being that's where your soul is is a man thinketh in his soul so is he so because their thinking has changed over these last years because of what they're feeding in that's why he says guard your soul guard what you let go in god what you let go out because then you impact people's souls when you speak or prophet things and i can tell you from the god of heaven and earth he is fed up with the fake news he's fed up with the lying liberals that don't want life that want to control that want to take your life away every bit of this is true this is the truth okay their platform is the worst i've ever seen in my life you don't want communism or socialism i lived through these 60s as a teenager i know what that stuff was like and if you don't understand you should go look up some of the countries that that live that way and why are there people trying to escape venezuela is a good example i tell them why don't you go live there the ones that want it that way go take vacation and live there for two weeks and when you come back you won't want it anymore amen there is no life in that it's like death and god said this day i offer you life or death choose what so if you if you're agreeing with the side that wants death and even helps death you're on the wrong side choose life if you want life you choose life okay you offer life and what we say from here should bring life and hope and joy and even celebration and even creativity if we represent heaven in this earth then we should be like them amen everyone in heaven is rooting for trump there's a lot more for him than her against him i literally know people in foreign countries who are praying for him to win they don't want the other they don't want what's being offered especially if they're already living in it and these aren't anybody i even know and they don't even know me they don't know me for catker but people want life around this world they want hope if they have families and they love those families and god gave us our families to love to be a part of to share things with and yet there is a side who is owned by satan and you always know what that side is because it wants violence it portrays violence acts of violence and they don't care who they're violent against satan doesn't care who dies and the ones he's been using when they die he won't care either there is no love in that camp there's no love in hell's camp just death and destruction and he does not and hell is terrified right now they're terrified that's why they're doing whatever they can to show the worst saying this is the way it is they they want people to think all of america is in turmoil and they want civil war so bad i can't tell you how much they want civil war they want us to fight each other and we're not going to do it say amen and the reason why we won't do it is we want a life we care right god cares about every person i had an opportunity to minister to people and god's going to touch vietnam just let you know right now he's going to take that and shift that country he's shifting that government to shape that nation and if you weren't a teenager in the 60s you don't maybe not know what that means or if you were never involved in that war that was the most senseless war in the world practically they were trapped in it too but there's been amends made between some of our older military and leaders in vietnam that did have to happen but god is going to shift that government the socialists right now but he's going to shift it you watch it because he's into shifting governments and shaping nations that's another thing he's actually using trump for because god loves business if you didn't know jesus is also ceo in heaven he has a board room he has special places for a reward for people that poured out their stuff for him on earth they get to work with him in in the head office we always say orders from headquarters they do have a headquarters and that's where jesus sits as ceo so they're all about business why would he send his son as what say a carpenter is that business yes so he sent him even paul was in business he worked in fabrics and colors and he made banners and apparel and tents i mean a lot of the fish the fishermen how about that one that was business even luke right i mean he used a lot of people in business you know why they can cross boundaries that people in ministry sometimes don't have an opportunity to cross so jesus being raised as a carpenter he sat with sinners because he had business deals with them people why did he do that he was he had carpentry he did carpentry a master carpentry he had designs in carpentry he didn't just nail wood together it was his art it was his gift he still does that in heaven he doesn't ever take your gift away so how important is business to god a lot and and really more and more you will see believers become entrepreneurs over these next 10 years more than ever before because god doesn't just talk to me about right now he usually does it in like a 10 year span or a 50 he's even talking to me in the 50 year span you're not going anywhere for a while okay don't plan to escape roll up your rapture rock stick it in the closet give it away to the next couple generations beyond you wait about 80 years and then give it to them might be closer i don't think about the rapture it's not my job we know there is one and i'm totally saying there is one but i'm not told them that isn't actually not even jesus knows so focus on now your race the one you're running right now with god that will shift and change things create new things in the earth the technology is going to be crazy if you think it's something now i still try to use my i got a new cell phone that doesn't help me much at all some things i like some things i don't i go to jen all the time what is this doing why do i have to do this where did it go so my number one thing i say to her is where did it go because i can't find it oh make it go away i either can't make it go away or when somewhere i don't know where it went and people saying well take a class god's saying you're not taking a class you're not taking the class anything that has to do with the ears you get schooled in heaven okay i get my schooling in heaven that leaves my soul free from anything else like man's head knowledge i got people that can do that for me but he literally won't even let me listen to bad conversations death dying sickness and disease you know things i've noticed about pastors i know y'all don't do this but when i get invited a lot of places and we go out to eat you know what they talk about the most the worst disease catastrophes or traumas their congregation has ever gone through and i'm like that is not conducive to a fine dining atmosphere can we talk about vacations or the different seasons on the earth are god's good plans and if these people are dead and in heaven why are you bringing it up because they're not going to come back so make sure you check out your conversation even people you don't know when you meet them give them something good when you leave them they've got something good in their soul right i think a lot of people need that they need some good news or fun news it's okay to have fun my hair does that for me right now now i know one day it'll be so normal for people to go around and more and more i see companies allowing their their employees to have highlights in their hair i've even advised them to you've got free advertising because if they go something they're going to go well what are you about what do you what do you what do you do you know free advertising they could talk about where they work and the stuff they do because i know people want it almost 99 of people like my hair except some ministers and i laugh because when they get to heaven they'll be visiting the salons herself because this is normal this is just heaven culture that's what it is it's exciting it's fun it's nice looking right so why not it's like having some really nice apparel but you wear it on your head and i recently got a letter from a child i always know it's a child because they don't spell the words right and they like to print and i know when they when they address the envelope they tried really hard to write in cursive but it was all scribbly and they scratched through some of it and rewrote and i want this has to be a child and it was like 10 questions best questions ever they never they never ask any boring anything okay it was exciting and i went and he said and please write back to me and i went well i found out that he lives in denver colorado and i'll be going there in october so i'm gonna get a hold of his parents and i'm gonna make a visit i'm gonna make a surprise visit and say hey i have your answers and i i love to talk to kids because they're never sitting there going well i don't believe that well where is that in the word oh god wouldn't want to do that i'm like no they're like i want to hear more that's exciting wow i always wondered about that you know they asked wild questions and they believe so much that what god says is true they actually believe what the bible says they don't try to change it because they don't understand that and yes i have a king james version if you ever wondered i didn't go stick at the bottom of my closet because somebody came up with something better it's one of the few bibles that actually says there's unicorns in heaven why would i get rid of that nine times in the king james bible it mentions unicorns and so somebody changed it to rhinoceros in the new translations and i can always remember two of the verses i think one is psalms 29 and one of psalms 92 there's seven other ones but for me it's easier to remember them one god talks about the power of the horn of his unicorn guess what he rise in heaven the father has a unicorn that's what he rides jesus has a horse holy spirit has one they love horses they're all over heaven it's one of the favorite creatures that he ever invented he loves the power that's in that horse the excitement you know when it says it runs into the battle it doesn't it's not afraid of the sword it's not afraid of anything and uh i think i could always see into the soul when i would look into the eyes of a horse i thought you know i can see it does say the eyes are the windows to the soul and uh so in heaven if you have one they'll talk to you but the father actually has a unicorn this amazing unicorn that he rides and he talks about in the bible and people thought i think these people who were trying to interpret i think they dismissed that completely because i don't think there's unicorns in here you tell children that yes i know i have one and i'm gonna name it right now that's why you must be like little to enter into the kingdom of that's why i like to talk to children and people go oh no they'll they i i tell them if they're five and up five not bring them in and some of the four-year-olds okay set them on the front rows because they already had those robes planned for other people [Laughter] and they went oh they won't listen oh yes they will and i talked to them for two hours and all they do is giggle and say yes and they were excited and their teachers are like they haven't moved out of their chair because they found that god is exciting and filled with adventure say adventure the greatest adventures you will ever have aren't on this earth they're in heaven and then after heaven you don't just have one world to do things with when he makes the new heavens and the new earth you visit planets for fun say amen why not he's god right you know right now you live in heaven when you pass your body sleeping but your spirit and your soul are there in heaven and you get to see amazing things and step through doorways like you're in the middle of the cosmos uh you just step through this big opening it's called the observatory in heaven it's got these ancient like big stones and you step off you don't see it when you're standing there but when you step off out into nothing you're literally in the cosmos looking at it so why wouldn't he make fun planets for us to enjoy our lives on when all this stuff is over and time is no more you won't be bound by time right or space which means you can have more than one thing in the same space that might be too much for your mind we have the most amazing future as believers than anyone in this world and when i talk to them about jesus i talk about that stuff not just yes of course i talk about uh actually explaining in detail more about his crucifixion but he actually died in the garden first i know they talk a lot about the cross they should talk more about the garden and when i saw that cup or that bowl where is it right here it rocked me because that cup he drank out of if that had a stemware it would look just like that it's empty they have it in heaven although now i don't know if you know this but god hand picked the two angels that would bring that cup to him in the garden that he had to drink there was every evil wickedness every sin every disease every act of violence everything that was evil was in that cup he died when he drank it because he said not my will didn't he say let it pass from me they need to talk more about that cup so he was already dead to himself and he had to be dead to himself when he went to the cross the cross wasn't that hard for him it was taking that cup and that perfect holy being had to take all of it and let me tell you i saw that cup and if i was christ i probably would have said the same thing but you know he was alone in the garden except when those two angels came and one of the movies i'm doing stuff for you actually see in heaven when the father picks those angels gives them their assignment and you see him making this cup and putting all that in it because it's a spiritual cup and they brought it to him in the garden and then when he drank it they comforted him they were doing it before he had to drink it because they were there to support him knowing what they were bringing you'll know what they were thinking all the way down to earth with that cup it was very significant that's why it's significant to die to yourself christ did his greatest things after he died to himself and although i don't die to go to heaven i die every day so i can reveal it because i can't have myself in any of i this to die to myself i do all the time and he takes me all the time and i know a lot of stuff that goes on in heaven i know a lot about the spirit realm i know after over 20 years of going being taken there and being taken back to the past and into the future i do know a lot and so i i tweak myself i won't allow anything in my soul that is against god i won't keep one word spoken in my presence or one word or one image i saw on the tv or anywhere else i get it out of my soul i can't have it i'm not going to have a mix can i want god and only god and i want his will his way not mine i told people it doesn't hurt when people say stuff because i'm not there he is and this is his plan and he wants us to know him like that you have such creativity in you beyond what you could imagine or anyone on this earth could think or imagine we were meant to be creators say creator why because he's a creator correct and just getting simple revelation on some of the scriptures it'll change you forever to understand that when he took moses and hid him in the cleft of the rock that was inside himself he took moses and put him inside him and showed him all of time that had passed before that moment that he met him moses saw him creating the heavens and the earth moses saw the ice age that happened moses saw the earth split in pieces and separate so it wasn't just one land mass anymore moses saw all of that he couldn't share with people so that scripture that says he hit him in the clefts of the rock and as i pass by i will show you my hinder parts he wasn't saying i'm going to show you my back i will show you all the time that is behind us what an amazing mystery of revelation that god would do this with a human being and even jesus john was so close to him it's no wonder he didn't die until he decided he wanted to he could have been here now he was homesick right how many other of the disciples knew that his name was the word how many other disciples knew that he was with god and was god john knew because of his relationship how much he loved him how much he was with him and he began to desire him more than anything that's when god shows you mysteries and john saw mysteries no wonder he showed him some of the end times in the future he took him to heaven and showed him great details in heaven and even in time the other people couldn't even think they didn't want to read revelation because they don't understand it if you get revelation a lot you can understand everything that was said in that book but god wants us to search things out but the way you get them is by searching him out him first you can run after everything you want to but you better be running after him first because john was a different person john used to fight with his brother in the streets of girls the sons of thunder that wasn't their anointing that was how they acted and their mama of course who was their manager and how much he changed him so much so that he entrusted his mother to him and he was saying to his mother i'm no longer your son i am your savior so many things had to happen in order for christ to be that person for everybody you know and you will so enjoy being with him in heaven but i think because of the time that we're in and especially your children and your grandchildren will have such powerful relationships it would be nothing for them to step through a portal and go somewhere in the spirit realm and come back they'll be shaking things they're the ones who will speak to the mountain and make it jump into the sea and they go oh i changed my mind i'll put it back and it will be like breathing because sharing revelation is like breathing to me i don't have to have notes you never forget those things that you have with him or do with him that he shows you or takes you to places and yet people are so closed in a box no god can't do that with anybody you know he's too important and we're too lowly and i want you don't even know who you are we can't manifest his power if we don't actually believe he wants us to and then they don't want to talk about scriptures like god said command ye me and it freaks them out someone's going to probably change that eventually in the bible i don't like it we shouldn't say that well god said he was saying command he actually if you learn in some of the scriptures like he said if you flip it that's what i'm saying like me i say command not command you tell me what to do you command jesus christ was a commander the father was a commander holy spirit is a commander we're made in their image and after the way they operate their likeness is how they operate they're not talking about what they look like twice let us make man in our image what they look like and after our likeness is how they operate well how do they operate say without measure say without measure in the time in the bible measures were given for certain things but the closer we get to operating and ruling and reigning with christ some people will do things without measure why would he say we were kings those are spiritual kings male or female kings in the spirit there is no male nor female people think you don't look like that you don't look like a male or female in heaven it's not talking about heaven that means in the spirit where our authority and dominion is there is no difference in authority for a male or a female that's what that means he doesn't say only the men are kings and priests into their god we are kings and priests unto our god those are levels of authority and dominion occupied shall i come meant you take dominion until i come not sit on your rapture rug he never says go hide somewhere and wait till i come back we're supposed to be actively taking dominion and you have absolute right to do that as a believer don't wait for satan to come and bash you bash him jesus was never kind to any demons he never put up with them it hurt them to be near him we should live in this earth to a point where demons are terrified and they all run because they actually hurt it hurts them and pierces them to be around us because of the light and the glory of god coming from us that's how we're supposed to live and i've heard people give all different versions of that like we're so far above everybody we should just ignore the devil completely it doesn't say to do that either jesus didn't ignore him he said what he wanted to do then he went and tore him up in hell god doesn't uh tolerate their government heaven does not tolerate evil comes kick them out unseat them strip away their power and they're out amen we should be running our country like that if you want to help bring hope a people for everybody no matter who they are because god loves us all god can't abide evil but if he didn't love us he would have never sent his son he has hope for everybody i will not everybody's going to go to heaven but there'll be a lot more in heaven than you think there will be amen and children have the most delightful time but i'm happy about children on the earth they will see and experience things we never have even the way they live and how fun becomes a necessity to plan for we plan our business week we plan a a vacation maybe once maybe twice a year right we we have wedding plans you make funeral plans you make all kinds of plans estate planning planning planning how about fun planning because a happy person makes you a happy witness don't be so serious about things that you can't laugh because for years and i lived in those years where you weren't even allowed to make things look like they were funny especially in the church and then the laughter hit wasn't that funny [Laughter] rodney howard brown bushwhacked everybody god used him i was there when they came in they get stuck to the wall and couldn't stop laughing okay climbing under the chairs not being you know proper that was god's order happy disorder so i know things are going on i don't ignore what's going on i just say things to make it change you know i take authority over darkness anywhere i don't have to be by the darkness i'm not tolerating i am not tolerating it not in my body not in my home not in my city i intend to make florida a region of light i live here i'm not tolerating evil here no i bash the witches all i can because there's a lot here if you didn't know that we're right near some right now they're probably screaming there are people who need to be free i'm talking about not the people who practice it i'm talking about these spirits who deceive them and trap them into that lifestyle and sometimes it's generational they need to be free but wherever satan controls what do we do no you shouldn't be bored at all in your life if you ever watch the news you got a ministry right there [Music] you make assignments for the for the army send them everywhere you see stuff's going on if i hear about it they're gone i'm up all night long up at 20 hours anyway ask my husband i'm out in the middle of the street at 3 a.m with my staff and i have five different ones and i use them for different things get a staff where to get one any place that has things about hiking we'll sell just a simple staff god used him in the bible people used him in the bible they can carry the glory they can carry the fire they can carry your anointing that god gave you when you hit it it causes like a shock wave that comes out of there and goes through it penetrates everything in your neighborhood people either move or they like me it only begins by becoming a believer after that you pursue things seek ye first what do you seek what do you pursue seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness sake and all these things all the things you actually need to live will be added to you if you live that way that's exactly how your life will be you don't hear me asking people for stuff to go do things right i just obey him i pursue what he wants whatever he whatever he says is priority and he'll change something in the middle of my day jen knows that too my baby sister knows that he'll change your nice little schedule you'll got and you think it's messed up it's not it's just been made perfect you'd miss divine appointments divine encounters i mean i i do agree we have to have some kind of regulated life especially if you're raising a family but don't leave the encounters and experiences and the joy of god out of their lives let them look forward to that stuff let them expect it i was visiting my family in texas and my grandson had an encounter with the living god in his room so everybody else was asleep i guess guess who not he runs out of his room his eyes are this big i heard god speak i heard him i heard him he's eight he ought he knows everything i do he's all excited he's been taking trips to heaven since he was three so it's generational i'm gonna make sure that keeps going he kind of as i said i heard the voice of god i heard him speak i heard him i heard him well at his birth he almost died the devil wanted to take him out because he's a prophet and he can see that even on children that they are so he's strong very creative even at three he would say things you would be shocked at what he would say and he was running out and i said i hear i heard the voice of god said well what did he say he said he said to me i saved your life for a purpose and now that purpose will be fulfilled i said that was god he didn't need me to tell him that he already knew he was just sharing it so i wrote it down for him and gave it to him so he could share his parents were beside himself because they feeling full of god jesus holy spirit this kid can't ever go to public school he'd be baptizing people in the water fountain or in the bathroom in the sink he will pray for any sick person and he casts out devils i knew they'd never been he'd be in so much trouble they'd be calling all the time down to the school for something like but they're all like that he's the oldest and they all know who god is and they experience him that's how we're supposed to pass it to the next generation don't keep it for just you and if they aren't willing find the next one down the line somewhere you know god actually picked my sister to be mentored by me and she probably thought that was for a couple years that was a long time ago and she didn't want to at the time he says i'm giving her to you for a season it's been a long season because she's number 15 she's a caboose and god wants her to be as filled with him as i am and then let her discover stuff on her own with him and she's writing books for the children in the world about heaven [Applause] but what she sees and knows is truth is what she will be putting in those books but they won't be normal if you've ever looked up a children's book about dying well it's like a new leaf then here's the old one and that dead shriveled leaf is supposed to be what happens to the person that ain't going to happen in these books we don't hide god we wear him we walk with him and we speak for him and people know they have encountered god they've heard things they've never heard before their mind can't be the same because it's in their soul and they don't know how to take it out now we all know here how many people know how to do a soul checkup let me see your hands we will do them before we leave i do them every day yeah i've even seen yeah god calls me his soul doctor and i literally was taken in the future and i saw and i was walking down the hallways of some churches then into a big business building and they had a little plaque outside that said soul knocked on the door that means these people will know and understand how with god you can lose stuff out of everyone's soul and it will be gone like it was never there instead of going for six weeks of psychiatric treatment even if it was a trauma you had 40 years ago when you saw something it will be a race like it was never there because god doesn't have time for us to wait six weeks six months six years to be whole he wants you whole and not just whole that's divine health say divine health is being whole that's not sick and healed sick and healed sick and healed sick and healed sick and healed or just live with divine health even as your soul prospers you will prosper and live in health that's where it is in the bible so revelation one revelation he gave me changed me forever my family who does it forever and there are people who out there who do it as a lifestyle you don't keep anything in your soul that doesn't belong there no traumas no anger no offense no unforgiveness no fear no addictions no you don't have to have any of it why does he say guard your soul that means you're in charge of it you decide what you watch what you say what you hear it all goes in here and it gets stored like in files even phone numbers if you can't find it say god lose it from my soul bring it out i've done it i'm not kidding i could not find this little scrap of paper it was a pastor who had invited me in some other state and i couldn't find it i looked everywhere everywhere everywhere and finally i sat at my desk and said i need it now and i saw coming out of my soul this little piece of paper it came out and went like this so i could see it and holders just spirit said why don't you write it down right now i got my piece of paper wrote it all down and it goes those things you're looking for that you saw are needed to remember ask ask and you shall it's not impossible so all those things that you saw or heard things that you need to remember don't lose that from your soul but but being so free you walk free [Music] every day all the time of anything of the enemy even if you live in the hardest place you've ever lived in your life you can be happy and you can be powerful the more you dwell and think and meditate on stuff it grows in layers in your soul you don't want to do that if it's not something good if you're going through a trauma maybe you got hurt or wounded or somebody died and you're grieving so bad you can't get rid of it loose the grief from your soul it will go and it will be like it wasn't there you'll still miss the person you'll remember them but that grief that pierces you don't want a spirit of grief to attach itself and the devil will just beat you up with that if your kids get bullied at school don't let them just try to continue in their life because guess what they're going to remember it all the time because it was in their soul it happened to them lay your hand on their head as the watcher of my child's soul i command and i choose to lose from their soul that whole event that happened when they were bullied the words the actions the accusations i lose it right now in jesus name and heaven will come down and pull it out of them and it'll be like it never happened i have testimonies of mothers and fathers who have done that and their child goes along happy like it never happened to them instead of messing them up for 20 years and that thing is still in them don't let it stay there and then after you bind and i choose as a watch over this to bind the love of god the life of god the presence of god the joy of the lord i bind that to their soul in jesus name then they've had some of god and no one can take it out of them then they're really happy they're really excited they can be creative it is it is an awesome thing to stand before god and he will say to you what did you do with your family and this time we don't have any excuse for letting things continue in their lives and aren't good or that happen to them get rid of it amen it's called a soul checkup it is the keys to the kingdom and the father visited me one time for four hours earth time and taught me in great detail how to have people lose stuff from their soul and then to bind god to it and when i grew up it was always binding the devil if you want to keep mine and find him that makes you happy behind him instead stick the host of heaven on crush his plans pull down the strongholds and kick them out that's more effective we lose the stuff that we don't want in there what you loose on earth by your declarations will be loosed from heaven which you bind on earth the things of god the plans of god his will his way his promises his joy his celebration his expectation you bind that and put that in your soul that's how you will be and then guess what your soul will begin to prosper and guess what you will begin to prosper no matter what situation you're in financially emotionally physically you change it by using the keys to the kingdom they were that important it has to do with the kingdom it is so valuable it's worth everything you have to have that it might require you to tweak your flesh or to change the way you live by what you say and what you do there's always surrender right some people tell me you're controlling me i'm not telling you to do anything i'm sharing what he said you know you surrender with the devil its control but with god is called surrender lay down your life and find it in him right take up your cross daily why to crucify your flesh some people don't even want to use the symbol of the cross anymore that's oh we don't need to be talking about that when that happens to be his carpenter's mark that he uses in heaven don't tell jesus christ you don't want to talk about the cross you didn't die besides to him it wasn't a horrible thing it was a beautiful thing because look what he got for it he got us amen i think we just need a school of revelation somewhere i won't be running schools i don't have time although jeff jensen forgot i said that and says i'm part of the senior school of the prophets and we do have meetings sometimes about people who are seers or want to understand that more you're born to be a seer normally you have it from the time you're little but sometimes god does give you that extra gift it's a gift but people have it when they're born because the other side uses it too and there are people who do other things under satan's power and some don't even know that they're doing it under satan's power because they know they have these gifts but they see the wrong things and the guides tell them the wrong things that they're seeing but but satan can't give a seer gift he can use it or abuse it but god does give it and he's going to give it a lot more in this time amen but i don't want y'all to leave think i don't want you to leave the way you were when you came here i don't want anyone to leave the same okay when you encounter heaven it should change you every single time and yes pursue it pursue to see heaven before you die and your body sleeps i mean 50 years ago if you go and said something that let's take around time feather or go get the tar i'll get the feathers you know you can't i couldn't have been born 50 years ago or 60 or 70. i was born 50 years ago i forget how old i am but you wouldn't be running around in a pulpit and saying that but now people have gone bizarre on both hands they've gone extreme in the god's way and extreme in the weird flesh way you need to know the difference but children especially should be so acquainted with the presence of god and who they are in him and the expectancy has for them as they grow they already have greatness in them he's just going to bring it out most children born now are to be great for god even if you don't know their gift which should be pretty apparent through a drummer they're drumming on everything they're a drummer if they never stop till it irritates you they do it in public when you don't want them to but they have such passion they're a drummer get them some drums it's not that hard to identify but it's something that's very important raise up a child and the way i made them to be in the bent which means their gift raise them up in the gift i made them to be and they will never depart from it and people say that differently now raise up your child in the admonition of the lord is to know the lord to follow his ways and to know him but raise up a child in the way i made them to be is it talking about the gift the natural gift he gave them identify it make sure they get to use it and they will never want to be somebody else does that make sense to you and god said people sit on the pew every sunday trying to figure out what their child's spiritual gift is but they ignore the physical gift they ignore the natural gift and yet that's who he sent them as that like his son was sent to be a carpenter from the time he sent him he was a carpenter he just not happened to put him with joseph he on purpose put him to be with a master carpenter because of the gift he put in his son so make sure you're identifying even if it's years later you should have already understood why do they like this why do they want to do that why do they want to go there all the time and if they connect with and understand to encourage them some may be doing something it's their gift it's not with god pray that god gets them turns them onto his path that's hot that's cold hot cold i rather you hot or cold and not lukewarm you know what that is rather than be hot that means you know your gift you're using it for him you're hot over here as you know your gift you're using it but don't know him that's cold all he has to do is turn them and they're hot lukewarm i don't care what it is i have no desire to use it i'm just over it you know why he says that because he can't use you in his plans the plans he has you i'll spew out of my mouth doesn't mean you're going to go to hell it means he can't use you in the way he wants to so hot or cold if your kid is using their gift you need to celebrate right and just pray holy ghost go get them turn them put people across their path that their eyes be open that they understand yes that's who god made you but you need to do it for him so we we we come sometimes wanting you know of course i'm waiting for the day when you step in and the fire sweeps over everybody [Laughter] and you walk around and you look like burning infernos okay that's gonna happen anyway it's a time thing it is a time thing it's on his timeline it's on his timeline or i wouldn't be talking about it's on his timeline baptism and fire is already been sent it's waiting for the day it shows up in the phoneless hope buildings will be consumed with the fire i saw them spiritual fire but even will be open to the natural eye and that has happened a few times in the past where people called the fire department because the building was on fire because people were in there experiencing it and they called the fire department they couldn't find out what was burning they saw nothing burnt but the fire was there so you one day will walk around with the fire that's in you being seen on you that's we're working on our 2021 calendar it's called the fire in the glory and you will get absolute detailed revelation on each one where it is see an image of it you will actually know what it looks like so that's what we're working it's all by revelation and it will shift people so quickly when they look at that and realize this is for us i'm alive i'm breathing now it is for us amen the knowledge of the glory you know thus the knowing and understanding of the glory of god covering the earth it's you taking it that's not the glory just being dropped on everybody it's you carrying it you taking the glory that comes out in shock waves and you can hear it and people get consumed and they're gone just they're either taken into the spirit realm literally i'm not kidding they may be gone and disappear for a while and come back they may be knocked out and not be there but taken somewhere in their spirit when the glory begins to come from you it will be so devastating to the enemy and if you go into walmart and do it all the people in walmart will be hit with it you can't you can't hide people can't hide or try to escape from some of these things that god is going to do and that calendar will talk about all of it and that's god's best way for me that he uses me is to take a calendar and either release something make you aware of it show you exactly what it looks like because an image is worth a thousand words and he works with me with images all the time so the first one on the host of heaven the army of heaven that was our first calendar the second one was all about heaven we have a few out there on that table and you see places in heaven that literally exist exactly how it looks what happens there it gives you a greater understanding and revelation on heaven but the wonder the fire and glory is going to be very powerful because these are things that we will all experience and do is things you will do you'll even know what to do with it so this is how god that's why he gave his word he put it in writing in his word in writing so you would have great understanding of him and the things that have happened the things that are coming but when you add an image it changes everything then you know this is supposed to happen this is what i need to run after my friend got baptized in fire and i wanted it and i was already pursuing jesus but i kept asking i want that fire i see that fire their change is so bold i want it i want it and i finally got a measure knocked me slap out into the congregation three or four rows back my body vibrated for eight hours they locked me in the church i wasn't in my body two angels came and carried me back in time and set me on the ground outside the tomb of christ literally in that time wasn't a vision i was in that time when the stone had been rolled away so you can expect when these things you've been waiting so long for it will be worth it some things we can get measures of but what he's talking about is an encounter you will never forget and people won't have to ask you have you received baptism and fire because you won't be the same you will become bold the fire makes you bold like in the book of acts when the people in the upper room they got a measure so that it was on top of them okay they were hiding right say they were hiding they didn't hide no more after that they went out in the streets won three thousand people in that day they boldly proclaimed it takes all of fear fear can't even come back in you it burns things off the wall of your heart like they were never there and instead god writes on the wall of your heart that's what baptism in fire is and you'll feel the heat like you never thought before it is we're in his time it's not for 20 years down the road so why should we be filled with fear we look around and see what man is doing or what man is saying or christians who don't have a clue so what happens is when they don't understand his time to go to the end of the bible and that's actually what's happening even with pastors well i don't know what any of this means so it looks like it's wrapping up now the antichrist must be around the corner so get ready to get taken out of here and i'm like that is not what's happening he's setting up a platform right now for us to demonstrate his power the manifested sons and daughters [Applause] and he has to have a place our country what we have total freedom to operate amen and that's why he says 24 years in the white house that doesn't mean he won't still be in the white house that means it will be so changed by the end of that 24 years it won't look or sound like the same country people will want to have friends they will want to have christians as their friends they will seek out christians on purpose to know as friends they'll want to know why are your children excelling above all the rest of the school and it will be jesus christ so god has to have this time why would he take away some of the best times on the earth if he said we would do those things why would he sit up there on the throne saying oh i'm changing my mind it's just getting too tough no he knows exactly what he wants amen you just have to be born i wouldn't say the perfect time i would say you're here because of god's time he timed your birth on the earth you are not a mistake however that birth happened you came from him your spirit man came from him we can't make a spirit we can make bodies by the way god designed us right but you can't make a spirit even the word made a body called adam was there any life in it no remember it says go back and read genesis when he made adam's body it was there was no life no life until the father who carries the spirit of life that's your spiritual body leaned over and breathed into adam's nostrils that spirit of life that was his spiritual body he breathed into him and then he became a living soul when does life begin at conception down here at conception god sends a little spirit of life from him by the holy spirit he goes into that little dot of flesh and knits and attaches it so it doesn't go back to heaven and it can't leave he literally knits i knit you together in your mother's room doesn't mean oh i put your arms and legs on i knit you that was you that was your spiritual being that was you who lived in god and he sent you to this earth on the time he needed you to be here your children are very key to be here right now and he picked you to bring them here he needs us to bring them that's why he doesn't like it when it's stopped he doesn't like it because he had plans for that child amen he knows what he's doing isn't it amazing he picked you to raise children well he trusted my mom by giving her 15 [Laughter] sometimes life isn't easy he doesn't promise that it will always be easy but he promises according to his words we will always have authority we will always have dominion we will always have creativity to make food or multiply the food to stop the storms if we have to to walk on water these are his promises even in the days we're in he didn't take those promises away we need to believe them you pray you believe he heard you you believe that's going to happen your faith is what draws that he gives it to us but he has to see it active in your life and this is something he taught me he said your will that you want something has to like your actions must line up with what your will has asked for they have to match when they match something is created stand up even if you've done this before i want you to do anyway we're going to take about three minutes to change our life god doesn't take forever working with us sometimes may take forever right because he needs our agreement he needs our participation not our frustration he needs participation not frustration you need to remember that okay because sometimes what he gets is frustration because it's still you know we're frustrated we're we get so frustrated and aggravated we almost forget everything he said because the enemy's using the frustration aggravation right to get us away from what his focus is or what his purpose is don't let it ever happen again because you can't create when you're sad or mad that's why they hide artists they hide athletes they hire they hire hide uh people who have these wonderful gifts they hide them until they perform because otherwise they don't even realize it's their soul but they think well their mind can be corrupted or it could be crushed their emotions could be a mess and then they won't be able to do what they were being paid to do or they wouldn't do so if all of those people knew about losing that junk from their soul they would be free amen so let's look up to heaven and say father i am your child i have received your son that means i can have a soul checkup for free so i'm going to do that right now i choose with my will to lose from my soul i want you to go like this when we lose it all aggravation of frustration all sadness all lack all anger all offense all addictions all angry words whether i heard them or i spoke them i lose any crushing any trauma i don't want it in my soul i lose anything being spoken against me or over me that was not you i'm not keeping it in jesus name i lose from my soul all sickness any attacks of the enemy physically mentally or emotionally i'm cleaning house right now in jesus name now we're gonna wait a minute while he pulls stuff out the holy spirit loves this now we're gonna bind god you can do this all day because if people walk up and they say horrible things you walk away trust me i know all about this you feel bad the words don't go away you keep hearing them over and over again in your head by the time you get home you're so upset you can't you can't help your kids you don't want to talk to your spouse you're now consumed by this and yet you can have it gone in 10 seconds literally when someone says something to me even in front of them sometimes they'll go excuse me i choose as an act of my will to lose all those horrible mean hateful words that were just spoken to me i'm not keeping them in my soul in any way in jesus name and they're gone and i don't stop and god i choose now to bind to my soul your life your words your promises your presence your joy and i am so happy when i turn back around the person's like and i look at him go well how are your day going how's your day are you having a good time because i'm not the person filled with all that junk that they just planted in me and i make it very obvious i'm not taking it anymore that's a lifestyle say a lifestyle it's not a one-time thing say i breathe every day i eat every day i sleep every day i'm doing a soul checkup every day it's called heaven culture so are you ready i choose as an act of my will to bind to my soul these will come in waves the love of god the life of god the presence of god the plans of god his expectation his celebration his validation those i bind in jesus name amen [Applause] sit down now you really are different because you let stuff go you hear people all the time just let it go let it go but they don't know how to tell you to do that right it'll pass it'll be all right eventually you know in a few months you might get over it maybe a year just let it go but if it's in your soul it's in your mind if it's in your soul it's in your emotions if it's in your soul it's in your will and the way god made you is to run after his stuff and the more you get the more you want and if it's in you you will pursue it you will choose it and when you keep choosing it you will manifest it in your emotions because that's the layers of your soul that's you that's who you are and people go what happened to you i just actually started living right that's what i did i decided to live on earth like they live in heaven because no one has any issues in their salt they still have their soul their soul doesn't sleep that makes me laugh and they say soul sleep you couldn't choose what you're going to eat in heaven you couldn't choose where you were going to go you were going to go visit your soul is your mind your will what you choose and your emotions what you just you'd be up there doing nothing so your soul doesn't sleep the flesh sleeps your spirit man your soul's in the very core of it it goes with you okay it goes with you so in heaven they don't have any of that stuff going on you already you're filled your soul still gets filled all the time it learns how to create in heaven i mean really create not people say thank you jesus we will never create a race of people and have to be god to them say amen he already did that we don't have to do that but your creativity explodes in heaven but we're in a long season on the earth of creativity and if you get ideas make sure your soul is free of any junk because whatever is in you will go into that creativity and the enemy he knows that that's why people with gifts amazing gifts create darkness they're really good at making movies but they're dark because guess what their soul is and that comes out in the then the movie and the creativity they create apparel they have a great gift for it but the images they put on there or the styles i use are not very nice because their soul is dark that's how that's why it's so important to understand how powerful it is to know what you were taught tonight if you create whether it's music or yummy food i like i like to i like um sweets jen knows that i like movies really good powerful decent movies say decent heaven has movies they don't need ratings they they say what the ratings if it's ours rotten don't see it the first trip to heaven they took me to they took me to a movie theater how about that people always say when did you first go on don't ask me that if you're already trying to let people understand how amazing heaven is best shifted or baptist you don't want to tell them well they took me to the movie theaters and writing you off my list pink hair was enough now you've gone over the edge now i wrote a roller coaster ah piper take you off the list we'll scratch you off right now so when they always i said well how about if i tell you after i've been there a couple times how about we do it well for the very first time i was caught up until the movie theaters in heaven which were fantastic they didn't they didn't have no ratings they had fun adventurous intense exciting powerful i'm not kidding they were the most exciting amazing i was actually showing like three different movies yes you still have popcorn you sit in these chairs that conform to your body there's a waterfall at the end when it disappears it's the screen the walls are alive so the light will be the way it needs to be to see the movie but you go down the other hallway and go in a different door and you're in the movie you're one of the people starring in the movie so it's a little different you sit in this chair and it conforms to you like i'm gonna see you forever comfort i always hear comfort there it wraps itself around you could sit on a rock and be comfortable but you see these amazing amazing seats with all the amazing designs right everybody's excited because usually they've been invited to see their friend be in a movie you're coming to watch their debut and it's captured i don't know how to explain to you anymore is captured not filmed it's captured and sent to that screen you're watching and so at that moment you're seeing them actually do it it's not something that was done beforehand and they could be in one with john wayne yes he still makes movies that was his gift okay and but you sit there and this clear transparent menu appears you push what you want and then like that it's on a tray in front of you popcorn you think they have movies without popcorn i think the angels like it but anyway it's okay to laugh remember and then i was taken to the place they were capturing the movies that was cool how i saw them make they kind of whatever the people were there doing it in the scene it was created it wasn't on a backdrop with a green screen there's no green screens they actually do the action themselves and it's being created as they're doing it with them in it taken and transported back on that screen so you see your family then you all go out and eat afterwards and talk about your debut god loves he loves the arts he loves the arts okay but he wants them to be decent and god said kept tell me pray for hollywood he said they what they're putting out is dark because their soul is dark and that's how i that was before he told me about loosing or binding to my soul what's in them is what they're putting in the movies so make sure you know who made that movie that you're going to go watch and if it's someone who's dividing don't watch it because that spirit of them that's in them will be in the movie they just made the more understanding even the world will begin to understand about the soul and will we still respond i don't know about the body of christ but they'll even have soul doctors for people and guess what even the people in the world can lose from their soul it's the way he made them they'll still have to say in jesus name because it ain't going to happen it's basically this truth because people say that can't be true well jesus healed people that weren't believers and they didn't say come here i want to be a believer did they they reached out to him [Music] as their healer they had faith he could heal they knew that he was he would say he was the son of god that he was a messiah when they went to him and said i i'm i'm believing you for healing they were reaching out to know him as their savior because he would heal them and then he would say now go and sin no more did he say that that's another shock for you isn't it so when you reach out there's people who get saved that you'll never know about until you get to heaven because they still reached out to jesus christ for who he was for what they desperately needed in that moment they didn't get a piece of him they got a hold of him it was their cry it was their hunger for that and they got both or he would not have said that to them and your sins are forgiven because they acknowledged who was believe on the lord jesus christ and you shall be you're not going to get to heaven without him but people who reach out for out of desperation for what they need are recognizing who he was or he would not have said to them you are now healed be healed and now your sins are forgiven but you never saw in the world where they wrote down and said forgive me of my sins it was in that cry and that hunger of recognizing believe who he is correct we we need to understand if they were still using faith even when they didn't have it they were reaching to him for that and he said and now your sins are forgiven isn't that powerful that should give everybody hope about your family members that's why we as representatives of heaven the way we live and act will draw people to that light but we've always been told don't show who you are don't let yourself be seen you know you don't want people to be drawn to you but if we have christ that's why he's drawing you we will have many christian celebrities in this time and they will be called christian celebrities do you know what the holy spirit told me the word celebrity means to celebrate it doesn't say worship it depends on where people carry that but in this day we will stand up and stand out on purpose because he wants us to or they won't know who he is it's a new way he's sending us really he is sending us for that purpose to be and he's told me in person you will be a christian celebrity you'll get bashed a lot for it but don't listen to any of them because you will bring many into the kingdom because of what you do what i have you do i'll be totally involved in hollywood which god is taking that throne away from satan he's taking it away [Applause] the arts belong to god they started in heaven and one of the platforms he gave me was arts and entertainment and entertainment family fun entertainment why he wants us to laugh and enjoy our life and what a message to give in or you know right next to orlando right a place of supposed to be of course harry potter world's coming down [Laughter] that's an that's a news bulletin from heaven if you have the books burn them loose it from your soul it's not a joke news from heaven witchcraft is not a joke and it is not a fantasy it's not a fantasy and we've been blinded to believe that there's good witchcraft there are no good witches even if they don't know it there is no good god speaks against him doesn't he in the bible another word for witchcraft is necromancer have nothing how clear can you be have nothing to do with the necromancer the dark arts the black arts was introduced by the angels the the watcher angels who fell created offspring in the land and then were worshiped as gods those angels were they introduced human sacrifice they introduced the black arts that's how they got here they're bound in chains they're not on the earth right now i don't think you have a nephilim showing up at your back door so there's things we have to consider and understand when we have understanding that keeps us safe from the enemy deceiving us don't believe a lie because it will consume you and you won't know you'll be blinded from the fact that you were lied to deception is something satan likes to use because it doesn't cost him much he just people walk around don't know what's going on what time it is that they're looking for answers and people who look very entertaining or they have sounds right what they're saying but you don't know people by their gift your gifts are important but you don't know them you don't know of them as a person you will know them by their fruit what that means is what are they producing whether it's in the movies in music and entertainment going on those people who are making that what does their life look like are they totally into darkness are they against life or light if all they want to do is deceive those people are not people to follow or to watch or to have their stuff in your home okay you want god's stuff things that are a lot filled with life joy happiness celebration those are okay but you can't attach something because there is something attached things can attach to all kinds of stuff i'm not putting fear in you i'm just letting you understand if it looks like smells like reed's lie sounds like witchcraft don't have anything to do with it because it is controlled with the big c and we've been duped into thinking it's okay because it's fun it's exciting it's romantic it don't matter vampires are vampires those are real in the spirit realm don't watch that stuff it represents d-e-a-t-h i don't care how amazing and beautiful it looks it still represents death amen so i'm well schooled in heaven about all of the i always knew that stuff was junk because my dad told me it was he never wanted to celebrate halloween one day when we get big enough as one quest we will have festivals of light on october 31st everywhere in this country and it will have one bit of darkness in it because that day does not belong to the enemy every day belongs to us as the body of christ [Applause] amen so i have a couple other things i could share uh well you've heard the most important thing god want me to say is trump will win make sure you vote for him amen he needs our votes but i promise you the god of heaven and earth is absolutely saying i've had people call and say would you repeat that uh would you repeat that publicly i absolutely will repeat it i will be making a trip to capitol hill probably about a week before the elections and i will be standing in front of capitol hill being filmed and taped for what god has to say about that election okay and i will be talking about also to make it worse for some people i would definitely talk about the next 20 years of god in the white house [Applause] because he's going to do it [Applause] and even people who didn't want any of this will be blessed by it because they'll be living with what god wants done amen he wants america to not be about the the american dream he wants to be known for the god of america and that's he wants people to come here to find him amen so you have exciting lives i want to take a couple questions does anyone have a question that's burning in you that i haven't answered what is your question oh she said what about the economy absolutely yes the economy will be accelerated it actually will have we will have more jobs than he had created in his first four years already because he has had to live through this mess too and he understands through all this thing i've heard there are other things i have to change i have to change them so everybody can benefit from you know from what he's the what god's shown him to do in this country and he has sought out more christians more prayers uh more ministers than any other former president and and he continually thanks god okay so we cannot escape being blessed because the very head highest person in our land who wants god allows god invites god prays to god we remember when it says pray for those in authority because when god is of god that people rejoice you will be rejoicing over the economy over the education arena over the arts and entertainment over industry it's not going to stop amen and so absolutely if people lost jobs what you get will be better than what you ever have before he may even give you your own business because you have seen in this time a lot of people god has shown you things that are needed that weren't here before one of the things i do know that trump is going to have in place is a way to help people to complete the vision they have to bring help and hope to america amen so the one thing that will change is no masks no no mask [Applause] amen god doesn't want us to be muffled what are you going to do well we are going to enforce that you just can't do that they come and get slain in the spirit what are they going to do well they are slain in the spirit they will get up different so you have a question oh he is not ever going to force anyone to take a vaccine if they don't want that vaccine he absolutely is not espec especially with the input he's had recently about the people who are trying to create it now i will say he has some viable people who care who are trying to work on a solution but the ones that have been offered to him already he has said no [Applause] after he looked at it he said it's worse this is worse than the virus and he literally had high up at the ups bring him this formula that was actually created and made this will help everybody in america to not have this virus and he goes after he took it and studied all but he had people study it and they went you don't want this this is bad this isn't bad it'll make them worse if they take it some people may die from taking it why and so we told them i'm not taking that no that they're better off just to make it through even on their own than to take this stuff he doesn't want to us and if he hadn't listened to people that he trusted and a person in his place who only thinks good and he wants to help right he wants to build up he wants to help us to be better there's nothing that's been done that he intentionally did to hurt us it was people who were lying to him that were fired he fired the world health organization flat out fired him [Applause] said he was he wasn't taking any of their advice anymore and then there were some people in the center cdc the center for disease control he is about to fire some more [Applause] that's see when he started asking the people and not certain professionals supposed to be the best in their field and and i'm i'm always sending him stuff i send stuff to donald jr other place and i say why is your father listening to people who hate him some of these were liberals why would he believe them and they're trying to act like they're helping they still hate him and they want to destroy everything he's trying to do he does not need to listen to those people i don't care who they are i don't care what their certifications are i don't care what they have proved that they can do those people hated him before it came they are now trying to use it against him i'm sure i'm not the only one who was telling him that and so he fired a whole bunch of them i said you these people which is truth right these people who have plotted and planned against him from the beginning didn't become good overnight because oh we can now help the country that wasn't their plan they have used it they have literally used it they are hoping that we will still be all in our homes don't you love that we are in this together oh no we're not in this together i'm sure you're not doing stuff that you're telling i'm not talking about trump i'm talking about the other people who want to put that image out there we need to stay separated to protect one another you know our immune system goes down we need to be together it builds your immune i i also sent that message i also sent that message to him why don't you go check out the immune system and find out i do it very nicely find out are we good when we're together are we good when we isolate ourselves when we are together and the one thing he did find out and he did start questioning how come kids aren't getting this why are not real young people not getting it it's because they play together they play together they run together they are together but i think the worst thing that was presented to him that he actually laughed them out of the interview that we will come in your home and arrest you if you're not wearing a mask in your home you might give it to your kids that was something they wanted past i have found this out about the devil when he thinks he's one he gets sloppy and this is can be proven even in the word when satan thinks he's one by controlling people he'll do stupid things forgive me if i said that word but you know i don't know what else to call it they do very intelligent unintelligent things because they're fed they're being fed to do whatever they have to do criminal acts violence to make sure that he doesn't win because they don't want god in the white house that's the truth so whatever they can find they're selling parts of the soul to the enemy they're getting people to do to do it they're buying people to do things the thing that's not intelligent is when you pay people to do the dirty jobs and people start getting caught who will scream the loudest the minion you found and paid to do your dirty work and they know you did it that's how the dominoes are gonna fall and all these people at the top of this mess and i mean it is crazy right now in washington dc we just heard from our friend this absolutely has to be exposed and some of it is numbers and some of let me tell you they're gathering you may notice he's gathering information to get people imprisoned but people who do this because their influence the enemy doesn't care who falls he doesn't he's using them to stop something he doesn't want and he doesn't want god in this p in this country he doesn't want freedom liberty and justice of any kind in this country so he has focused himself on all this other stuff to bring all the stuff in to put fear in us or thinking the end is here that there and take hope away from people you know no matter what it costs and people have behind closed doors lied the other thing they did that was not until they made them sign documents oh these people they paid off they made them sign documents that they were willing to do this that's not smart if you're going to do something like that you don't get anybody's names on nothing you don't take pictures you don't keep records where they're doing it all what they're building god said is evidence against their self and it's already too late to try to stop it they've gone too far they can't go back it's too late to escape getting caught so i hope that answered your question i take one one more question what there is to be no second wave of the virus and they will try i will tell you that's from him that's from him when they already started talking about the second wave coming before the first one was kind of here but in the natural world when a virus comes in it's introduced it goes around and then it begins to die out because eventually with virus you build immunities against it then in the natural this happens so we would naturally begin to build immunities in our own body it's not like a second wave can't happen the only thing that could affect was maybe a few people who are infirmed or something like that that never had it before that might happen but there is no mass second wave oh in the food there they will try because this was all created the virus thing was created it was absolutely created in elaborate i can just elaborate that it was created in china in a lab it was cr it was created because china is not happy with us they're communist and they have been sucking us dry with no honor for us for america taking what they could take and god told me years ago the ones who've been stealing in the business industry in the energy industry who've been stealing from america will be brought down and will not ever be able to do that again that was probably 10 years ago he told me that those who've been doing that and using and abusing because they used us because in in toys in clothing and home accessories they put asbestos they put let on purpose in their products they were shipping here kids crayons toys and they did it on purpose and the other thing you need to know is this i know they have some beautiful things they put from that place but if you see detail like in fabrics and beautiful jewelry they pay five-year-old children to do that never has there been such a mass abuse of children as in that country and these things some people have been getting and they talk about how amazing it is children were in factories forced to do that they have no care for humanity and all they saw us is a money and they would bake companies to come over there you'll be able to sell this so cheap but the way it was put together was i've looked at designers clothes and called them and said i used to buy on the sale rack of course if i liked a designer's clothes but when they went and looked at them hugo now on all the many clearance racks our designer clothes the threads are falling apart they're not staying together the fabrics are not good because these designers are selling out or else their managers are selling out their designs to china and every one of them say china i don't buy anything i will literally look at every label whether it's food products whether it's things to make foods in whether stuff to wear i don't care i will not get it i won't buy it because i don't trust them and when it was finally discovered about the asbestos well they had to re-change their home market but then the lead was put in there and there was one other thing i can't remember what it was three major things huh what was it oh i remember when they put in the pet food and the pets were dying yeah they they'll put in anything to get money but the thing is this the name on those bags are people we trust that make stuff and i tell you the gmo stuff is not fake either you can't get you can't buy stuff this genetically modified or genetically engineered it has absolutely no nutrition and big companies that like kellogg's and nabisco and they're sending their stuff to mexico to be made or china del monte sends stuff to china and you better look at the grocery shops when you're shopping god's given me a news and media platform which this is part of what i'm sharing right now with you but we will be telling the truth and have facts to give you and it will be one of the shows that we put on our we we produce news and media we'll be sharing all these things that are harmful but what is good you need to know what is good there are manufacturers that are doing really good stuff that taste just as good annie's i know annie's has really good stuff people's but because still got to look at the label make sure it may even say uh organic make sure it set doesn't have on those on the side genetically or partially genetically engineered or genetically modified means what they're doing is they're taking the seeds and stripping away the value of them so the products can be bigger or look better but there's no nutrition in them and people we need to be educated in that too and even in the natural realm about things so make sure what you're wearing is safe and they they make furniture that says in california they make them put a label this meets the standards for asbestos in this piece of furniture that has not exceeded the limits we allow i i don't want anything with asbestos in it okay and you had your did you have your hand up one more then we got to stop because it's 10. how does israel play in the part of america what god is doing with america well i can tell you this because i already do know this that many orthodox jews will be doing business with americans i will also say this to you i don't know not maybe not so much there are jews in this country if anybody watches the fake news they're going to get corrupted they just need to people not if they don't watch it all the time not so bad but if they feed off of all that lies it can it can you know compromises the word the holy spirit said it can compromise your soul and jews in israel are wild about our precedent i know i wore this shirt on my last day i was there for 10 or 12 days i don't remember masada being reminded if i have a hard day he'll say masada because i had to climb that i was invited by steve schultz i think it was a 12-day tour and i thought you know nice hotel speak the platform he dragged me all over every day for eight hours okay and you had to catch the bus like at seven a.m i hadn't even gone to bed yet because i could have been at seven and then i wake up around 11. but they didn't haul me anywhere at night they dragged me everywhere in the daytime and i'm like i lost 15 pounds i cherry tomatoes in little rolls because i don't like kosher food i'm so sorry jesus i don't want it but they dragged me out to the bus every day and they hooked a mic on me and had a cameraman follow me and they they know i'm a seer so every place like i spoke on the sea of galilee and i commanded the fog to lift and it was gone and i went on mark carmel and told people what i saw in the spirit realm and it was all recorded about the fire that's still there the fire angels that are still there about uh you know the tomb where the two angels were inside and the people saw them they're still posted right there and he taped 18 times of taking me to all these key places in the bible to tell people what i saw in the spirit realm so he bushwhacked me because i didn't find out until i got there i have to go out in the heat and sweat and climb mountains or go underground a mile where king david's house was it was powerful seeing that stuff i'm like that's my only time unless you take me in the spirit you know thank god they had my husband come he had to haul me up everywhere okay and the camels um take mouth spray and spray it for you to talk to the camel come on that's a free tip from me okay israel is always going to be key and those are still god's chosen people they were the first people on this planet who believed for god and they still stand for that same god that we love they don't have jesus but now we had for our god who one met when wendy alec took me to israel a long time ago and did a television show with her for three days and the first time i think i taught about losing from the soul was on her on god tv so i went back and she hired a guide to take us to all the inside places where nobody got to go on tours we had a private guide and when we went on this whole bus tour all over the place that was the guy who was our guide the same one yoshi yeah he remembered me so we'd go places and he'd give his speech right head knowledge about the country of israel and then when he was done i'd get up there and speak about the spirit realm and what i knew about stuff and he's like uh he didn't know i'd be speaking i went there there they brought me to do that so well i'll just watch by the third day he could not help stay because god was speaking about his people and today how powerful they'll be in the earth what good friends they'll be with america this is not the time for their persecution yet that those days can't come right now because of these are the days of blessing and greatness and coming together right and so the persecution people are always going to hate them because the devil hey sam but god's got so many new blessings for them how about that for the first time they were recognized in the world by a leading nation that israel was uh that and then he put the capital in jerusalem when he voted for that to happen they gave us a brand new embassy in israel three times bigger i even got to see it before they actually finished it so if you were a christian and you liked trump you had five star favor and i thought i'm gonna just see what happens the holy spirit said wear your trump shirt in the jewish quarter where they don't really want people to come but you can kind of walk through it my husband would be witness they were stopping me taking their pictures with the orthodox jews with the hat that everything they wanted their picture they couldn't you know speaking who they would point at trump and they would get their camera and i go yeah sure so all over israel pictures of this pink-haired person with one of the most important people in israel because we have protected them we have helped them we have blessed them and when you bless israel you can't escape blessings and god and god had me prophesy because these orthodox jews would gather around where our meetings were all outside they were not inside in a nice ac place they would come around the border of where they were seated or where i was speaking even the ones with the big guns and they'd stay in there and listen because they could speak english and they heard me talk about what god the god of heaven and earth thought about them and what his plans were for them and they they would start to cry and they weren't invited but they came anyway so wearing this shirt was the best thing i got to do even in the airport in the israel israeli airport they were stopping me the jews were stopping to take pictures of trump and uh so yeah and um by the end of the tour that guide who was our orthodox jewish god could not wait to hear what i was going to say about these places in in israel and they claim that jesus let himself down the mount of the precipice where they were going to throw the crowds were going to throw them over but jesus walked through them he stepped in the spirit round and walked through the people but what they tell people is he put a rope down and climbed down the side of the mountain so that's what the guy said and then i got up there i said well revelation on that that could be a possibility in the natural but that's not what god was doing with his son his son had the ability the spirit realm was around us there's openings in it and when you step in you can see and hear everybody but nobody can see you and you walk through the physical buildings the physical people they can't see you they can't hear you and that's what he did he walked through the people it even says that in the bible so i pretty much gave revelation on everything it was quite an experience for me who you know my i want my mailbox on the door so i don't have to walk outside to go do it i am a 50 step a day person i think i did 50 000 steps on that trip make sure if it's a pilgrimage tour you will never be out you'll never be inside it won't be comfortable it won't be convenient but it'll be life-changing and i i think stand up because i wanted to clear over everybody

we want to welcome cat she doesn't really need an introduction I tell you what a god is her introduction and who has never heard her before raise your hand this is your first time wow that's awesome that's our 180 guys you're in for a big surprise alright let's welcome her hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you one moment I was yelling too much when you're a seer you see everything is going on there's different levels of seers is about to be a new school the Prophet started the seer school of the prophets the new Eagles that God is raising up here there's a difference in I know prophets are called Eagles also the prophets because you know we're in a new time so God's bringing new and the new will be see your prophets because it changes everything when you see what's happening you hear but you see it and this is what the Holy Spirit said in the past the seer not this year but the Prophet Eagles would fly high to see what to do what was going on but the seer prophets see before they fly they already know where to go and what's going on and I was standing over there about 20 minutes or so ago and and the Lord was outside those windows and he said my train is about to fill this temple before before they started saying it is that my train is going to fill this temple it's going to be rocked and I'm telling you angels by the hundreds and thousands began to jump in spin in slide in there was so much water I just wanted to yell it's raining I was yelled it's raining grab the rain grab the rain because they were they were just sliding in the water was coming in from everywhere it was from heaven it was water coming from heaven and they were jumping on here not just here they were actually doing that in heaven because they were celebrating what was going on here so what happened was we literally connected with heaven in the workshop and I would I would hear the Lord say things before deed he would declare it or he would sing it he was saying it so they were hearing literally in their spirit what he was saying and that's what we need to do in our services amen we should let him have his way I can hear all of heaven just yelling he is holy he is worthy we were singing that song together that was not just us that was heaven singing with us and then and then I know where they are the ones with the blue fire in their hair started coming in and spinning over people the Seraphim were coming in I probably never seemed to serve them come in anywhere and I'm sure they do because they're over the throne of God and I kept thinking why are they here why did they look up there and the throne of God was outside the window anyway and I understood I understood why they were in here literally they like loop over you and they're here their heads on fire with this holy fire and holiness was flooding this place it was going into your souls you've had so many deposits in your soul just from being here during the worship and so he gained his throne appeared to serve him actually came in and where they were just flying over top of everybody just reach up and say I take it it's mine in this time there will be so many seers he's going to open people's eyes even people who never saw before he's establishing a new level of discernment in the earth in his body the seer anointing is going to just be going everywhere because it does change things when you see it really does because you know it's accurate you know what you're seeing is act but you know that it's God moving and so we definitely in a new time and I'm telling you I've already gotten some he came and gave you some orders for this service of what to do what to declare what to call in and so we just thank you Father for honoring us Lord honoring us with your presence Holy Spirit honoring us with your presence we think heaven for showing up and showing off in here today worshiping with us having fun with us we thank you we thank you for that father this is a fun time and at the same time this is the holy time and a lot of people I know when I started speaking up some of the body had a problem seeing themselves as being fun or funny and that being holy but it's part of being holy I mean why wouldn't you have fun if you were free from any effects of the enemy or the world or man whatsoever you will have more fun than you've ever had in your life and that's why we need to be wholly conscious we need to be wholly conscious right I mean and he's also sharing with me that whole thing everyone says and they don't even know what they're saying for all have sinned and come short of the glory you need to look at what says on the second half of that where where has that sin come from because we're coming short of the glory and I know probably some people don't understand that the glory is the power of God and we on this search is supposed to belong to him we're supposed to be demonstrating that power releasing that power and we have come short of it a lot of people come sorbets because they're playing in the world they're playing in the enemy's camp and they can't even see what they're miss and they can't see who they're supposed to be and so I know people try to use it for all different reasons or you know often have sinned and come short of the glory but you can get to a place where you don't come short of the glory that you are filled with the glory yet you're the fullness of the glory because the knowledge of the glory that ploy double covers will be done by those who are filled with it who are full of it for releasing it we're imparting it and you are not coming short of the glory amen we should never come short of the glory it's what he's offered is this what he's given us to represent him in this earth and so we need to concentrate and be serious about getting all that we can get karey all that we can carry and let me tell you if there's any of any me and you you can't carry the glory okay we can't carry it because Christ when he walked this earth he had none of the enemy in him so right now we're going to stand up and I'm going to declare some things and then you're gonna yell we agree father I speak now to the body of Christ those who are running those who are fighting those who are sitting does it were blind those who are confused those who are true for the enemy I call you forth for the kingdom of darkness and in the kingdom of play it's time for you to get here stand up stand up for him let go of your shackles let go of your blinders don't be blind don't be confused don't be trapped because he will not tolerate not put up with Pharmacia ruling over people abortion ruling over people not semantics mulling over people evil ruling over his people he will cut down every weed and it will be burned up by the fire of his presence he will not tolerate it in this state in this country he is going to deal with it he's gonna deal all that is not right he going to set it right and those who call themselves as leaders that are lying they're cheating they're living sin and pouring into the congregation you have days you have weeks left to make it right with him or he will remove you from this earth he will not tolerate you saying you represent him and you walk in ungodliness and you say he is your God he will not know you if you do not change your ways you will not live to see the day of his glory on this earth so repent and come back to him if you want to live and not die [Applause] you were appointed by God to carry the glory but will their glory expose you or will you carry it because he will not tolerate you using his name and making his name something that is bad and evil yes he sees your sin and just because he doesn't say anything doesn't mean he's not going to do anything because he's saying to stay an hour you better change your ways and change your life if you want to remain on this earth because he won't let you carry the glory he won't you miss us he won't you demonstrate he will replace you and take your place from you [Applause] forgot about to walk amongst us and touch off lunch and let me tell you it will burn you and know in a good way if you don't change what you're doing you can't ride your congregation you can't pull them in a deception you can't pull them into confusion you can't pull them into sin you recruit and appointed to help set them free from the sin to speak truth to speak life because deception will be exposed and you will be in full and the phone will be great and you will lose all then you think you have built you lose all what you think you have because you will not take my name and tell you stand for me when you stand for the a me get out of the enemy's camp test your God [Applause] and over this nation I would you Claire I have come to take this nation back this nation is flowing it is not man it is not the enemies I will not tolerate the enemies of this country I will not tolerate them place fear will fall on you and you come against my land again come against my people you will not win you will never win because my son has already won for him seven points the man I chose to turn the white house and no one or nothing will unseat him I say he will resting and change things and abolish things that are wrong for just to speak in this land righteousness walks and this land and I will extend my mercy for a window of time for the enemies in this way to get out of this place or you will be exposed you'll be found out and you will be dealt with harshly says God this time is in purpose for time and celebration a time of rejoicing when justice has them released in this land I have moved my hand on this land and now I can take my hand off of it you can't move me you're not bigger than me you're not stronger than me and you were not wiser than me you are ants crawling on the ground and you're about to be crushed by the help by the way of my glory and the way of those who love me when they carry it says God I caught for those who called himself mine that are broken they're ripped they're ruined that are distraught that are suffering better in poverty in LAC those who don't really know me I call you to come and run after me run after me run after my love run after my love run after my presence because I will fill you I will heal you I will establish you I will raise you up I will set you in high places higher than you ever dreamed you could have because I'm a God who brings dreams who brings visions and then I will establish you in this hour no I have not forgotten you when I showed you 30 years ago 40 years ago this is the time I waited to establish you to put the wealth of the wicked in your hands to put you in high places to rule and reign with my son to crush the plans of darkness to push back darkness great regions of whiteboard or sin or death or crime cannot remain [Applause] stop running after false religions you cannot mix the boats we live in with me you cannot say the kindness you are helping them you are ruining them they will never know the truth it is not truth when you take a line and make it part of what I call it through you cannot help them you cannot raise it up when you yourself are blind if you read books opposed to religion you are clearing your soul get out of your soul you need no other word than my word to help people to show them truth just show them Who I am because I am NOT in those other books be careful what word you hear that they are not words of deception because great deception is coming on this road the spirit of Antichrist and on this earth anything is speaks against me against my son's blood again - he is that I will allow anyone and everything to come into my home heaven I will not tolerate sin disease I will not tolerate wickedness and evil in witchcraft I will not tolerate abomination I will not tolerate adultery or fornication or human trafficking I can't let those people in they have to come to the blood the blood makes you clean the blood allows you in my son's blood is not a barrier to keep you all is the only way to get in but I can't tolerate or will I allow evil in my home because my home would be just like this earth and I will not do it I say you must come to the door of my son to come into heaven to come into eternity to be forever with me amen [Applause] [Music] if you do not like these words you either get over it or you get in it because nothing is going to stop what I have planned for this world nothing will stop my spirit invading your lives the you'll be touched off life will be touched people will follow and cry out to know me to know my son the fighter will come and burn away on the chaff and will burn away all the regrets all the condemnation of the hate it's going to come and burn and burn and burn all over this world in this land on my people they will carry it everywhere in the world because my word must be fulfilled and I say it has not yet all been fulfilled get off of your rapture rug cos no let's get inside will my son come and take you away nobody knows that and I will tell nobody and I tell you now this is the time to get up to take Dominion to push back darkness to rule and reign get your crown on get rid of your webs get rid of your hate get rid of your confusion get rid of your strife stop judging one another stop criticizing one another I put you here to be light and hope in this world if your doing that stop it start rubbing start caring like it was you when if you were treated that way what if you were spoke to that way you cannot do that and say you belong to me I do know what people cursing one another I want them loving one another but you cannot leave out truth you need the truth and you need love for generations and ages from heaven we have watched this world and there comes a time when I move in my time comes my kingdom is coming to earth the kingdom of heaven is coming to earth no one can stop at you and calling in it for generations I cannot no longer hold it back this is a time to run in the kingdom eggs to rule and reign them to stand up you cannot escape being great and you're running after him this world will not be the sea it cannot remain the same you're in the new time you change with the new time you run into the new time if you don't you're going to become old you'll sink old you'll at old you will be old you cannot be that if you're gonna run with me step into the new and you will roll [Applause] amen I receive it amen well someone is serious this is one of the most important times to be alive on this earth since time began because this is the time when he is opening it all for us nothing to be held back for no good thing will he withhold from those who walk uprightly so those who walk uprightly get ready get ready for the waves that are about to hit you the waves of life the waves of wealth the waves of health the waves of shining like the stars in the heavens the waves that will carry you to places you've never been in the spirit in the earth under the earth in the sky into heaven the waves are coming they're coming they're coming they're coming they're coming everybody say they're coming they're coming they're coming they're coming they're coming they're coming wave after wave after wave after wave after wave of God we'll hit this earth I receive it amen hey Matt one day when you stand before your mirror and you see flames in your eyes you know something powerful is about that because your God will be in you working through you working with you we will be like him his son is about to show up to everybody if you've ever asked for a visitation you're going to get it and when you see you will be like him because you can't be anything else when you have looked in at I any steps in you and you burn from the inside out that's when you'll see the fire on you the fire on your homes every footstep you take will leave fire that's who shall help us to be that's who we are we're not just somebody weak we're not somebody who's wimpy we're not someone who was a doormat he never called us a doormat he never called any of us a doormat we've always been above you should have to look up and see yourself there you've always been seated and have any places with Christ you've always been there from the time you gave yourself to him he took a layer of your soul which is an image of you and he seeded it with him in heavenly places the mysteries are about to be revealed like never before the secrets of the heart of God about to be given to his children you can't be mean the same when you know him this earth will become more and more spiritually minded even if people not understand it it can't stop it from happening angels will be everywhere and people will see them there will be some unfortunately they don't care that would rather partner with the other side it's important that you become connected in the spirit like totally consumed by the holy spirit completely consumed by the holy spirit we're living in a time of forced change not just for our country but for us as the body of Christ you even out there listening if you've been playing or riding on the fence or you haven't quite sure what you want to do with your life you need to run to him no divine encounters no heaven encounters will ever take the place of knowing him it is because of him it is for him and is by him that we get to do this you can't leave him out of your life you can't find a substitute for him no false religion will do it no lives or deception will do it no matter what they tell you no one goes to heaven without Christ he is the only one he's paid a price but he wants you he wants you to know him even you belong to him he wants you to know him those who don't know him he really wants you to know him because great shakings are taking place in the earth the great shakings are for the good they're for God right now but there will come a day even far into the future that the shaking will not be good I've seen those days although he doesn't let me talk about them don't wait until they're here to do something because you can impact generations behind you it's not just you he wants he wants your seed seed cccc he wants your children your grandchildren your great-great-great great-great-great grandchildren he wants them on if you don't stand up a be who you're supposed to be and then teach them that's how it's done he wants them to run with him he wants them to speak the mountains have them jump into the sea you're not raising children you are shaping souls that will touch this world don't leave your children out don't let them play with whatever they want you and don't you give them anything that belongs to the enemy you cannot steal their destiny this is a powerful time some children who are coming to the earth now from heaven he ascending here he needs them here to be powerful leaders in the world and in the body of Christ he wants them to fulfill their destiny do not feed your children witchcraft do not feed it demonism do not feed them hay do not feed them violence do not be the violence do not be the boiler the only violence it is acceptable is spiritual violence against the enemy because we are a violent that take up my Ford from hell who never had any right to it do not reject anything is bringing to you now do not reject asking for grace do not reject loosing from your soul as a lifestyle anything that does not belong there do not keep it do not reject inviting the host of heaven to be your weapon they are not protecting heaven they were never designed to protect heaven they were designed to war and fight for you and with you you cannot give them a request every army needs orders so when this day there will be Kings Lords priests commanders creators in the earth [Applause] these are eternal titles eternal positions but you have to run your race get rid of every wake it keeps you from

that their days are numbered in this world the eve declare freedom and liberty of justice in America and around this world for all of their people God let freedom ring father any man amen hallelujah amen amen you can sit down anytime I'm somewhere and his throne shows up he is going to say something he wants to speak to everybody he wants everyone to know he does love you we're supposed to represent love always but we're not supposed to participate or tolerate care or violence not in your life not in your city not in your country God is against violence it is going to be dealt with harshly not just by our president but what he will do is he will cause others to stand up and do the same thing because then they when they see someone stand up who carries justice and liberty and freedom that will cause that to be spread into their soul and to begin to hunger for that for the country and they will stand up and be bold you will begin to see laws changing and things being abolished around this world because God has someone he chose to sit as the highest level of our land that will not leave him out [Applause] he's creating a pattern in our country you'll see a lot of things change don't be concerned that Trump is going to jump off God's train because he knows he should say her because of him she has a very defined plan that he will work out and if someone tries to come in if a wolf tries to come in to the Sheep pen of his cabinet he will know it and they will be fired God said that something he's really good at doing he doesn't have a problem saying you are fired he doesn't care what your position in how long you've been there how important you think you are if you're doing something that's not right he will fire you never in the history of our country has the president had so many friends as believers and so much Council that are believers and he sought them out his wife is burning for Jesus Christ [Music] we've never had a first lady like her never God is going to cause honor to be shown her even by people that didn't like her or denied her words are just as important as her husband's because they are one so keep watching for her to say powerful things I rejoice every time she says anything and she looks really good saying it it doesn't matter what the liberal media says many of their networks will go under they do not know what truth is they have so deceived their souls and filled lies in their own souls they can't see truth and this is a time when he's not going to allow lies being put to the Airways because the frequencies that are being put there they're our kids he's taken over the frequencies the sounds the waves the words the images he's taking all of them and if they promote the darkness they will not remain God will raise up powerful networks that we can trust that we can believe it will be fair that will love him many changes are coming over the next couple years and for the next twenty four years it won't stop coming [Applause] because at the end of the twenty four years he would have set in place those he wants to be in leadership those who will be handling the wealth those who will be treasure chest to others to help complete people's visions those who will build for the kingdom entire cities not just some buildings those will help set the body of Christ free from debt who will help to pay off the national debt those who will help build the third temple in Israel that his son will sit on one day many firsts are about to happen because we are in the last days but not the last day it would be the first it would see some of the last there will be some of the greatest things that happen on this earth these are powerful days days to be excited to celebrate someone actually said there's no one in the Bible that says the word celebration they're missing everything because they're not looking for something from God they're looking to tweak everybody they think is wrong because you're staying in their box of legalism and self-righteousness so they don't want to receive what God is saying so they look for everything they came to tear down what'd he say if you have friends like that get new friends pray for them but get new friends and this time you need to run with those who are like-minded like they were saying we who are like-minded that wants you helped establish the spiritual kingdom of heaven and deserve heaven will still be in heaven but it's invading this earth and it's not for a revival it is for a habitation [Applause] revivals man always mess where they mess with them they want to control them they want to put them in a box they want to keep it the way that was and not changing me or do anything new where you can't touch a habitation I'd like to see anyone unseat heaven from inhabiting this earth because no one is running into heaven stealing these Ramat from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force does not mean people are running into heaven and bringing violence they're talking about a spiritual violence that word suffers in that scripture means they caused it it means the same thing that this scripture does suffer the little children to come unto me does not mean violence and means caused them to come encourage them to come so let's say that from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven has been causing violence on the insides of believers spiritual violence to take back from the enemy to take it by force because they have no right to it [Applause] that's what that scripture means that makes sense the only violence she tolerates is through violence and he's causing it inside of us because we have had it with the devil we've had it with man trying to tell us what we can do and cannot do when God made this earth and he gave it to us the enemy tried to put violence in the streets for God's about the unleashing spiritual violence in in the streets where hell has been ruling and they will find no place to rule anymore [Applause] in 1965 God showed me these days and I have patiently longingly waited to see them man I've known a lot for a very long time but he wouldn't let me speak about it a lot of self-control which my father had and my grandmother had because they saw those days he told me many many many years ago that there will be a president sitting in the White House that will extend their hand to the believers and they will build like they never built before they'll be wealthy like they never were wealthy before they will have a say in the seat of the government and to the head of the government their permanence will not be withheld any longer you will not have delays in what you want to do you'll be freed of minister free to talk free to walk free to build free to do what he's told you to do and he is about to take some of the most unlikely people and give him some of the greatest things in the land because he can trust their hearts they will not be qualified by man because men never qualifies the chosen but God qualifies the chosen a man you will not have to live up to me and standards for what they think you have to be to have something or do something [Applause] some of the wisest people that will walk this earth probably don't even have a 12th grade education but neither has it been filled with man's ideas or belief systems from universities but they can fear purely and freely hear God's voice and they will shock heads of Nations kings and presidents will come to get wisdom from them so if you're sitting on your little house on a no-name Street all I can say is get ready because a lot of the people he's going to use will be those who've loved him who sacrificed who have never given up doesn't mean we didn't make mistakes just means we never gave up we didn't abandon him and he did not abandon us and man the great learners wise people will still be trying to figure it out when they're left behind in the dust and people are running but for everyday people who know their God to receive wisdom from they will be invited to speak in these learning places or these wise people used to come and speak that never changed their lives it never gave him hope they never showed them who they really were and they'll be welcomed and sought after not just in this nation but around the world because he loves to confuse the why it's going to be a wonderful time to live you I look forward to it every day I wake up if I go to sleep because what's coming not too far down the road is when you step into what he wants there'll be a point in your life where you don't have to eat to live you won't have to sleep to live because on earth as it is in heaven more and more I just don't want food because he is my food he is the air I bruton and no one can take it away fear is about to leave the body of Christ [Music] when I say use greatest weapons is fear he's always used it fear is about to fall on hell fear is about to fall on the enemy there is already following on the army of darkness because now the hosts have commanders and there they are beat up and shredded continually because we have step into our rightful place to come in the host of heaven which was God's plan all along don't swing back from taking that title God said in the word and mentions the captain of the host and the Lord of the hosts because we are the commanders of the hosts they harken under the word of the Lord he sends them down here so he can send them on assignment if God Himself says command ye me why would he care if you were commanding the army that is not worshipping angels no general is worshiping their troops they're giving them orders that they need in order to be strategic in their warfare the hosts do not have power over all the power the enemy but we do they can do little to help us and generally have in areas they have in certain situations they have in the past but in this time in this new time we are to command them and send them on assignment because when you take truly take power and every way over all the part of the enemy nothing by any means shall harm you because they will see the army that is with you it is not our job to fight Satan he's already defeated the hosts of heaven were very well defined and detailed made by God to war against the army of darkness to shred them try some fast them pull down strongholds shred platforms even ruling in high places on when they didn't have anyone to fight I've been to heaven before or Lucifer fell it was a different time there was no time but it was a different way I'll say that it was a different way of life all the army did was go on maneuvers that's all they ever did there was no evil there was no place to war there was no one to war and yet God who loves to confuse or surprise whichever way you want to do it he's strange and I know many people for ages have said our God operates in strange ways but you never really thought he was actually strange himself that's why his ways and his thoughts are strange that's why we don't have them because we try to think practical and logically he's the most illogical being out there because what he says doesn't make sense we would never pick that way and yeah we are strange for those who know him are strange trust me and when we stranger still isn't that good news and we will look different yeah you'll have color in your ear even more so than the world will because he doesn't want you to hide anymore he wants you to stand out it's heaven culture everybody say it's heaven culture come on let it go we have to make a show Oh family in back and the ages ago more than I know I shouldn't tell you that anybody you try we try to figure out God in our own mind it's not gonna work because he did appear somewhere neater natee eternity came from him he told me that personally telling this doctor to figure out when I was he said is easier to figure out eternity came for me than try to figure out when I was because he is that's why his name is I am he doesn't say I was and I will be he says I am its existence so back before Lucifer fell it was a joyous time it happened there's like a Renaissance Fair all the time the angels celebrated they worship they celebrated even Lucifer would shout for joy over his assignment to create worship and sounds for his God he loved his position not for himself he loved God he loved that he got to step inside God the Father and lead worship from inside him he was anointed he was anointed because he was able to step inside him not everyone could do that Michael and Gabriel could when they had to but Lucifer had the right to step in him he actually had created a portal for Lucifer to step inside of him and he would open his beautiful wings all encrusted with gems and his pipes and his taverts would make the most beautiful sound in heaven and he would sing he's saying that's why he controls the music industry that's why he wants your voice that's why he's so after all the people who have a gift to sing he wants their voice because he had the most anointed voice in all of heaven and it was glorious for him he actually created glory for God and then he decided to steal it he came short of the glory of God the first one you ever did he'd step inside God and he would cover over the heart of God and all these beautiful sounds would come from him and all the Angels one-third of angels were worship angels we were in the throne room he was their leader they're the only ones he got he got the ones that were under him someone else believed him when he said is going to take over and he make these beautiful sounds and his voice would go all over heaven not just in the throne room and when he did at the heart of God the Angels would begin to sing and in the heart the fire around the heart of God would begin to burn up inside of him receiving all of that worship that's what happens when we worship Him he consumes our praise our God is a consuming fire that then all he had was the praise of the angels she has ours now we replace them we replace all the Angels that were thrown out that's why he loves you to worship that's what he loves worship that's why he inhabits the praises of what say yes loud before the prese the angels would inhabit him things changed a lot of things James and so he would have that phrase when angel will come down some it would pass right through Lucifer the pastor and all the time he loved he loved to feel the praise of the angels for God and he would make beautiful worship beautiful voice and he loved it and he was inside him so he saw all of us if you didn't know that your home was in him before he sent you here he carried us we were with him all the time when he went to the end we were with him when he came back to the beginning we were with him we've been from the end of the beginning and the beginning to the end before he made desserts we were in him we played in the River of Life we jumped up and down on the stones of fire it was pretty sparkly things we loved them we jump off in the river and swim I jump up another one Jim jumped in swim inside him as a holy mountain and we would all gather in there laugh and laugh and play and then sometimes God would take one of us up in his hand and he would tell us funny stories say he is our Father say it louder he is our father we are his offspring he is our true father no matter what your earthly father was like she is your father sure earthly father may have helped to bring new year but that father sent you here so we were inside all the time you could see life coming in that we would ride out on the Rays of glory this was a scene in the throne room we would rejoice we would sing we would laugh we couldn't go beyond the bands of that rainbow we rode in and out on his glory in him we lived we move we had our being it says the Prophet supposed to vote have spoken of these things did you know that was another part of the scripture I know for a long time what things this because when they lived in God when they moved in and out of him when they had their very existence in him that's where your life was before you came here before he made this planet that's what we existed he was our world we were one people one world one people and we have one God that's why Satan wants the one-world government because he wants to duplicate what God had with us he wants one world one people all worshipping Him and the only can can existence to the mark that he creates everything he does is a copycat of what God had it won't happen if what happened but it won't happen any other way because he wants that because God so has it with those who still live in him there's still some left to come right yes we don't know we don't know when the last one won't be sent only he knows that you just had a mystery given to you so that's what life was like up there was joyous it was celebrating except the host never stopped wondering why did he want us they have gotten so good at what they do because they've been practicing for ages and I've seen those guys I've been to Michael's headquarters and heaven it's on the far end of heaven I didn't even know there was a scripture that said that but I know it's in Isaiah right Rick Isaiah 13 I think where they went to gather the hosts of having to fight on behalf of it went to the far ends of heaven to gather the hosts of heaven to fight on behalf of Israel I do know the scripture the father told me to be there because I've been there I knew where it was like here's heaven right a world that's his house and down years Michael's headquarters it's not a tourist attraction those barracks were like 200 250 feet high that doesn't mean there aren't bigger ones that means the ones who can fit in there they have a place I've seen someone may have like every pore there being they have skin that looks like big pieces of glitter about this big this being appeared actually in the phase house to me when I was spending the weekend there with her and she was sleeping and came into she's got really high ceilings in this part of her home and the Holy Spirit said I'm going to show you one of the hosts so I was awake at 4:00 in the morning and this big piece of glitter came in and floated around and I'm like because I've seen some of them already at this point and went wow it doesn't look dangerous and he says just waiting and thousands of them came in and was filling this room and went whether they're pretty he said we use him to bushwhack the enemy him that meant all those pieces were about to make something another shouted and all these pieces came together and there was this being he was about 30 feet high his arms were like this big around he only had I saw it and he didn't have a mouth because he didn't meet one and he was beautiful to look at until the next thing happened then all of a sudden experts shouted again and out of every piece the glitter that made up his skin came a sphere this long it was a spear like a needle spear and then he began to spin in that room and Holy Spirit said his name is shredder and then he took me out in heaven and he showed me he showed me the camp of the enemy and here was the demons all around they had little camp that's where those words come from ok we have cam so our military of camps right they have bases they have headquarters every one of those words came from heaven because they have that so here was this a demonic camp this demonic army had a camp going on I was watching from kind of afar and all of a sudden this big piece of glitter started going in the camp like it's just floating around and these demons who are absolutely clueless because remember said they lost part of their brain when they fell they all laid their weapons down and run up to the center of this camp to see this beautiful piece of glitter just bouncing around like that they're going oh look at that oh look at that and all the sudden there's about a thousand more coming in behind them that they don't see and all of a sudden in front of them with no weapons shredder go show and he spun around and shredded like missing pieces everywhere from these demons arse arms eyes were coming off then this thing was shredding them and they were screaming trying to get away from him because they got bushwhacked [Applause] and that's just one of them they have a tribe of shredders angels are made in tribes that's what he told me so all the army tribes belong to or under Michael the worker angels describes the messengers the couriers the ones who bring the body parts from the warehouse they planned you empty in this age the ones you make connections and contacts for you all the time start using ma'am did you know that we actually have a lot of help given to us and all we ask for is I need food to eat I need my rent to be paid most of us right I got it I just have to get by that is not who he calls us to be his son did not live like that on this earth no matter what you were told he was not bored by earth standards he was poor when he left heaven he was poor by heaven standards so these creatures I know a lot of them I know Rex I know scout I know jolt who fights with lightning bolts I know inferno who is a fire angel I didn't go find him myself okay Holy Spirit took me know Jesus took me and introduced me to them I know ray me one of the first ones ever met who cares for the babies in one of the baby nursery his naming wise one strong protector and he holds all these new little tiny babies in his hand and he seems to them in the breath of God nurses that little baby spiritual body but can play laughs sing dance declare over you they're not like earthly babies that you have to teach certain things to they already know it when they step out of that little dot of flesh no matter how small it is if it's this big when they are either miscarried or aborted that is an entire little baby body that knows the Lord that loves the Lord that loves you if you are their parents absolutely love you but these angels are powerful and there's many of them and they've been waiting for ages for the time of God to say okay this is the time and the Lord of Hosts goes into the camp Michaels headquarters is okay get ready guys you've got to have more fun than you've ever had in your lives and their battle cry when they go to war is well because they know they're going to win this is what you called you right now everybody's your believer that army was created for you they are fierce they don't look pretty they're not pretty boys but I taught them how to wink and they don't even have eyelids I received my army three years ago and I have not been attacked or sick ever since I've not been attacked the more you send them the more you multiplies them I now have 200 million that go everywhere with me and when I come into the city they come before me they deal with the enemy before I get there they deal with enemy at every Airport and every airplane every piece of land we go over over the ocean we go over and then the air one more than if they hold the plane up it's up to you if you want one [Applause] it's heaven protocol you have to invite Christ in your life before he'll come in is that right you have to invite holy spirit showing to all of you before he'll do that is that right you have to invite you haven't dar me to be one of your weapons if you want one stand up I have testimonies from people all over this world how rapidly their life changed as far and being as far as being attacked by the enemy if you're playing in the camp of the enemy they won't listen to you I want I said where if they what if they stick them on their neighbor and they're not comfortable you say that they're not here to attack flesh unless it's absolutely necessary do you remember when they fought for Israel they actually did fight flats right yeah go read the Bible I think one angel I think you slayed like 85,000 is that correct how many 185 thousand one army one member of the army of heaven they're fierce this is not a game we're playing right now this is something this is of one of the serious parts of what you're going to do because if you ask for an army you can't let them sit there and do nothing you literally will begin to see shapes over your house in the sky if they're fierce they're not the demons okay I've seen a lot of Gabriel's I see them all the time that they were here collecting your worship they were collecting our declarations the whole time you were doing it they were here carrying up back up the step stairway to heaven right up here and they're pouring them in the bowls before the altar they became incensed and I think you were singing about incentives weren't you all the time you were singing it you were creating it these angels these courier angels have these vials that go long they collect they don't let one word one prayer drop to the ground they go in these vials they become like liquid gold it's poor before the the sneeze both before the also before the throne of God and you smell the aroma of your incense it fills the throne room that's why they came we were filling the throne room with our aroma of our praise so God inhabits the praises of his people so what did you expect he came so we're about to help one whole part one-third of the angles to get really happy is something you walk in the more you send them on assignments the moisture you can be strategic okay you can be dangerous you're going to be dangerous when you do this you become dangerous really you do because I've told you they've waited for ages to loosen all of them into the earth and I saw millions pouring in two years a couple years ago and I went this is before I knew about inviting the army and went wow he is really filling the source of these I wonder what's going to go on I didn't know that I have an army and so the father showed up in my encounter room in my home and he said I'm going to teach you how to command an army and I just I look at him most of the time because I can't say anything I'm too undone it's not X going to be familiar you're kidding if I'm going to melt the floor my heart feel is going to beat out of my chest and Here I am looking at me he says you have to invite them it's protocol and you took me back through the word you invited Christ you by the Holy Spirit you have to invite them they are one of your mighty weapons mighty to the pulling down of strongholds in spiritual battles because our weapons aren't what they're not physical right they are spiritual and they they say day our mighty to the pulling down of strongholds okay that's what they want to do in waiting a long time are you kidding this state is ripe for them so this is what you're doing when you do this you're actually you're actually inviting a portion of the army start with a hundred a hundred of these fierce fierce warring army from heaven you get a hundred in the more you use them and multiplies so the next level is a thousand ten thousand a million ten million a hundred million it just keeps multiplying and they don't want to be bored and if you come outside they're all staring at you like that that means you haven't been sending them anywhere because they're not going back to heaven it's like our military's not going back home right when they're sitting here on an assignment they stay with their sense where they're assigned to they will actually receive orders from headquarters to be assigned to you it's all done very official in heaven it's written down that you said yes they are waiting and they will be handing orders you're assigned to so-and-so so-and-so and so-and-so they will be giving you commands and sending you an assignment to pull down the strongholds of darkness where do you send them anywhere their spiritual evil anywhere where there's evil people being controlled by the demonic anywhere the demonic has a strong all is manifesting acting up the storing killing whatever it is we're human trafficking is where drugs are work gangs are it's just pretty much around the world the next time that person in North Korea raises up his head and threatens us everybody's tender army there because agreement is powerful and I tell you what every demon will probably run scream it before they ever reach you because they'll see them coming in the sky like here's millions descending upon them right and they have the right because we took power over them like you have to have the right level of authority to do that and Christ gave it to us so what you're going to get is you and get this army they will whip over your home in the sky they might walk through every now and then they're waiting on you to give orders because every army needs orders they don't want requests say they don't want requests say I'm in God's army I need orders myself till they need orders don't let me forget Holy Spirit I am going to become a commander you can even make out a list ok this tomorrow I'm going to send them here here here here here here it takes seconds in natural time I mean before you can end it and you say go and 10 seconds they'll be back and have done it if you know a bill is being presented before ever get to the place where they're voting on it you take power over all the power the enemy that's promoting and empowering people to present that bill empowering people to vote for that bill you can send the host to pull down all the strongholds as a demonic controlling the old situation you can send a host to your school where your kid goes to to vote on any strongholds of the enemy that are providing or about to wreak violence in that school anyone who's teaching things that aren't of God through all they're all controlled by Satan okay anywhere Satan is controlling that's where you send them okay we're not worrying against the people we're boarding against the demons controlling them like all of human trafficking can be affected if people who minister in the area understand they can send the homes to hold on all the strong laws before they get there to rescue the people that's how it works is his likeness everybody say acceleration this is acceleration the hosts make toast and they really do that that's what they do and I actually tell them to do that I have a button I wear that says the hosts make toast they make burnt toast [Music] we'll learn that chair in a minute okay well this is help we're gonna end this is the most amazing way this end is going to be the beginning of something the end of this day will be the beginning of you Rory amen so don't send them against your neighbor's dog their cat they're there loud music however if they're very to file people you can totally send them against the demons controlling those evil and they'll either get saved change or move I've had many people move from my neighborhood when you move in you get my book you know exactly why I am there if you ever want prayer so this is this is what they're do this is what they were created for to stop the army of darkness to shred them they can't no one can ever stop existing okay now the demons can't stop existing will never stop assisting we are eternal we're all eternal okay but they'll never be immortal there's a difference in immortality journal okay angels are eternal but they're not immortal you will be immortal one day you're already eternal you're not you're not just going to stop you're not going to die for a while and live again you will never stop existing your body dies maybe your spirit man does all of you with your soul goes to heaven has huge parties and celebrates enjoys all your rewards because your Labor's are over but it's still you and one day you get your body back don't cry it'll look really good you're going to superglue that spirit man and you become one being immortal forever never can die never get sick never can send okay we will be immortal it says mortality will take on immortality in the word that's your future okay so it's okay to be a commander if you can be the Bride of Christ if you can be a king and a priest these are all strips of titles correct it's all in the word you can be a commander it's a spiritual title so this is how we do it we invite heavens honor and we make a choice we're going to invite them so we're going to thank them for coming and we're going to thank God for sending them and then you're going to send them on the first assignment this is acceleration because you will have 100 army members waiting to hear your words because Christ lives in you they happen under the word of the Lord and he sent them like so this is what you're going to do people go I don't like that that's wrong they try to they try to label everything out they can I want you give that up and fly it what you just do it okay there's still people arguing that Jesus is the Son of God are you going to get on that train because they've had almost nothing to do and now they are sent for me and you okay so here we go we say father I choose as an act to my will to invite heavens army to be one of my weapons because they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds I received them in Jesus name who is the Lord of Hosts amen okay they're always Nelson so now we're going to send him on their first assignment and this is rocky how the Lord taught me the Lord showed up when the army came in the father was telling me what to do and then the Lord shows up with his army it was amazing a lot of them look like lions by the way if you see lion faces in the sky they're part of the army called the Royal Guard they guard the Royals the Kings the priests in the Lord and they look like I've seen many Lions before I ever knew and that but that's who they are they're part of the Royal Guard because many of them are creatures if you saw about the creatures okay so now we've invited Hammonds army everybody's got your army now we're going to send them somewhere we're going to send them to your own home we're going to start with you okay so the first thing you say is father I take power over all the power the enemy that is attacking my home my finances my family my health my destiny I can be in the hosts of heaven to go to my home and put on every stronghold straight every platform there's a demonic are operating in I commend them to try stamp fast down and throw them in a dry place go now and Jesus say go home make toast [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everything God does is simply we could sit here all day long and try to argue doctrines the theology you know man's opinions or assumptions that you know they're trying to figure everything out their selves that they waste so much time the reason away most of what God wants to do for them this is not the time to read your stuff away this is John said yes to God because if it's not him it will work you didn't do anything that's going to hurt anything okay however stepping into your authority and ruling and reigning with Christ which he has already given us to do it will do powerful things on your behalf anytime you go anywhere everywhere ago I'm taking my city I'm taking it every store I go in every restaurant I go in I send them in before me they will shred every demonic being it is the most wonderful time I ever have in those places because they can't do anything send them when you go on vacations when you go on business trips when you go on mission trips you take them with you everywhere because they're going to go with you anyway I see him outside the plane when I'm on the plane I see them driving on they follow me in my car I I go in the store and come out for Walmart and they're like like this looking at me when I come up the store my staff won't meet my simple money assessment with me and I've been teaching this to them you know how to do this I walked out of Walmart and there was probably thousands of them and you could see their eyes and they're like looking up what does that I want that's my army they make the best toast and so I may come back and do a spirit round boot camp if you let me [Applause] and the holy spirit started having me I don't ever do workshops but I have one now called the host ID workshop and I teach you how to identify them in the sky and we do that inside first I show you all kinds of images of just I actually do know the weather I show you cumulus cumulonimbus Nimbus Stratus Cirrus I'll show you what real actual clouds are then I show you the hosts pressing themselves in the clouds then you see the shape of one then you see literal ones because I have pictures of them and so you learn when there's like six sets of eyes like that looking at you from the clouds that's not a cloud with a strange formation if you see clouds that are shredded and twisted and going up everywhere that is spiritual activity because they fight in the sky their camouflage is the clouds and they'll press themself in that cloud and people all over the world are seeing them okay well now you have an army you're responsible for that army you can make a list of things you've been trying to break through and get taken care of send the host to every one of those places whether it's a whether it's a court deal with a support case whether it's a business deal whether it's a house you're trying to buy whether it's something in your finances you're trying to get straightened out I'm telling you write a list okay write a list and you'll be shocked to see how quickly things begin to change they're sent here to keep us in all of our ways is that correct yes well we're about to let them do that and they will you begin to see them over your house you will see them you'll come outside see strange figures over your house if you come out every day they're still there that's down you drive your car summer I get out now is the same one you saw over your house to over the store that sound and so I made a cure for them for last thing I'm going to teach you the Holy Spirit said they've never had anything like me before okay in the past that you know the priest would cry out to God the people cry out for God to help them in Israel they cry out for God to help the priests were going in there and cry out to God and he would send in a host literally they came and they fought the people they killed the wicked people I'm not saying they can't do it I'm there may be a time when they do do it on this earth to preserve people's lives that God needs to keep here but what they're sitting here now for is so that we can push back darkness and we will create regions of light by doing this I'm driving them out of my city there's not one place I don't go that I don't send them in there to deal with them I Drive my to my neighborhood first and so anyway this is your now is your responsibility you are now a commander of the host it's going to be a normal way of life for the body of Christ any believer you know if you want to show them in the scripture you go to Isaiah I think is Isaiah 13 I can't always remember exactly but by the way if you want to description about I said go to Hebrews 8 and read about the heaven is Hebrews 11 right nick is 11 h is 11 and n go look in chapter 11 in Hebrews and we'll talk about heaven being a city in a country so if you ever wondered yes they have massive cities they have huge beautiful stuff in the country up there and now the hosts of heaven are down here a whole lot so anyway they will set up camp over your home and sometimes my army my army hemisphere would bring the demons that they had caught and bashed and they bring him on this long chain over my house and I see them when missing body parts I mean it went forever one guy my life is this a parade they were bringing shabby debris over my house okay that's what if you weren't here last night the Holy Spirit calls the Satan's army shabby debris and I mean they had eyes missing they had arms and they were terrified because they had just been beat up by the army general okay so we've already sent them you are now responsible and always start by saying I take power over all the power of the enemy and then you say what you want to take power over this bill about to be passed and such assets this is I command you host go pull down the strongholds that is promoting that bill empowering people to put that bail out you have to know what to say okay I take power over the enemy trying to operate my kids elementary school influence the children and evil ways or whatever is going on there to stop any violence and taking place a community go pull down all the strongholds around them and for the protection of God to be upon them and I'm telling you they will do it instantly they know when they shred those platforms what that is is high places that Satan is taken over generations because evil people are in certain regions and areas they literally can build on the sins of the people a platform and then they can see because demons can't be everywhere all at the same time you neither can Satan okay they only know by what you say what you agree to say they build high places but you can command the hosts to shred those platforms and it becomes like dust and then those high demons fall down they have no longer the ability to see in that region send them in the hospitals to pull down strongholds of infirmity sickness disease that's coming against you your family people just do it for fun you passed by a hospital make sure you send them in there okay someone's in there suffering from the enemy so there's all kinds of things I'll probably eventually put a post up on my website giving a whole list of things you can send them we're in a new day okay we're going to stand up and rule every King has an army is that correct and they don't give them requests they give them orders so father I thank you for allowing me to come here and declare for you to declare not just to your people but to our nation into this world god I thank you for trusting me with the souls of those you love may the peace of God the joy of the Lord his presence his life consume you may you know his ways may you have his thoughts when you walk in them may you receive them may you speak them may you bring life and hope and help the people around this world when you burn and shine like the stars in the heaven then you'll be above and not beneath and never tolerate the enemy in your life again nor participate by saying you don't have or you can't do because he put his son in you amen receiver I tell you why you're behind you sit out I want to share one more thing I usually do share this when I'm teaching people about the host and that is everyone does everyone here agree that as born-again believers followers of Jesus Christ you believe we are joint heirs is that correct you do understand that means what he had and what he has is ours that correct what he did when he was on the earth we can do and we can do great or is that correct because it was a scripture that says Jesus actually said this in the word if I wanted to I could call on the army of heaven to come and fight on my behalf you need to go search that scripture out because he said that himself but he didn't do it you know why he didn't do it because it's our job it was one of the things he was saving for us he used to send the hosts all the time in the Old Testament to war I map of Israel and he could have he was talking about you know when he's going to go to the cross he was saying if I wanted to I could call them to come and fight on my behalf but he couldn't do that because we all know he had to go correct and let me tell you they wanted to fight every one of them wanted to fight they would have wiped that place out but he had already had many talks with them in heaven cannot interfere they wanted they still they still didn't get it you know they didn't want the word to have flesh and come and die for us but the host had to listen to him he said okay I'm giving you order and you were not going to interfere okay you are not going to interfere so he never called on them to do that but he said if he said I can call them to come and fight in my behalf then you are not doing anything wrong by calling them to come and fight on your behalf amen very good very good all right we have a we have lunch we're going to let first

Lord shows her is really profound so cat and so why don't you come and share whatever is on your heart and we look forward to it yeah there you go yeah let's stand up yeah and welcome her honor give honor where honors do yeah yeah very good very yes I gotta have my phone tell what time it is god bless you think there's a clock okay I may not look at that clock right you know right here I can look down to what time is although time really is irrelevant to me in heaven they have no time isn't that amazing it's a whole new way of life up there down here we have to keep everything scheduled and on time we have timeframes to me we have meetings you know you have to be done by some time that doesn't exist in heaven no they don't care how long you go because heaven is like forever right and if you don't know in heaven if you're going to have an event at your house and everybody does that you want you know how many people have never heard me before let me see your hands anybody here not know me Wow have you never heard of me or heard me let me see your hand you may have seen me on youtube or something I love them people go I just met you on YouTube I said I didn't know it was a meeting place but we love I love you I said we love you too that would be Father Son Holy Spirit in me if you hear me say we or they that's what I'm talking about somebody kept saying who are they Father Son and Holy Spirit who else is there right I mean if you know them you're going to talk about they I know they're a Godhead and I even know what the three-in-one is if you've never heard me say that when God speaks it is the simplest form of communication he doesn't you know he doesn't get people confused he doesn't stretch things out he doesn't expound he just says what is true and it is called they are the three-in-one that means three individual beings father son who used to be the word he was called word forever never never until he became Jesus Christ maybe didn't know that and John it explains it the word became flesh and dwelt among us right and it says it says that there wasn't anything that was made he was God he was with God and there wasn't anything that was made that was not made by him and so we're thinking well how can he make it if God made it actually that's sort of the same explanation about the three-in-one they have the ability to step inside of each other remember when Christ said you and me was talking to the Father you and me and me and you Father I pray that one day they'd be one even as we are one when you go to heaven you step inside the Father Jesus steps inside the Father Holy Spirit steps inside the father and you are one now isn't that simple that's really how that's really how it happens the father is on the throne he's not super glued to the throne by the way people think he stays there forever never no he doesn't he gets up he goes around heaven he spends time with people he has a throne room outside and from these amazing powerful mountains it looked like there they go miles and miles miles in hi where this would be an anthill compared to mountains in heaven by the way it really is I mean there's angels 2,000 miles high in heaven I'm just going to put her out there for you you ever wondered how big it was you can't limit the one you made every this earth was made like a speck in his hand all of the universe which he calls the cosmos the cosmos was made was made by him and his son what the word used to do is he would step inside the father the father would go where there was nothing he spoke what he wanted the word stepped out and made it that's why his name was the word because whatever God spoke he took it and made it and they made Adams body together they made all that you see all the unseen made the seen realm there's so much you could talk about I am going to talk about America tonight I can't escape it it's the number one thing right now that heaven is talking about is America ok God God didn't start something and then decide to drop it no oh he's moving and shaking everything in our country it's time for exposing all that was wrong and setting in place that which is right and so just for those of you who don't know me I was born again at age 4 I'm going to be 65 I kept saying I was because I forget how old I am and I'm getting younger because it says he would restore our youth like the Eagles right that wasn't just a statement he made is something you run after what you declared that we shall be established unto you you shall eat the fruit in your lips right your words are so important in the in this atmosphere in the world in your own life your words are what you create with everything he made He willed it he spoke and then it was pretty much that's the way was to operate our own life okay because if were his children for his offspring and he is our Father how much like him are we supposed to be you're living in the time when that will be openly seen in this world people living on earth like they do in heaven they call it heaven culture so don't try to change the culture just start living having culture and then you know you're different because your very life will change when you begin to do that God for the first time is letting us live on earth as they live in heaven and he calls that heaven closer I'll be talking about that tonight and it's powerful I have to live it I can't just tell you about it I literally have to live that way in my life and I do and I have not been sick in over three years I have not been attacked in over three years at all because he said and I took these words and I believe them that I live by them they give you power over all the part of the enemy and nothing by any means shall harm you so if you sit there saying that's not possible than his word right he put it in his word he meant that it's the way you live it's a type of lifestyle you have guys not given you some nice new news to hear he's given you a whole new lifestyle to live it's not something you try is something you do so you're going to hear about some new things tonight because we've got so much revelation about heaven that was one of the reasons why he showed me so much of it I know how they live I know how they communicate with each other now they're transported know how heaven operates I know what God's plans are for this earth I saw heaven before the earth was made I think glimpses of the new earth I've been anywhere everywhere in between because he chose to take me say Amen I'm going to ask you this actually I'm just going to tell you this you may not know this but everyone here has actually already been from the end of the beginning and the beginning to the end because you were in him before you came here you've always been in him so whatever he went you were with him - how about that you came from you went to the Future came back in the future he sent you here to this earth but before he did that you have been everywhere with him Wow is not a new way to look at you yeah got me undone I've actually travelled through time you know when they go into warp speed you know all those lights flying at you that is exactly what it looks like it was crazy I've always wanted ever since Star Trek especially I've wanted to be an astronaut my goal in this physical realm was to be an astronaut and I wanted to go you know I want to go check out the universe I wanted to go see the stars the planets I was captivated by what my God had made I want to be out there where he was I wanted to be in there with him even as a little girl I thought that way I was strange then ha ha ha my mom almost told me every day of my life you're so strange I don't know what God's going to do with you and my answer was always anything he wants to [Applause] I had earthly father there was an amazing dad he loved everybody including his enemies really loved his enemies - either they were embarrassed or they became his friend you could not have a fight with my father he just wouldn't do it he loved too much and he believed in God and he lived it he was talking when the most precious people I ever knew in my life and he is now in heaven celebrating on his massive ranch that I couldn't see the end to taking care of all of our pets I know every time we said when I hear him go egads you sent another one did you know nothing was impossible - God did you know he loves his creation and he loves his creatures and heaven animals aren't called animals down here we call them that and having them called creatures because every creature speaks in heaven every creature in heaven worships God they all have the ability to talk your pets will never shut up if you had a dog that drove you crazy and on your neighbors you better send them on it you know send them on a tour to go share something with people in heaven because they're not ever going to shut up and they get a hold of you you want your bark bark bark you hear did you know this happened and I saw this and this was there and I remember when you did this to me it took me here and I got to do that and all the Christmases already to get a chew on the presents and rip the paper off the present that's what you got to look forward to out there your cats climbing up from the Christmas tree trying to get them down meeting on a little your furniture they will not be doing that in your mansion when you really think about life you know through God's eyes it's amazing he looks at everybody here like you're totally complete you know if you belong to his son you're precious actually everyone is precious he loves all humanity everyone came from him there was not one person that came from some other planet there not an alien they weren't birthed by Satan although sometimes you think they were he didn't create anything except sin Satan owns nothing he's not even supposed to be in the second heaven one day he's going to be kicked out of there maybe you've never considered that by God to show me so much of the future I know how powerful we are because of Christ and how small and insignificant the enemy is our doormat we are not a doormat you are never created to be a doormat know what people say that turning the other cheek does not mean you're going to let someone beat you to a pulp because the Jesus Christ that means you choose to ignore all awful things that they've said about you all the excavations all the blast all the blasting and they've done you you turn the other cheek because you choose not to respond back and do what the enemy wants you to do okay but you're not a doormat you considered royalty in heaven if you are okay if we are kings and priests and to our god what is that that is a spiritual title of authority in this earth it's an eternal title of authority so how much authority you have as much as you're willing to take for Jesus Christ we have been given so much this is just my introduction okay I'm just trying to get because there's new people and even I want to just you know blow your box apart I tell you Jesus Christ never put anyone in a box he was out of the box in his day he was funny he was funny he was extremely rich when you satin ate with sinners those were business acquaintances he had he was extremely wealthy okay uh the only thing that draws wealth is wealth he has some of the wealthiest loans okay even Lazarus was extremely wealthy he had some Christian wealthy friends but he had some that weren't and he was he was the most captivating person they knew and if all he did was beat them up with sin they would never satin ate with him but I promise you he shared the truth he captivated them with revelation with understanding probably of outer space and other things that was never known on years before he is the spirit of prophecy that right I promise you use prophesying all the time to those people he read their books all the time while I ate with him he told some of the greatest jokes of all time I know he was it was like Jesus in his Merry Men that's what it was like I had seven brothers I they did when they got together okay it wasn't any difference they didn't follow Jesus necessarily because he was the lord of glory he was a lot of fun he always supplied in paid for all their upkeep wherever they traveled he took care of all their whatever they say whatever they ate you know he paid for that you don't have a treasure to hold your nickels he had a treasure that traveled with him he wasn't poor that's just man's tradition that told you that you're not supposed to be poor I know that the word says and I'm going to explain this is a revelation he gave me that that he became poor that we might be okay what is rich is that poor is that poverty level is SOC humble or there's that humility of holiness no he said be holy as I am holy that's the condition of you inside there's nothing doing how much money you don't have okay the enemy is not supposed to have all the money he's not we're supposed to be some of the wealthiest people in this world someone who should have the most wisdom the most fun the most money be the most radical people in asserts because we belong to him and I know what man's mindset has always told us because I was raised in wonderful denominational churches and Christ isn't abandoning the church he is married to the church guess who the churches it's us it is the body of Christ okay we're married to him how much does he love you if he's married to you he cares about everything in your life but you need truth in Revelation so that will dispel all the things the myths and the lies and the bondage that the enemy has taught man to put us in and if you don't have revelation and this time revelation comes from God it doesn't come from man when you hear something you've never heard before that came from God like explaining how what the three-in-one is how simply caught me up I think up to heaven thousands of times I lost count I stopped counting okay I don't count anymore it doesn't even matter even this morning he showed me things in heaven I get up for the first two hours he's pretty much kills me with revelation I don't want to leave the room because I want more and I start my day by talking to him I start my day when my eyes open father I ask for and receive grace for this day for abundant life and they filming fuel from heaven did you know you can get that every day yourself jewel from heaven for every day of your life that's why Christ could walk through this earth the way he did did you know that the word says that the father filled his son with His grace while he was a child you will find it you look it up well what does good grace does God have I'm not mother father the father has grace he actually has a throne of that's his throne and he says come before my throne of grace is that right to find grace for help in time of need is that what the word says that means to come and get it for every day of your life what is that grace its grace for abundant life Christ gives us grace for eternal life say correct yes but there's more and you can live the abundant life by asking for that grace I know I've been doing it for like eight years it changed me it changed me the first day I did it because I didn't come out of that room filled full of me I came up filled full of heaven it's almost like it's laying just like you're walking in a dream but it's real because nothing can penetrate or touch you like before things used to pierce you right they pierce you they wound you you get upset or you get offended even though you didn't want to you get angry really angry about things so frustrated in confusion none of that can penetrate you that's why you didn't penetrate Christ okay God didn't even give him a choice he is as I filled my son with my grace as a child I feel my son with my grace that was great for abundant life that's why Christ said I come to bring life and bring yet more abundantly it's really all in the word and I received so much revelation on the word it also changed me that's not man's interpretation it's not man's mindset or assumption of what they think it means it's from the Father amen Jesus introduced me to the Father he's the only way back to the Father he is a door to the Father and the reason why he was willing to die was because he knew he would open that door for us to receive him and it would bring us back to heaven where we came from this the gospel is very simple okay we had to have a way to come back to him we had to have something that was holy enough to be sacrificed they would wipe away all the sins because Christ doesn't keep you out of heaven he's the only way to heaven his blood doesn't keep you out of heaven it keeps wickedness evil in sin out of heaven so the only way you get rid of that stuff is by receiving him say Amen because the father has absolutely informed me face-to-face it says the pure in heart shall say that really loud don't let people say you cannot see the face of God Christ is what changed it on Christ when you receive him and his sacrifice it wipes everything out literally in the spirit realm when you receive guys you get a shower of the blood of Christ on the inside that wipes everything off every sin from as far back as you ever did it it removes it from you like you never did it it makes you righteous okay that means you have you're standing upright before God you have right standing before God because of Christ that is what Glaus you into heaven okay because you're not going in there carrying all your sins witness and evil and the father has in ant face-to-face to me sad I will not allow the entire earth come to heaven the way they are because if either all earths come to heaven without my son heaven would be just like this earth and say we don't want it like that why living here and go through all this mess right why go through all this stuff that's in people in wicked people evil everyone live like that and go to having to live the same way say he kicked it out and it's not coming back in so people who tell you a loving God wouldn't send people to hell he doesn't he actually makes away so you can come back to him he wants you to come to heaven but there's only one way there and that's still his son Jesus Christ I'm just preaching preaching right now I was I was raised on this stop I was raised we live by faith we lived that way growing up I'm one of 15 that alone was not easy that will kill you right there people say you're going to have a school if I have the school it would be the school of dying the school of dying to your flesh is what we all need amen I had to die to my flesh to do this I I couldn't be continually being taken up to heaven before the father showing me the future showing me the past showing his the very way he's made and created on the inside on the outside revealing the Word of God to me and he didn't do any of that just so I would sound good he did it to change you he wants you to know who he is so you'll know who you are amen because the more we know them the more you know you let us make man in our image and after the way we operate did you know that's what the word likeness meant people think he's saying the same thing in Genesis 1:26 there's a scripture for you what does it make man in our image and after our likeness there's the word our again father-son hold spirit let us make them look like us and let us help them operate like us so that's where I get all the authority the Dominion having revelation understanding what life is in heaven you know that's what that means that's what that means I can operate like them because I know how they operate right and so this is what we need to hear up here behind a pulpit to be a holy place that brings life hope a future in freedom ok that's what it was made for it was never meant to spread deception deception is the opposite of truth deception puts you in bondage it does not make you free although many people say you can freely sin I don't know anywhere in the entire Bible that he ever said you can freely send you well they're preaching that if you've never heard it I promise you I were preaching it sometimes in Christian colleges check out the professors who are teaching your children it's reading one of the worse I call it a plague when the worst plague done on the earth today is deception and many people are being pulled on because it just sounds right it sounds kind you know the grace covers everything and so freely sin because the grace will cover it but that's what they're saying they're saying you don't have to repent and I know the scriptures and he's talking to believers when he said this if you confess your sins that he was righteous and just to forgive you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness because unrighteousness is not right standing with God you see that sin means you don't have right standing with God if you repent what did you just say I will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you from all of that so you again have a right standing and you are righteous sin and never helped anybody except the devil and did you actually know that you can live sin free I live sin free I do not sin I don't send it all not about anything anytime anywhere I don't send and I'm a human I'm a female human who lives in free on this earth and it's more fun than sinning that doesn't mean I'm going to beat you up about your issues or your mistakes okay I used to have issues and mistakes myself but there was a point in my life where I decided I'm not I'm tired of it it's not worth it it's helping the devil it's giving him ammunition you're going to beat you up later with it I mean really beat you up because it gets in your soul and he reminds you all the time I know people I know people they're finally free after years and years of years of being stuck in that snare of the enemy then he put you then he wants you there okay and eventually he's going to drag you to hell and torture you he doesn't love anybody not even his own demons he despises them he rules them with fear don't let fear in your life God never told us to fear and actually he said fear not take no thought for what your life I think it pretty much covers everything people go people said how could you stand there and say that the way you said it like like like what it was real because it was real I mean I knew I absolutely knew that he had chosen Trump for the presidency I even knew his reasons he didn't have to tell me but he did because he was the right person in case you didn't know he likes business people I was a business person I was not a pastor of an in the Fievel ministry I was a business person he pulled me out of my knifes office job and stuck me here with pink hair that was before that was before even it was heaven culture I didn't know that was normal in heaven but it is everybody has color in their hair in heaven some of them have diamond dust some of them have living stuff put in their hair it's alive now does that sound like heaven yeah you shout glory to God you create a rainbow bridge and you cross over the crystal sea now that doesn't sound like this world does it when anyone talks about heaven you better hear stuff you never heard of before unless you've been there it should be something that captivates your mind that you never even consider because that's what the word says I have not seen nor ear heard nor entered in the heart or mind of man see I do know the word except unless the Spirit of God reveals it to you that's the rest of the scripture some people say part of a scripture am i making that sound is that me I know I know what the word says and in heaven was one of the greatest mysteries probably the last greatest mystery of all time what does it look like everybody knows we worship as as a worship you knew you got two pieces of clothing a gallon of salvation and a robe of righteousness right yes it didn't say you're going to get wings in heart by the way you don't want wings what would you do with a 12 foot high pair of wings on the back of your foot the back of your person you would sit on shut them in the door whack people when you move to the right or the left who's not people over you were never created to be an angel we actually are over the Angels it says that we will judge angels right yes so don't think that you're lower than the Angels I know there's a scripture that actually says God made you a little lower than the Angels but you know in the Greek and Hebrew you know with that word actually means I made you a little bit lower than them we were made a little bit lower than down right I don't know if you knew that but that's what that says I guess I think that DM and I remember who was at the the English that translated the Bible right the King James Version taking Holy Spirit the King James Version I think maybe they thought that was just too wild that we were a little lower than God but he said no not the year gods and that's a little G did you know that's in the word we all do but nobody wants to go there because you don't know what it means it means he is our Father we are made in their image to operate like them we will never be God say Amen he's not going to give you a plant with a bunch of people okay you have to win and then help get there and go so that you're not going to repeat that all right but he will give you a planet one day to create fun places on it you're staring at me does that sound like God I'm not talking about a human who made the planets is there anything on them no say no there's no civilizations on the planets they're a blank canvas [Music] if our father is a Great Creator right and his son the word created with him that's how they operate okay that's why we have inventions where do you think they come from it says every witty idea comes somewhere yeah they come from having people invent creat all over heaven all the time even more than you do here his ultimate goal for us is to do that you don't have to take vacations somewhere on heaven now number one you're not going to really work you're going to use your gift where's your gift not your job you have now say Amen you will not have a 8 to 5 or 9 to 5 job when you take a little card and stick it in the time clock which by the way I used to do that a long time ago you're not going to have some supervisor breathing over your neck because you didn't do something right you can't be fired he's not going to take away your retirement point that is your retirement plan living there ok all of your family member and friends are having the best time of their life they're not suffering they're not sick not all they're not handicapped or not in fear amen they don't experience any of that in heaven they exist to live their body might be dead the day you know what it says the dead in Christ to rise that is your body say that's my body it's still a part of me that part sleeps well we have an awesome time in heaven it clearly says that and let me tell you I always tell people if you choose to die and go to heaven you will not miss the rapture when it happens you actually know about the rapture before any human being on earth knows about it because you will be coming with them is that right it says that you get your bodies back first it will be instantly glorified forever and you will then be immortal not mortals and then those who are alive and remain in my correct my being correct those who are alive and remain will be caught up and changed in an instant right in your own body you'll be changed instantly you will be glorified you will become immortal because as immortality must take on immortality there you go there's there's a sermon from the Bible however when you got revelation on that it gets a lot more exciting okay revelation you're supposed to live like they do up there right now on earth you know source of waste you get to heaven okay you know suppose the way to get to heaven no because we have been calling this in for probably ages or generations at least when Christ said pray this way right our Father now who are we talking about one I'm not going to make some clarification here when he said our Father he meant the Father in heaven right our Father who is in heaven holy is your name that's what how old means okay holy is your name whose kingdom is coming say that's heaven that he's talking about say the kingdom of heaven is what Jesus was talking about so we're basically telling the father your kingdom of heaven come to earth and then what is that going to look like your will on earth as it is in heaven that is called heaven culture that is a way of life okay so I'm not making this up it's in the word it's on the word that meant there had to be a time before the millennial reign I'm talking about before the end comes there had to be a time when heaven would be seen operating innocent through us on this earth living on earth like they do in heaven because we asked for it we declared it decreed it god had already planned it this is before the Millennial age because Christ won't need our help say Amen but the word also says that there will be a generation a group of type of people on this earth that will taste of the powers of the age to come well the next age after this kingdom age is the Millennial age that means we are that group and type of people that will taste to the powers of the Millennial age where people will live to be seven and eight and nine hundred years old that's that's one of the manifestations of heaven being on this earth and there you go I mean that really doesn't even I mean you don't even mention having in that part but it does say there'll be a group and type that we're generation means in the word it can mean three things just because I'm going to clarify some more stuff for you hum a little people okay the word generation can mean a time span most of the time it doesn't by the way two other meanings are a group and type of people and it means an age you can go look it up okay this generation shall not pass away until all these things be fulfilled including the coming of the son of man that word generation means a group and type of people and everybody thought it meant those who are alive when Israel became a nation and that generation that was here when Israel became a nation in 1948 that they would not pass away until the coming of the Son of Man it happened so that age grew which I obey now all right that was almost 60 years ago am I correct yeah well if people were 60 and 70 then where are they right now if they belong to Christ they're in heaven right now that word in that scripture did not mean a time span it meant a group and type of people that means it could be whenever God chose her to be on the earth that a group of type of people would live like they would in the Millennial days when sickness would be almost non-existent that they would live to be hundreds and hundreds of years old because it also says about the Millennial age that if someone died at a hundred would be like a child dying because back in the ancient times you all should know this yourself people live to be six and seven hundred years old is that correct yeah that was the fourth flood that was before all that stuff happened that's how old people live and I'm thinking man how easy was that mean they weren't live in heaven culture right but God sustained them and what about Sarah all the women say I am NOT Sarah I don't want to be Sarah she was a hunter when she had a baby but let me tell you she looked amazing she looked really good for being that old because God had purpose to give Abraham his promise right and you know why he needed that promise so the Jewish race would exist on the earth so he always had a plan of why he did things he has a plan while you're sitting here right now because he wants you to live on earth like they do in heaven it is my number one thing that he has me teach about besides America okay living on earth like they do in heaven well heaven is amazing there's no way to even look at this right now and you actually had a glimpse of heaven you think I don't know how that is possible well because of God and his timeline it is very much possible amen this is the thing you have to do you have to choose to live it your will is the most important thing in you you will is the heart of your being when God said heart he meant your soul amen your soul you're not just a human being you are a living did you know that he said Adam was a living that means you are - that's how important your soul is well I know what human soul looks like I know how it operates I know how to make it prosper why did he show me that so you could do it it's the most important thing you probably ever learn because you'll change your whole entire life you'll change how you live you change your physical condition your mental condition the way you operate the way you act the way you respond to people what you think about and what you choose will change so yeah I've seen a living soul it's it's beautifully made and I know growing up in the past in mind denomination we always told the soulless realm was bad how many people say Amen you knew that maybe you didn't know back in the day when they talked about the soul it was never good and yet we would all say oh my soul and others within me bless your Holy Name right and yet they would turn on say the soul is not good I'm like I'm like eight and I'm like are they thinking about what they're saying because what they told me a few minutes ago does not line up with the fact that my soul's rejoicing and blessing God so if all that is within me is if my soul was bad and all that is within my soul is bad how can I bless him did they know what they're talking about obviously didn't know what they were talking haha it's true isn't it this is how revelation changes you when he shows you in reveals in the word this is what I meant when I said this but there's a way to make your soul prosper and he even says in the word it says in the word if you want to prosper and be in health what does it say so if if your soul people used to say ignore the soul just focus on the spirit and I have to be your spirit man is very important right you have that spirit before you have this body we're a little being your spirit was made out of light it still is made out of light but in heaven which is a spiritual world in a spiritual realm you have a literal life I mean you touch things you have a real mansion you live in that spiritual body operates in the spirit realm sort of like your physical body does in this earth say Amen I'm not going to tell you something that's not true I would be in trouble with my father and I'm not going to do that heaven is a spiritual realm okay your spiritual body came from there it says in the word our citizenship is in you know where you came from is where your citizenship is that right my citizenship here is in America I was born an American I am an American god bless america god bless the red white and blue you know I was born in America so my citizenship is there wherever you're born in the world that's where your citizenship is some countries let you have a dual citizenship like England will let you have one there and have on you I think Canada probably will I'm not sure but I know there are some countries that let you have two citizenships well our original citizenship is from the place we came from it's heaven or he wouldn't have told you your citizenship was there well that's how that's this is how detailed the father is being right now with me it's detailed revelation because you have to see yourself that you came from there you didn't live on a planet you didn't have a home in heaven at that time God was your home the father he said I am your father you are my offspring I carried you like in a womb of a mother and he actually said we played in the River of Life so when he made the womb of a woman he put water in it so it would be normal to us that makes sense when he sent you from themselves he made that womb sort of like when we lived in him we played in the River of Life so we were in water all the time in that awesome you ran inside of the father and played on the stones of fire that shoot the rainbow outside of him you played in the rainbow you played in the rainbow don't we all go oh look at that rainbow because something deep inside of you gets reconnected with him when you see those colors it's here sign say that's God's sign and that's his promise the image belongs to him and he recently told me whoever wears that image or fly that image is calling me to them [Applause] somebody get Marge Gardner [Applause] there's a whole group of people marking themselves for salvation [Music] it will never be anyone else's image it says there's a rainbow round about the throne it comes from him net awesome I love rainbows what about double rainbows and triple rainbows around rainbows I've actually seen round rainbows I've actually seen God draw a round burnt rainbow in the sky with his finger I was in a foreign country and I saw him do that she told me my father to fast and pray for three days and meet him on this mountain and he drew a round rainbow right where right above where we were took about two hours it was glorious sing and for the first time I saw heaven coming down to that rainbow I saw a living stairway come it looked like glory mist and I saw angels walking up and down in that and coming down to that rainbow he actually drew a portal in the shape of a rainbow and awesome [Laughter] God loves color he created color he created everything and he loves color he loves coloring your hair on your clothes yeah I love your purple dizzy you are rocking it and yes he did tell me I would have pink highlights in my hair I didn't I wasn't a pink haired person trust me I was a business person I had a wonderful job I worked with CEOs I loved it I trained in the business industry I've worked there for 25 years and 10 he got really strange and took me out and made me wear pink hair started taking me to heaven [Music] he didn't even warn me didn't even warn me okay he didn't warn me and I never said I want pink and I want to go to heaven all the time I didn't say that I'm like I'm going to do whatever you want me to do I'm going to speak for you I'm going to breathe for you on a bu one assistant want people to see when they see me I want them to hear you when they hear me I want to love like you love I want to give like you give that's just what I used to say to him all the time you heard me all the time say that to him and I would just take time and sit in a room and I would just sit there and tell how much I loved them I did that day after day after day after day after day and one day Jesus Christ walked through the wall of my home for the first time I was probably like 25 years ago and he and he never stopped his presence will consume me he begin to share things with me I just was so much in love with him I understand there's a higher love than our physical law in heaven that's what you experience you you don't crave things like your physical flesh did down here as far as the love is concerned there's a much higher love in heaven trust me his name is Jesus Christ and so I I was taken on this journey through my whole life helped with all my siblings I'm number 3 there were 15 of us we had one bathroom that right there she had killed yeah my brothers all thought they were mr. wonderful they took more time in the bathroom than any of the girls did we were all a bunch of my mom used to say I raised all chiefs and no Indians okay and we all thought we knew everything you didn't we didn't have visitors in our home we did have victims however because we get you in a corner and we would drill you and talk to you all of us at the same time it was loud and noisy but we had God it wasn't perfect but we did know God amen and he raised me that way on purpose so I would know he was real and I know a lot of people weren't raised that way they didn't have a good childhood they didn't have parents that loved them or they were abandoned or rejected or worse they were abused and we helped people like that so I knew that stuff existed my dad would move him in would love them we would help people every way we can we give him our food our clothes our furniture we had never-ending changes in her household we didn't have a decor okay it was called giveaway that's what it was we had giveaway furniture because we always gave it away we found people who had less than we did and we wanted to help change their life and and you live in the greatest time to be alive anew because of what he's about to give us I look at money as something to help people to help to heal to bless we need money and Christ was extremely wealthy and I'm also going to give you some revelation before I actually start talking about what I'm supposed to talk about my introductions are exciting but I do usually have a focused revelation to give you focus you will be glad you know that the last four years I have stood in the middle of America on Resurrection morning usually in the morning when I'm supposed to be sleeping he even stretches me and he'll give me stuff to declare and release in the atmosphere at a high level of authority that shocks and shockwaves to the land through the air through the sea and releases his voice and his purposes in the earth I've done that every single year that's where I'll be next year and and then I say things and I see in the spirit what happened when I did it and we were heading into powerful times we can't escape it we just we cannot escape it and my sister has recently given me not Jen but one of my other sisters have given me a key keys are one of the symbols of the kingdom age if you don't have like big keys or something to hang around hang on get crowns symbols of crowns keys peacock feathers are talking about seers the seer anointing it also represents royalty and the living creatures and having this way have eyes and their feathers there's many defined things oops that was anointing I just been on the platform I just leave it up here so I do that to my sister by mistake Jen she goes you spit on me what you were highly anointed now she says I have my own anointing I know but don't spit on me so he had me take this key she gave me no this long it's got gems all the way out the stem of the key around it but in the middle is a magnifying glass and when she handed to me God said this is a key for clarity and he had me take that and actually had me unlock a door of clarity he had me unlock it first for President Trump and vice president pounds that they would have clarity and hear him clearly and and have clarity in every decision they made so watch for more clarity in them I unlocked I literally saw a spirit of clarity fly over 2 DC into the White House and then he had me unlock it again for the body of Christ everybody say I receive clarity in my life [Applause] it helps you focus it really helps you focus because you it's very clear you know the vision is clear to you what he said it's clear to you the path is clear to you that he's putting you on he put you on a path he put you in a path he put you on a path say I want God's path not man God's path will get you where he wants you to go and don't get pulled off that path deception will pull you off that path it will keep you all set past and so you don't want that when you have clarity and discernment you will be able to recognize and identify deception and we need that right now because there's so much of it in the body of Christ and so I took that key of clarity I unlocked the door to clarity for the White House and Trump and parents and their staff to be more clearly focused on things but he's pretty focused already and he's going to get even more focused okay and you're going to him talk more about people think he's putting it on they think he's making it up talking about God he's not making up anything are you kidding four months before he ever got won the election he was hearing from every major prophet that knew what time it was okay not the ones he thought right you know get on your rapture rug you're going to be rescued you know some people still think that because they don't have revelation and they don't know what time it is but those who've been waiting for this time in God to change our nation because they knew he would change it all of them went and met with him they would prophesy to him he let them lay hands on him pray over him everybody pray he wanted as many hands and prayers that he could get because he knew he wasn't going to get that without God so he was he was already on God's team whether he sounded like nah and I tell people you can get on the foam team again in God's team because he's already on God's team okay but never in the history of our country I've ever seen people really be drawn to a candidate because they were hungry for hope and he actually had a plan no one else had the motto make America great again okay everybody was saying everything else and so now they're going to have clarity more clarity he had me declare and decree I took my king of staff I have a king staff and he said when you go out there you're going to release top and you're getting an impartation than the staff which means more of God you know get a staff this heaven culture get a staff write things on the staff hang keys and crowns on the staff you know that's not strange command it might be but not to God you know when you declared the Korean you hit that staff seals it when you hit that staff in the spirit realm it's like a shock wave because I every time I hit my staff I see a shock wave go out it increases your level of faith because you begin to actually feel what God is giving you putting into you you hear more clearly a staff was normal even back in ancient times to have and how many times to God speaks with the staff or demonstrate to that staff right parting of the Red Sea when it butted remember Aaron's Robin that was a staff how it but I mean all kinds of things he did he have salt appear on the outside of it sometimes guilty manifestations like that for you you need to get serious and show God I'm serious about doing this stuff I want to live heaven culture I want to demonstrate manners for you I want to rule and reign with Christ right now I'm so tired to end me beating me up and because we've been tolerating it we have just been putting up with it we have been participating and tolerating what the enemy is doing to us and every time you say I don't have I can't do I never will you're actually participating with the enemy because those are not God's words he has great plans for you he wants you to run your race he want you to live heaven culture you have power over the enemy to tread upon serpents and scorpions right cast out demons heal the sick raise the dead what is that stuff those are super natural powers given by Jesus Christ he gave you a deposit of anointing that he walked in on the source when you became born-again first John 2:27 look it up when you receive Jesus Christ you receive a deposit of the anointing everybody say the anointing breaks the yoke you carry that you carry a break or anointing because the anointing breaks the yoke and I says he gave you a deposit of it but you have to send it out and use it in order to get more say to get more I have to operate it the anointing was so great in Peter that it wasn't his shadow that healed people it was the anointing that it was so large outside of me like a cloud around him and it went wherever he went and when he walked with that anointing he passed people they got healed so how much more does he want us to do today [Applause] see you have weapons he gave us weapons he didn't just say well I love you you know and when you get saved people go well now you're born again you receive Christ in your heart here's your Bible I'll pray for you some churches mentor you some do I'm not putting everybody in that same off but a lot of them that's it you know come to church will welcome you here we're happy to have you here they have a place where they can hear the read hear the word of God and in the past at least it wasn't twisted so make sure you know what version of the Bible you got everybody except Adams housecat is writing a translation of the Bible and some of them aren't good and some of them aren't saved some of them weak parts of the Bible out and call it a Bible I went by one I'm not talking about the older New Testament I'm talking about they literally are taking out parts of the Bible and leaving them out because they have accountability in them they have consequences they have a protocol on how to operate they have things that are required of you they leave all those parts out the only the part about the love of God and how important special you are to God it's okay to send all you want to I know what the word says about sin you know why he doesn't like it because you don't have power over the enemy when you said Christ said I give you power over all the father said there's none of him and me and you can live without him in you trust me you don't need him anyway you don't need the devil he doesn't like you he doesn't want you kill steal and destroy is his rule that's what he lives by Christ comes to bring life and more abundantly he comes to give you authority and power and dominion over the very earth the water the land the sea all the creatures on you it's just listed ruling and reigning with Christ pushing back darkness casting out demons the kingdom of heaven shows up when you cast out demons I think that's what they said in the Bible but when you play it with a demon you can't cuss them out some people think that's really cool to do that by the way the earth itself because I've seen the future is becoming more and more spiritually oriented what does that mean that means they'll consider the spirit that they follow before they will consider men's head knowledge depending on what spirit they follow they'll live in areas where they where they operate in that spirit that's and they're kids that believe in that spirit to schools they will they're going to work certain clothing that demonstrates the images of that spirit they follow they already kind of do that because when you're a Muslim you wear the clothing that represents that image right even Buddhists you know and some of the three-stage there has I mean they do things because they're portraying an image of what they believe in so that means you need to have colored hair we're the most radical clothes take authority have power in your life you know let your soul prosper because that's his image that's heavens image and we bring life hope joy celebration a future a future the greatest future that will ever be is what Jesus Christ brings us say man and yet people need they want to make him sound like oh he was in the past you know they even water down what he did none of that is true it's an antichrist spirit anything us against Jesus Christ you could you have all different flavors of it out there but it's still an antichrist spirit anything that takes you away from Christ or water's down his authority or who he is is an antichrist spirit amen this is a day to be great I remember when he told me he told me this when I was watching something I don't know if you ever saw one time member there's some movies I'll mention because I actually watching that watch them you need to know what's in the movies before you watch them because frequency sounds and images carry spirits with them and I mean there's some really good movies even secular movies just some good ones out there that are watched they're fun they're excited and you actually learn something from it but you're not gonna learn any seeing from graphic violence sexuality profane language that's not going to cause your soul to prosper say Amen so you choose with your will what you think represents what God would want you to have because he's for you he's not against you in other words he actually is taking Hollywood so for a long time we'll have awesome amazing movies produced from there he's taking Hollywood many of them are becoming born-again they're making them change the scripts as they are filming them because they're not the same people who signed the contract see all things are possible for cotton because you know if Hollywood impact this world and they're putting out words sounds images songs frequencies and they release all kinds of things in the spirit that you don't see and people think it's all fantasy and it's not when you get things that make you feel good that make you laugh that's like a medicine so they're tweaking their movies I can tell you already they're freaking them because they're bombing some of their big big ones they want to release our bombing and they're losing money because the same moral majority that help the believers vote Trump in that same moral majority in America are fed up with the darkness in the movies they don't want to feed their kids witchcraft or demonic stuff they don't want to they don't want to feed them New Age stuff they don't want to feed them that they want them to grow up and have a future even secular of good moral secular people don't want that stuff and guess what they're the ones who spend the money it's not the few liberals and the wicked people out there that like other wickedness they do they don't they're not the ones the moral majority in America is what goes to the movies and if you make it too ugly hateful damaging then they're not going to go and there's some cartoon movies how much are they making well let me tell you I can tell you the long range of which is dark in case you wonder they're suffering at this not good and Johnny Depp played in that movie he's a great actor we need to win him to cry I actually drove I his home and release the anointing into it I just as I did I know where some of those people live in Hollywood I am bushwhacking them that movie grossed eight million and I forgot how many tens of millions it cost to make it so they lost tens of millions of dollars the same weekend they release a kid's movie which was good it made 82 million and that shows you that's the way Hollywood is going they'll make a really good superhero movie and then the next time they make it they make it darker well you're the parents of 10 11 year olds don't want it darker they like it way it was the first time they made it right and then they make it darker and then they don't take them and then it's not making as much money so I stick to Hollywood actually go in the Beverly garland theater it's a it's a theater where the movie stars go and perform and do stuff and that's where churches ric reitz churches there and you must be come to speak to Hollywood the producers director scriptwriter screenwriter special-effects people they all attend this church and I have flat tell them if you don't change what you're putting out that you're gonna lose your shirt and then this this is the floor Trump was elected and I tell them I'm telling you there's coming a time when the hand of our government will not just put extend their hand to the believer but they will become a believer and then want righteousness and godliness in our country and it's going to start changing the hearts of some people and you better start producing better movies or they're not going to come because God is about to inhabit our country and many people give us out to him and you won't have a job anymore and I didn't care what they thought about that because it's already happening I said you better treat those scriptures a whole big difference in having peril in a movie for a child and having death know three or four eyo should have to watch something killing something else okay paral paral is one thing right you know they could kind of think they would know something's going to happen but to show them that happening is unexcusable it's inexcusable and it's not acceptable by the moral majority of America nor by the believers of America and and we have a more votes than you do and we have more money than you do and if you want to sell your movies you better change what you're doing and I was just as bold to them as I was when I was because I like to go to movies did you know God loved stories if all this whole thing with Jesus happened now they'd be showing movies he'd be showing movie instead of telling parables God started all that there are movies in heaven you don't you know you don't get to you don't have to worry about any ratings oh thank god amen exciting intense funny powerful movies that you can be in the movie or watch the movie you're going to sit down and watch it you go down the hall step in the door you're in the movie acting they're called reality theaters and it's the first place they took me when it took me to happen he said we're going to show you how to have fun and I use the old thing well I have fun when I'm with you I have fun when I'm in your presence I have fun going to all these meetings I have fun listen these powerful people I have fun worshipping egos I mean fun like a child and so they took me to the fun places like jello land in heaven the amusement park in heaven where you see all the aromas and you get to learn to fly like Superman you probably know what all your kids are doing they're living out there that's the first place they could have picked any place they're taking the throne room you know they could have done anything with me no they took me to the fun places because he wanted people know it is fun it'll rock you mean fun so much fun in heaven and so you want some of those things invented and put on the earth and that awesome and I also told these actors and actresses and if you want to use your gift you've ever going to happen because in hell you do nothing okay and he'll your gift won't be recognized it won't be honored and it won't be used you actually will have no life at all and haven't you exist to live and hell you exist to die die die die die die die over and over and over and over again so you want to die all the time or you want to live that was my short version of the gospel life and death live death which one do you that was simplified didn't take me ten hours to give it to them and actually many of them are really they're cop name people I can't give you their names because they have underground churches but I mean really and God is putting believers as very close friends to some of the top stars that we have now I know one of Tom Cruise's best friends they're a prophet that is speaking into his life God gave him those gifts he wants her gift and you know I used to complain a lot about the evil the witness he goes well don't you know they have a dark heart and even though I gave him that gift what comes out of their heart is what they will produce as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so if your soul is dark are that you will produce darkness he said but if I if their one to me that same soul they'll produce amazing powerful things in the movie industry so we need to see them from God's point of view right he doesn't want them he gave them a gift every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights which is what you were before you were here why would they say father of lice that doesn't make sense that doesn't mean the stars the moon and stars know the father of light he is our Father we are his offspring that meant you are a little spirit of light when you lived in him he was your world he was your only world and you would ride out on the Rays of the rainbow you jump into different colors your favorite colors even had favorite colors when you lived in him you jump on that favorite color that bandied right out as far as it would go and then when they come back and you drive back again you rode in and out of him all the time that's why you like blue or red or green you are connected to that when you were in him and then not only back did you have color all the stones of fire that had this blue fire burning that's his passion our God is they wot consuming it really is in him it consumes when we love him that love makes that fire shoot up around those gemstones inside of him which are the stones of fire that Lucifer used to walk on he stepped inside God and led worship how close was he to him and yet he became defiled God didn't do that God did not create Satan by the way people were making why did God make evil he didn't lucifer chose to be evil he doesn't create evil same to your changing by the moment every more revelation you hear you're getting changed your soul is taking this your soul is capturing it gets recorded it actually gets stored in your soul that's why I try to share as much as I can because it's storing in your soul it will start changing the way you think it will change the way you see him and yourself you came from that holy God he was your life he sustained you you didn't have to make choices even Adam lived in there Adam was the first he sent from himself when he breathed the spirit of life into Adams body Adam became a living soul because then Adam had to make his own choices and decisions he no longer lived in him does it show you a whole different way to see life he became a living soul and that spirit of life was you that's what you were that's what he was he literally was breathing Adam spirit man into that body and that's when life begins when the spirit is attached life begins a conception at conception that father sends a little spirit of life with the Holy Spirit who goes inside the mother's womb and attaches and knits it together to that tiny dot of flesh your spirit was then attached and that's when life began and they know and your spirit is made out of light and they found a few years ago the scientist did that at the time of conception there is a flash of light and they don't know why but now you know why because that was the Holy Spirit knitting you together in your mother's womb there's revelation on the word have all that he sent you from himself to live here to have a body because you can't have authority in this world without a body that's why Satan wants to possess them he himself just can't take over he would have already done it right he needs humans to be wicked and evil and do stuff that's why God needs us to be powerful on Justin righteous because we have more power and authority than they do those operating that way don't have all the power and authority they just don't mind demonstrating for the enemy they don't mind demonstrating is about time we stood up and demonstrate for God and God said there will be people that demonstrate manifest for him so so powerfully and the way they live their life that even physical enemies will fear them because of what's controlling them will be afraid of you it says that Satan will flee from you if you resist him if you put yourself under the hand of God and you resist him by the way that is a forward motion that's you running your race that you take an authority that you live in holy that you speaking heaven culture that you making the right choices with your will your soul prospering every time you do that you're pushing him further and further away from you until you become so dangerous he runs away from you that's what a believer is supposed to look like in this world and yet we were taught just to hang on for the rapture I'm thinking if God is so Palama again eight years old in church if you were so powerful if you're all knowing if we belong to you why are we supposed to hang on hang on to what if I was to live in you I thought we had power over them as much as cast out demons what is this hanging on to get rescued rescue from who because don't we have power over the devil why are we being rescued which movie rescuers we're supposed to help rescue people to know Christ is that right [Music] this is the way people should be speaking from here this is what the church is supposed to be saying we're supposed to train you to do the work of the ministry not train you to sit at home and be in fear we're supposed to train you to take authority over the weather because we're over the weather not under the weather Christ had absolute authority over the weather and we are joined ears is that right then we should all be operating like that stop telling people those horrible tornadoes in our area you better get in the cellar I'm not telling you not to do that I'm saying as you go down there take authority over them tell them they have to stop and you you actually this is like a progressive thing but if you don't start saying it and stepping out you're not going to have Authority you're not going to have it okay what if this is how you demonstrate you say something you declare something and even God God actually says command you me that you have not because you ask not that's like basic Christianity that's your basic Kingsman that's just having your mortgage paid and getting food in your mouth that's basic asking is basic declaring and decreeing because you know who you are what he gave you it gets established to you that's not you begging for it so we need to get out a baby Christianity I I use now it's okay to ask I'm not saying don't ask if you're still learning keep asking but start declaring things like I will not tolerate a storm is coming into my area all the time and tearing up the land and destroying people's homes I'm not participating by communicating counting everybody how horrible it is I'm gonna start saying what's going to happen that's taken authority over the weather that standing in the middle of parts dry land and commanding rain to come come into low pressure system to form over the area and beginning to rain a healing rain not a destructive rain that was given to us he didn't leave you here alone when he said I will never forsake you and I will never leave you he meant that yeah but he's waiting for you to say something he's waiting to you to declare something to decree something there's no king in any nation that can rule if they don't say something they have to they have to give commands to people to have to say what they want done this is going to happen here this will go here I want this run in here start living your life like that if you have lack you're just tell lack you're not participating with it anymore take it out the door and start calling in the wealth of the wicked start calling in more than enough supply extreme extravagant supply extreme extravagant finances then when you've been saying that for a while you say I demand extreme extravagant finances to come because my god said it was mine that I'm above and not beneath and I am NOT poverty that he became poor that I might be rich so I'm calling that in right now I'm making a demand for nay not demanding to god you're releasing in the atmosphere that draws it because you're ruling and reigning I know this is going to be hard on some of you but God Himself said kamini me he didn't say beg say Amen he wants to hear you say what is going to happen when you were so full of him it comes on anyway when you share with people did you know God made everything did you know you've lived in him do you know that you want you to prosper and be in health see you're saying it already but you're sharing it when you release it in the atmosphere and you say I am calling and commanding this to come to me because God ordained me to Evon I am his son I'm not a doormat he wants me to live above so I can prosper and help people you're not hurting God you're making him happy you're making him happy she says to bless them that curse you can say a blessing or you can actually bless people instead of cursing people that says something go buy him something give it to him Wow you're going to ruin the devil's day you'll become even more terrified if you start blessing people that are against you it is fun it's an awful lot of fun especially if you if you start saying wonderful things to them while they're cursing you huh because enemy wants to shred you you want to shred you he wants to wound you then he wants you to fight back then he's controlling you and the other person but when you get to the point where you refuse to fight back because you're you you participate with them when you do that by the way you died your flesh and say I'm going to act like God right now and when they're cursing you and thrashing you did you know you're wonderfully imperfectly made you know God has great plans for you do you know you're made in His image he wants you to know him so much and they're already their minds freaking out I don't think you heard me did you not hear and yet I pictured you got picture this here's a demon sitting here saying didn't you hear me curse you didn't you hear what I said because you're saying it and they're speaking it so when you stop not letting impact you that demon is powerless and he will begin to say leave Leave leave Leave leave because you're feeling that soul that person with life and hope and the anointing that's why you said blessing not curse there's always reasons why you said things because that makes you a weapon against the enemy's plans and pretty soon whoever's doing that is either going to stop of the gunman ask you and say how can you live that way how can you love me when I have treated you that way so you spoke something you seated something into them and one day that will open the door for you to share with them this is who we are I've had to do it many times in my life I had to make all those choices myself but the more I did it the easier it got until nothing penetrated me and all I would hear was what God wanted to say to them and what I was sharing was what he wanted to say to those people and then they would get undone they would get undone I actually could hear the demons screaming that is leave Leave leave Leave leave because they didn't want that person to be filled with life we had young people pull up to the convenience store I stopped to get something in order was I was waiting in the car my sister and they were all saying something about my hair by the way which is great ministry tool they roll the vicious interchange to roll the window man that hair is hot that hair is awesome you a rock star I would you think I would usually ask them a question instead I said well what do you think it is we think this is about do you like this do you think we should all be allowed to have hair like this yeah man that's awesome I said this is heaven culture and then a shock wave sits into all of them I said I belong to Jesus Christ he likes his pink hair and then they don't say to you are that they're still all stare at me wal that I know Jesus Christ and when do you really what does he say to you oh he speaks to you I said yeah they go well I go to church so that's good that you go to church I go to happen you think you can't minister with this stuff let me tell you what then every one of them are looking at me well what does that mean that means God loves you enough to catch me up to heaven so I can tell you about it you wear clothing that makes music and change colors okay they have extreme sports in heaven and you don't even have to wear helmets I start talking about the things they like and then they're all like the ones on this side car leaning over the other ones talked to me out of the window and they said well I I think God those people I think everyone's going to go to heaven I said well you know what I know God didn't God doesn't want that because would you want to go to heaven and have all the evil and wickedness and crime in heaven well of course I wouldn't I said then the whole earth can't go to heaven I said you hear about Jesus she said you knew him right yes I know him you know he died on the cross yeah he died on the cross I said you know that gives you power over the devil then everything changed there is no devil oh no there's no devil oh no he's not real he doesn't exist now there's no devil I said but I've seen hell and then they heard screaming there is no hell they have been to the church that taught them deception oh no everybody's welcomed by God everyone's going to heaven everyone but there's no devil we don't want to hear about that might you just talk about Jesus we want to hear about Jesus we don't want to hear about the devil can you just talk about that I said no because then you're not getting truth and the truth makes you free and then they were screaming let's leave let's leave Jen and I are like holding our hands releasing the anointing we were sending so much anointing in that car the demons were running out of the car they were waiting on their friend in the store they learn he went to the store and screamed get out of here get out get out get out and I said I didn't get my IC I can't no leave it don't get have to get out here because the demons were being terrified and they were being hurt by the words of a speaking because the truth will make you free and as they took off we sent all the hosts of heaven after them to pull down every stronghold of the demonic and their life just shred the platforms anything ruling I mean we with the whole host took after and they were discovered the car bushwhack I said some Graham on heaven was praying for them generous at that we were license our wheel kindly forgot what we went there for which it wasn't that amazing was a mystery that Mississippi in which it all started because in my hair it all started because my hair they were drawn to it it says have we gone to the light they just didn't know it would be P so heaven is fun and therefore if you're going to live heaven culture on this earth you have to have fun in your life I know we're all very you know a lot of people are so serious and profound about God and he's holy and you know they for some reason they thought he never had fun I don't know why if he said you must be like little children to enter into the kingdom of so why would he think he wouldn't have fun I think he'd be in a lot of trouble if we all showed up thinking like little kids and there was no fun to be had so he planned fun on purpose and it was there before it was here it was their first kid well you making heaven sound like yours no I'm not I make an earth sound like heaven only it's better I mean can you imagine being able to ride on a dinosaur they do didn't happen they ride on dinosaurs of every kind he ever made is there the devil did not make dinosaurs okay he cannot create life he can't he creates the opposite right he's the author of gasps not lies and so yes everything everything in heaven is alive the walls your wall speak junior mansion the crystal sea has a voice the trees saying the flowers sing the flowers dance with you the birds sing everything every every creature in heaven will sing and talk to you there's a place called the friendly forest where even the pebbles will jump up and down it says The Rock's cry out in heaven they actually cry out you sit down by a big boulder it'll turn its head and again to tell you how awesome the king of glory is it's in the word it says the trees clap their hand doesn't it it says the waters rejoice all that is in heaven to imagine going on a trip on these great sailing ships that it says in the word are there it says his great great sail ships that go across the crystal sea you're not just going on a boat ride okay you're going into glory clouds the whales come up and begin to worship God the whales come up the Sharks come up they worship God everybody on that ship begins to worship the lord of glory and then he comes walking across the water and you see these blinding like a million diamonds is what Christ looks like so it's got a million diamonds it gets closer and closer to you and then he dims that glory you see him face to face and you get lost in his eyes you get lost and that passion you have for you that love he has for you and for the first time in your life you'll know why he went to the cause nothing could have kept him from that but nobody made him go there he willingly chose to go there for us that's right so we have a way back to a father who we lived in at one time every baby that passes away is in heaven every single baby whether it was abortion what it was missed with him is miscarried whatever the reason they're all in heaven he has them all okay they're also living an amazing fun life even little even little tiny babies I've seen some this big about three four inches high they didn't make it all the way through birth and he has them in heaven he holds him in his hand and they play he bounces them on his fingers they grow little flowers this big whole fields of them so these little babies can run through them and pick them and they stick them in each other's hair and they're like sticking everywhere you know they make little bouquets and go take them to Jesus they climb in the Kangaroos pockets and go for hoppy rides they write on deer they swim under the water you've got play ponds for babies they write on the turtles and the goldfish under the water they slide down rainbow bridges into the water rainbows slides they're amazing it is wonderful isn't it everybody gets their baby back when they get to heaven most of the time he keeps them very little and they'll already know you they already know you right now they declare over you right now from heaven they're in love with you they love their parents and if they were aborted they forgive their parents they forgive the people who are involved in all of that Jesus fills their heart with his love and from that moment on they want them to come to heaven amen father we declare and decree that all father who gave up their babies who didn't let their babies come to full term we declare over them God that they will have a chance to know you that they be filled with your love and your life God they'll go to heaven and the very baby that very baby you sent down to him will be given back to them God to know them to play with them God to grow into their gift into the true destiny they won't miss that God because their destiny is to use a gift that you made them to be I declare it in Jesus name Amen everything that that brings hope for people's salvation because we are in agreement with heaven when we do that you need to be in agreement with heaven says over your family amen kids have an awesome time in heaven they get to ride in bubbles they have hoverboards even at age five they hop on hoverboards and go over heaven and some adults go I'm on they're not going to get lost okay they don't even have to have an adult with them how about that they're living a life of freedom of joy creativity with God amen they're enjoying yourself they still love you every child loves their parents to them it's like minutes have gone by minutes I tell the story of the time there was a couple that I think the son was about seven and he passed away and then 20 years later his mom was on an operating table and died and was caught up to heaven and she saw him still seven playing in the streets of gold and he runs up because bomb what are you doing here see still call her mom what are you doing here she goes what are you doing she goes what do you think I'm doing I'm playing with my friends I have friends I'm playing with my friends and she was so overjoyed and overwhelmed she just couldn't take her eyes off the beauty and splendor of heaven and here he was saying I think he was even either living with a grandfather with his long he was living with a family member in heaven he said that he was having an awesome time couldn't wait for to get there but he looked there he goes but you're going back and she didn't want to go back he says you have to go back mom your life isn't over you're not done your race isn't over you got to go back and she went back and then years after that her husband traveled all over the world and told that story that you will get your children God is keeping your children they're having an awesome time you're going to get them back when you go to heaven and so you don't even miss that you know God doesn't mean he didn't take your child away from you okay he's not the author of death he's the author of life I will say this to you if they ever got a choice if they were ever given a choice and God said you can stay and here they are looking at the one that they came from and you know that was your home you know that you know he was your home you you know your home is heaven you know your home here captivated by this Living God with life flowing from him literally life coming in and out of him you know he's got eyes flames of fire and he reaches out through all that glory and just grabs you and hugs you and this is one thing you know I don't think I could exist away from him if you haven't been there I've been there I know what that feels like you're consumed with wave after wave of this living love and glory and power and revelation is flowing into you by the second just standing in front of them and you're like how can i how can I leave how can I leave and then God says I have all of your family in my hand and and if you've declared over them on the earth if they're declaring over each other they're all going to make it here because my word says if you live if you abide in me and my word abides in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you and if they're standing for each other's salvation if they don't if they don't drop them we won't drop them and you'll pursue them as much as you possibly can to get them into heaven and those kids jump into his arms and they go I'm saying so if they had to make a choice you can't don't get angry at God and don't be angry with yourself they don't want you to waste your life doing that they want you to run your race make a difference in this life do great things for him because God has you in his hand he has gum in his hand and one day you'll never be away from them amen it's a hope it's a promise he gives us I know it hurts when they leave because you have the greatest salt I ever that powerful love makes a soul tie you're still connected to them in the spirit you know but they can hear and see you by the way everybody look up to heaven away hello it says your dog draw barking at you right now yoky are you cats army Alan there is a great cloud of witnesses if I'm telling you to look up and wait every now and then you are not doing ancestor worship when you waive it one another right now are you doing ancestor worship no but religious minded people will tell you that it is ridiculous do you blow kisses because you're not worshiping each other right you're expressing love Hebrews 12:1 and he was a had just talked about the great people faith who passed on to heaven they're talking about heaven since you're surrounded about by such a great cloud of say a witness can see in here so they can see and hear you from heaven it says run your race doesn't it get rid of everything that holds you back they keep you hell down so you can run your race because you're being witnessed so don't grieve ok I command all grief to leave everybody here I come in all fear to leave everybody here I command all confusion all deception to be broken off of everybody here in Jesus name everybody say I am free I have a future he holds me in his hand I don't have to listen to the insults or judgments of man I am who he says I am I am his child I've been called greatness to run my race with celebration with joy with wealth and with help that I received amen I'm going to talk a little bit about America before I end ok America has a great future it has one of the greatest futures except maybe Israel and one you know there's two main places on this earth that God focuses on all the time one is his roar one is America and I love telling this that God said he hit us he hit us in Israel and he even wrote it down je are us a LEM he meant it when he said that to me because the USA would be friends to Israel they would partner with Israel they would pray for the Peace of Jerusalem they would support the people they would back them by saying that is their land God gave it to them we love the same God worship the same God so he actually planned this partnership before he even made this earth so we have a great destiny to be the Friends of Israel and he said he didn't replace them people I didn't even know what replacement theology was I didn't even understand that what do you mean he didn't never say he replaced him ok we are grafted in because of them we can have a relationship with the Living God amen Christ came to die for the sins of this world and then he also came to give Dominion back to us that we had the right to live a powerful exciting life in this world as a believer amen they were supposed to bring life to people and hope to people and our country has a great future and I will tell you what the father said Trump will sit in that White House for eight years [Applause] we're all those who are unhappy here in this loose it from your soul because parents will sit in the White House as president for a year it's awesome that makes a total of 16 years for him he'll be around for 16 years he already looks presidential and he is a born-again believer is boring him seho daily Bible studies in the in the White House Bible studies and prayer meetings every day they hold them in the White House not because they have to because they want to and then the person that pen sticks as vice president will be president for eight years after him yes he is letting me prophesy 24 years of righteousness in the white house [Applause] which means prosperity safety blessing increase in inventions and creativity joy and celebration in our country God welcome back to our country that we can preach the gospel anywhere we want to we won't have any problem getting permits no one's going to sue us for things they're unreasonable because justice is coming back to the Supreme Court so even in this natural realm it is going to be great to be an American and God said I want you to stop focusing on the red or the blue I want you to be red white and blue and be an American okay don't look at the parties anymore we were created to be an American live in America being born in America because of what it stands for and so justice liberty and freedom is what our name is as what God calls America America is his gift and he refuses to curse it especially since the highest position in our land is saying himself god bless america [Laughter] whoa yeah [Applause] [Laughter] integrity is coming back to our country okay and we are going to be a power overseas in a good way we are already rescuing we're going to rescue nations that can't defend themselves we're going to be able to take the gospel freely because they will welcome us because of the change in our country there will be a time when there will be no terror in our streets because the devil won't want to be here and let's all say this together the ISIS is having a crisis they better give up because he won't stop or shut up nope the enemy I'm telling you the enemies of our country are going to know they're not our friends okay those who don't want Israel that don't like Israel that don't like America they better rethink their plan because we will be the ones who will be ruling and reigning with our God in this world shaking and changing shaping nations and shaking governments amen we will shift governments [Applause] we're having an all-american rally right now that's what we're having if anyone should have an American rally it should be the church and now we actually can the unrighteous love said you could not speak from a political platform in the church he is abolishing that Trump is abolishing now [Applause] just yesterday just yesterday people if you didn't know okay that was not wanted by the people this is what how do we say is no no where do we say America is for the people by the people right so our government works for us they shouldn't be telling us what we have to do they're not a dictator a man what we vote on is what counts what we want past is what counts right and it's always going to be good it's not going to be evil right but when things are forced on you that is an illegal law that was forced upon you and no more abortion and I want you to know that I said other countries are already being influenced by our president because about a week ago the leader of Poland stood up and said we're making a new law there will be no more abortions in Poland how about that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen how about that our president made a decision and it really is inspiring other leaders of all the countries to do the same thing no fear you're right they're actually there meeting with him as fast as they can to get wisdom and counsel from him because he has he has a plan to make our country great they want their countries great and he's given them sound advice okay they've never seen anyone as bold as our president [Applause] yes he is not afraid of anybody or anything he knows God put him in that position and he knows God doesn't like evil either and so he's going full steam ahead and I tell you what he will rid the ISIS from our country and I knew all the stuff before he even won four times face to face God the Father caught me up and showed me his plan for America and he said I have chosen him before this world was made I timed his birth on the earth the generations before him lay down their life for the day of my son's power and now Trump is willing in the day of my son's power he's willing to live this is the day of by the way if you didn't know what that's not the day of his wrath Jesus Christ has a day of his wrath but he has a Dave his power that he clearly talks about praying my people be willing in the day of my power is not the day of his wrath you couldn't even put him together at the same time the Davis powers when a manifest has sons and daughters that talk about in the book of Romans will walk on this earth when the greater works that Christ said we would do will happen on this earth when the wealth of the wicked will be given to us so we can use it for him on this earth I'm not talking about in heaven I'm not talking about the millennial reign I'm talking about right now and so he had to shift our government he had to shift it so that he would be welcomed right and so that the hand of our government would be extended to the believer instead of slapped crushed down pushed back stripped God out of our country by the way that's been going on for some time because the enemy every single time he could get in to remove something of God and nobody did anything about it but tolerated it and finally for the first time the body of Christ actually did something right even before the election they all started shouting your will your way in our government today your will your way on earth as it is in heaven your will your way your choice today and the millions of the body of Christ lay down their differences and started saying that and let me tell you being needed our voice to be so we needed to say something and we needed to passionately say it and we did we did say it god bless america now that is agreeing with it we he wants to do because he clearly says blessing don't curse right and there are people saying God's going to curse America it's going to fall off the face of the map it's going to split in half anarchy is going to be in the streets everything is going to be living in dumpsters they got body bags in Missouri for all the carnage it went on and on and what that stuff is coming from hell it is not coming from God because he birthed America himself he named it for himself the very first people who led someone to the Lord in this country were the Huguenots the Prophet Huguenots who came to America for religious freedom they were called the dancing Huguenots they were prophets they would spin and dance in the streets of France how about that they came to America they landed on the shore of Jacksonville while I live and that's why I live there and when the very first converts at Tim ik want Indians were one that the gospel of Jesus Christ and that marked this land they came to mark this land for the preaching of the gospel okay in st. Augustine they claimed this land for the Catholic Church and for Spain they did not claim it for the preaching of the gospel they did not want those people here but it was too late too bad they won the first converts they want they saying the first Christian Protestant song as they were coming ashore they carried with them a monument they made in France and brought this this concrete monument and I can see that Monument anytime I want to they plan to the on the land I said we're claiming this land for the pitching the gospel for Jesus Christ and on that monument is a huge shield when Michael the Archangel holding a spirit of Satan's neck who's on the ground so there's there's a lot of open heaven over the area I actually have been out there and I actually could hear the blood of the martyrs crying out saying who will take up our banner who will take take up our calls who will continue the preaching of the gospel to win this land for Jesus Christ they had a divine purpose and they're still declaring it there in heaven but it says the blood cries out amen and so they had a purpose for America and that was God's purpose also so they came here they listen to him they came here they fought through all kinds of persecution and all kinds of things on the ocean but they came they did what he asked him to do and I'm going to own a house on that land where they came ashore one day meant I want to be where heaven came ashore and so I'm glad that I lived there but you know what God is pouring on his spirit everywhere he's got such anointed places I will tell you I do not care what they're saying and the voices of the people in Colorado I don't care what the proclaiming what they're saying is legal is illegal to God with the saying is right is wrong to God he's not going to permit tolerated because because this are going to be a region of like yeah [Applause] yeah we're in agreement with that a man you can have regions of light all over America this is part of the future that he showed me back in 1998 yeah this is how long I knew this stoppers can happen okay he sure to show me stuff in 1998 when I got baptized with fire it was powerful it burns the world out of you it will burn fear out of you it will make you bold the fire will make you bold it's hot it's mentioned in the Word of God there's one coming after me who will baptize you where the Holy Ghost and with fire and I'm telling you I haven't been the same since even since then but he began for two weeks after that happened I had open visions of the future and I saw what was going to be actually what's happening right now in America I saw that so even before the whole Trump campaign before ever that even started I knew there'd be a time that the hand of our government would be extended to us I knew they would shift our entire government and our nation and so we've been shifted okay God said I'm going to put my hand on that map and turn it red and he did he did everything he said he was going to do and if you go back and listen to that stuff everything he told me to say he's going to do it he is going to have his way this is his time when the kingdom of heaven is coming to this earth and living in us and we're living heaven culture on the earth and let me tell you your lives won't be the same again even the word Christian won't mean the same thing this is the day of his power when the generation will taste of the powers of the Millennial age and do all those powerful things that the generations before us paid a price so that we could do them a mint and it will spread all over this world because it says the knowledge of the glory will cover this earth like the waters cover the sea so none of those other nations are going to escape being touched by the Living God amen you're right all of those nations let me tell you God is definitely marked Italy I was there when he marked it he sent me to the Vatican and to do something in the spirit and he sent me to the Colosseum to declare stuff and in the spirit that was going to be there's always been a shockwave sent to that country and anytime God marks something something starts to begin you're going to see evidence in the physical realm you're going to see the enemy being stirred up because he knows his days are numbered okay and I do know this and every Catholic might shiver when I say this but there will be a time on this earth when they don't worship Mary [Applause] he told me he told me there'll be a time there'll be a pope that will have my ear and there will be a pope that declares that forever how long that lasts I don't know how long it'll last that they will not worship Me oh they'll worship Jesus Christ they'll honor Mary but they will not worship her and so there's major I'm saying major changes coming to this world major changes coming to this world I'm not saying all evil will be wiped off but it's going to be like pushed back even into certain regions where people will go just to sin or commit crimes but you'll get to choose between life or death light or darkness and so this is what we're headed you God is going to clearly define and people will know who they serve they're going to know what they're going to know who they serve and nobody will outshine the body of Christ they'll not out think out do not even in sports not in business not in any arena with a I'll do with the body of Christ we'll begin to display and manifest for God on this earth and then people will want believers as their friends instead of the way it is now people how different will be it will be drastically different and at the end of that 24 years it won't be the same country ok it will not be the same country God said people will hear the word America and they will thank God [Applause] they will think Jesus Christ helping God they'll come here to find him not that they can't find him everywhere but there'll be so much God in our country and so many believers standing up and manifesting for him that they will come here to find out what is it about that country so hang on to your hat I know this is it we're going to get on that wild rollercoaster ride but we won't be in fear of ever falling off we will enjoy the ride as something new this coming is that children will actually be honored and respected they be looked and sought-after for wisdom because God's going to give little children wisdom that even adults don't have they'll speak things and they will happen because of the purity of their hearts they won't be looked at as someone just to babysit people who take care of children will be some of the most sought after if you could prove that you who are righteous you know and you haven't committed crimes and stuff you will be paid a lot of money to watch and care for children because they will realize how precious they are how important they are to God amen I literally saw children ten years old being the pastor of huge churches because they lived righteously they can try to reason everything away that God was saying I mean mass healings were taking place manifestations of heaven were happening because children have pure hearts so they will be looked at as a soul being shaped for the future which is what they are I mean children are a blessing isn't that way sad children were sent as a blessing he would have sent them if he didn't want to if you didn't intend for them to do things on the earth he sends them he has to send them right they all live in him but his intent was to make this time-space planet he made it so he could send them from himself that's it give you another view of the earth because he wanted us to have flesh and in order to do that his son had to have flesh put on him the word didn't have flesh and yet he created everything that we see and that that we don't see he made it yet he had to walk as a human on this earth that was a big stretch talk about a stretch by the way he became poor when he left heaven by heaven standards he was poor when he left there by earth standards he was never poor what came to him to bring him the gold and all the spices and the oils it was caravans it wasn't one camel with one little package it was caravans these wise men these kings three from three different countries travelled for two years and brought all their food their tents their servants their servants food there's camel's food and they travel for two years with all the supply plus carrying wealth for the Son of God and what they gave Joseph and Mary actually could have provided for them for their entire life so when they went into Egypt they didn't have some hovel they had some of the best homes with the best tutors for Jesus to teach him they had the best garments so he was raised in that way he is the one who was living here as his father his earthly father was a master carpenter who was recognized in the city gates and remembered generations after he died is he not Jesus the son of Joseph the carpenter they didn't remember lousy carpenters back then you don't remember lousy carpenters but if somebody did a good job you always remember them because you use them over again right so even the one you gave him to train him and his gift Jesus was a master carpenter he was sought after all the time in the city especially by wealthy people because they only wanted the best carpenters to make their furniture and build their homes so you can't tell me he did not have money he was in demand he was invited to all the weddings because he always brought furniture as a gift and the water he turned into wine the wine remember that turn the water into wine it was heavens line it wasn't earthly wine it's a nice miracle to turn it into earthly mind it's a greater miracle to turn it into heavens wine so what they served at that wedding they had never had anything like it in their life it was better than I ever had before was because it didn't come from this world there's another there's another whole thing for you to see another viewpoint for you to see the whole thing the first miracle he did was he brought heavens wine to earth he still brought heaven to earth for a party amen so Sistina I'm going to declare Oh everybody and then we're going to end ok I will be back I'll be back yes when God offers you something you should always say I receive it and let me tell you why you should say that because he writes it down when you say that he records all the time he records your words amen you're moving and when you get to heaven you will know everything you helped to change throughout your lifetime you know every person you impacted every nation everything that went on you know how many times you stopped hell ok you beat up hell with your words you just you went every every time you choose God over hell every time you choose what's right all of heaven celebrates so you cause heaven to celebrate you cause hell to cry you terrify their enemy you get him upset he thinks you're nuts because he can't figure you out in other words you drive him not that that's why we should take seriously what he says in the word right declare and decree it will be established unto you right you're over the weather you have authority over the weather over the earth itself over the atmosphere you change the atmosphere with your words you create the atmosphere in your home a habitation for heaven - you do it yourself by the choices you make with your will because your soul is powerful even as your soul prospers you will prosper and live in health so there is a requirement people I remember everybody would say Oh God wants us to prosper the word says he desires above all though we prosper but they never said what was required and so I turned that around even as you hear the requirement first even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in hell that's a lifestyle so we can be rich because it became poor we can be in help because our soul prospers every time he said there would be that is a state of existence so your will be done on earth that is in heaven is a state of existence yeah that's heaven culture amen so you be hearing more that but I'm going to declare a blessing over everybody here Amen father I choose as an act of my will father operating in the authority you gave me then I'm going to clear freedom freedom hope liberty justice for every wrong gun to them justice over injustice father I declare restoration for all their families for their jobs for the well restoration in their help god I speak against every spirit of infirmity every spirit of sickness every spirit of disease every spirit of any care father that is not having culture so come against it right now I pull down to the hosts of heaven i commission pour on the stronghold of sickness of disease of infirmity father pull it down for them shred it crush it I seek liberty freedom health wholeness and void and everybody's body and your mind and your motions and Jesus name I declare it say I receive it amen amen [Applause] and father I declare the over everybody watching God everybody receiving a God let it be important them I declare over them I blessed him with it father I thank you in Jesus name everybody said yes amen yeah God hallelujah

flowing through for so many years Lord in this hour the things that you're showing her and the things that you're doing in and through her the things that you're unfolding inside have changed the world has changed the way you do things have changed the way we wore and changed the way we pray the revelations of just of you Lord in Revelations in heaven I've changed many of our broken hearts as we understand the greatness of heart we are grateful for bringing you we thank you for the things that you're doing deep inside of her and you've been doing deep inside of her for this point in time this divine time in Colorado for all those that have come through others from other states and even at some other nations yes other nations Canada we ask that you would just help us all to put aside everything of this day any weighty things any things that have happened in this day and Lord we're here we've made it and those that are watching by livestream the same those are watching by Facebook live just go into a place of just but aside everything that you were here that we will hear clearly what you're saying to us the church in this hour for those that don't know you Lord that you're gonna speak to them specifically today and that you will reveal heaven to them in a way they have never seen or known or really thank you that you will be honored Lord Jesus Father that you will be honored and you precious Holy Spirit you honored father son Holy Spirit honored tonight so we thank you now Lord and we give you the glory for what you're about to do now in Jesus name Amen David shared about the baskets yes for the way we do some special offerings here what we're gonna do is if you would when you have something that you really love and you really want to sow into just make your way down here and just put you put your offering right in the baskets it's okay cat she won't be she won't be moved one way or another and we learned that from the Africans years ago that you know when they're dis when they when the Lord would just put something on their hearts that would just bless them so much they said I wonder deposit in I don't want to receive that offering I want to receive that blessing that came from that so that's what the offering so we're gonna just a that's gonna be the offering tonight so you guys just come on we're gonna bless her we're gonna bless her mightily we thank you all for coming and sister we are ready both barrels okay love you cat good to have you welcome everybody welcome cat [Applause] well welcome amen um can you hear me yes somebody put it on whatever I'm real excited I always love coming here the atmosphere is so powerful you know I'm I'm telling you there are so many so much of the Angelica's around here always but there's always an increase and that is a good thing when I come back to a place and there's an increase and heavens armies or even just game roles and messengers describes the couriers you know as is that me making that sound oh tight what my mind disconnects oh it's okay I'm when the 15 it really doesn't matter you never had privacy in your entire life you knew it was never gonna be about you trust me just surrender and love them all in the middle but they do it yet and when you learn to do that really your life is gonna be so simple because you're not everything to be concerned of what people think about you is that still me is that my scarf how's that yes okay yes yes well one day I'll be standing up here speaking and then I'll be gone but I'll be right back the father's really been showing me a lot about the greater works and really what a true manifested son and daughter is and why did he even pick those titles he didn't want to call you you know it's not that you're not someone's husband or wife or family member but but the father sees us always as his sons and his daughters that's why when you go to home to heaven you get your own mansion just don't say no okay you will love it you'll be undone and you know what your family can come stay with you for a while then you can stay in theirs and and people do that a lot in heaven you know they just go visit each other's mansions even if someone's gone just go on in heaven and have a wonderful time there because no one's gonna care they're not worried about their stuff being stolen or taken or damaged they're so free and heaven I think one of the earmarks of heaven culture being lived on the earth as we will feel that free about things and though in the realms that we live in I'm you're gonna hit me say realms and zones a whole lot because that's how the father talks to me they don't have like areas or districts or you know they don't have like earth titles in heaven but heavens about to send a lot of those titles and positions down here and so the territory in heaven is marked out by zones and realms and realms can be layered if you've never heard me talk about the father and even the way he may mean I'm making this remark because of an email i got i don't usually even get to see them because there's like thousands of them that come to me but i just happened to see me laying there and it was to me and i read it and they totally didn't understand even about the soul that it's made it is in three parts god has made your entire being in layers your body has layers your spirit man has layers and your soul has layers because god's not just up you know one level one whatever god he's he's always deeper and has more things that he releases into us and ways to use us and so he didn't make you just like a block of wood it's the best way I could describe he didn't make you you you're not made just like in one way you have so many parts in you that when you really begin to connect with what each one of those mean and how to use that you will become more more powerful in him he'll be able to do more with you and for you so just want to encourage people step beyond your head knowledge when you're when we're talking about spiritual things because even the spirit realm itself has layers I'm here to do spirit round boot camp hey what is that something you've almost known nothing about your entire Christian life unless you yourself are a seer or you have a maybe God has shared deep understanding of what the spirit realm is but I've been in and out of that it's probably more than even around on the earth even on the roads and highways I mean we have roads and highways SPMS roads and highways and has waterways that has Airways frequencies light you travel on light in the spirit realm but if you could see like super highways going like this everywhere all the time intertwine we sometimes in spirals someone's like that and like sheets of light coming down and taking you places there's more activity in the unseen realm then there is in the scene realm because it is the original realm you're in a temporal realm but you're a supernatural being as a new creation you know one day our bodies will be glorified you'll go from mortality to immortality if you don't know what that means that means you can never sin never die never get sick never fall from from his from the position God's given you and nobody can take anything away from you that like on the earth God says watch out for your crown that no man take it from you so I'm just gonna I'm going to drop little scriptures in between while I'm talking here tonight but I'm really here to let you understand how real that realm is to me it is more real than the natural realm heaven itself is a spiritual world wrapped any spiritual realm but spiritual beings living there it is a literal realm it's the only way you can say it you can't say it's a physical realm you know you can't say that it is a literal realm when you live a real life like you really go into your mansion you touch the walls you sit on the furniture you know ride on beams of light around heaven create rainbow bridges by shouting glory to God across a crystal sea you you travel on light frequencies color billions of the rainbow God sends himself to come and get you twirls around you and brings you back to his throne to spend time with him it's a different way of life heaven culture is totally different than the way we live here because we're living below what he always intended us to be and do and if we keep remaining disconnected from that spiritual place on the unseen place this is the time on earth where the unseen will be seen and not just by the body of Christ but by those in the world all over the world and I have news for you the knowledge of the glory will mostly go through the spirit through the spirit realm travel in and out instantly be somewhere go share release and power people then step back and be somewhere else in a few more seconds that's what the Angels do if they're sent on an assignment takes like three seconds are done it can be somewhere on the other side of the world instantly they're there they'll deal with the army of darkness you know bash them really crush them throw them in a dry place shred platforms they've been ruling from for years pull down strongholds and 3-seconds be back because the reason why we need to be connected or at least start with an understanding that place is real it's a way of life it does not belong to Satan or the New Age movement 4 years old we heard about was you know the New Age movement doing this and that and things would appear and disappear and they would shape-shift and go places and that's just mocking what God has always intended us for us to do but for good the disciples did it it's part of heaven and we all say Heaven's coming to earth what does that mean that means your life's gonna radically change many things are going to end in your life and you're gonna be done with them because the more the old you get rid of your habit your thoughts and your mindset that through man's traditions we have adapted to it because it's comfortable I do not ever want to be comfortable again I don't want to be boring nor do I want to be bored so the body of Christ is lacking heavily an understanding of that unseen realm but they know it's there so God's giving detailed revelation what is it how do we operate in it what does it look like what does it do to this physical realm where does this talk about that and the word what did Christ do in that what are the Angels doing that what does war look like in the heavenlies the heavenlies isn't talking about the sky over your home they warn that unseen place okay this physical realm is wrapped around the spiritual round not the other way around it's wrapped around it because it's temporal it's like you it's like you had this beautiful home perfectly built and amazing but you put a cover over it and yet it was yours you owned it it was yours you had the Builder you have it living it use it enjoy it be blessed by it and yet we're only seeing a covering like what we have now is like owning a tent because it's not a true true picture of what God has prepared for us to have to own to operate with many places like in heaven when you die and go home to heaven you don't get one mansion Jesus didn't say you get one he said there are many many many many many many more than I could ever count I've seen a mansion several now they're the size of a whole city like the city of New York order the city of Atlanta anywhere one mansion and all that property everything on it belonged to one person probably probably one of those grandma intercessors you don't really know what she did in that closet they're probably times when she wasn't even there she looks we think ah she just stays in that closet she probably wasn't in the closet especially if you pray in tongues a lot there's a clue for you the unknown language for the unseen realm they kind of go together don't they Satan hates that language he's trying to crush it you know wipe it out wrongly accuse that wrongly accuse us we're doing it because he's terrified of it he can't understand it he doesn't know what you're saying he just knows it's dangerous against him it's part of the spirit realm heavenly language heaven unseen realm a heavenly language the unknown language in the unseen realm where the devil does not like it it's always gonna be bad for him when he hears people praying it because it's the perfect prayer why because you're totally agreeing with what's in that spirit realm and the unseen around with the unseen beings who were so powerful God's unseen plans for us who are his new creation won't be gonna when you begin to pray that passionately and fervently you move things and shift things in the spirit one that will then shift things in the earth we need to really see that this is it's a real is something that's real you mean of you know touch it but sure can feel a sometimes can't you I've been talking a lot lately I think I think I've had like 80 meetings this year I probably got a lot more before the end of this year because people are finding out there's something new in the earth it is self is not new more ancient than we ever will be I love hearing people talk about having encounters like tonight about people seeing the squirrel room in heaven and or the mantle Hall of Mantle's God names everything he loves she named things when you go home to heaven you get a white diamond not a white river rock with a new name written on it did you say a white stone that's a gemstone yeah we get one and he's writing this new nickname he has for you that only you and he know when you come home to heaven he gives it to you but that's a white diamond and every syllabus I've ever seen that talked about that it was like a nice little River Rock no it's not upon this rock that's the rock of Revelation the rock of love those are gemstones that's what's inside the father the stone of fire are in him that's why he is a consuming there's much of the word that actually confirms itself if you just read a few scripture that doesn't make any sense to you find the ones that connects with and then you get revelation out you go why you see it so plainly and clearly but you have to pursue that so the one thing the father even says that the body of Christ is lacking is is understanding of the unseen realm even though he said everything that is seen was made by that which is unseen so we should have been pursuing what is that unseen what does that look like what goes down there you'll find out when you go to heaven someday maybe he won't die to go there somebody should be saying Amen God is no respecter of persons Elijah and Enoch look more amazing than anyone I've seen in heaven and look how long they've been there in their bodies you hear them before you see them that you hear the frequency of the glory they carried you hear it you hear them before you see them everyone in this room has a frequency you decide whether the volume goes up or down every plant every animal has frequencies in them the enemy can also hear these frequencies say they're unseen say it loud they're unseen but they impact things so you need to learn how to turn your frequency up some people may be sitting going where is this coming from I've never heard of anything like this before my life but it's in the word it's in the word how many people this first time you've ever heard me speak okay well help them Jesus and I hope you like pink hair because it's heaven culture say on earth as it is in heaven I need to think about changing my parents to line up with having culture we will be some of the most radical people in this earth in the past I know God hid us I was hidden for years and years and years I had all kinds of encounters did things new things but he hid me he wasn't letting me say anything to anybody and I didn't have a problem not saying anything if he's asking you to hide something don't say it but he's asking you to say it don't hide it right obedience is very key in this time and I know a lot of scriptures to talk about obedience especially the joy of obedience yeah when you hit the joy of obedience there's no longer consequences if you disobey because disobedience isn't in you it's not in your soul there's not there's not a place in your soul for sin for a fence for disobedience because the new creation is like Christ say Amen you have to stop letting the devil push us around and telling us who we are he knows full well who we are and he's terrified of us and I don't remind I don't mind reminding him of that he even tries to say something to me ago you are just revealing the fact that you're 10 purified or you'd be trying to make that statement to me that you know I'm not receiving it don't waste your time we should speak both II for God and you might you can speak boldly even in a quiet voice that doesn't mean everyone has to be sound like me but you need to live like I live you want to be free of everything if you want to be victorious if you want your soul to prosper if you want to live in divine health if you want to not be attacked by the enemy I live heaven culture I've been doing it now every single day of my life for four years and my life changed when I started doing it because what God is bringing to this earth is not another revival man has always controlled the revivals when they first started they were powerful you know why it was all God they would let him have his will his way and that's why it was it would be extreme sometimes and the manifestations of the miracles and the things that happened and to me and started getting their hands all over at they thought they could make it better or they could make it happen here but not over there then we want to do this and change this and pretty soon it was like gone it did a lot of good while I was there but man can get their hands on something that happens in a specific place if it only happens in a place in a certain building or in a certain piece of property or even in a certain city like Toronto or Brownsville or Lakeland those who are areas that were saturated with the revival and every one of them ended by getting their hands on and yet what's gonna happen now he's not a revival it's much better he's not reviving something old but he will build on it he's not wiping it out like it never happened but some of those people who did that they're in heaven are waiting on their rewards by the way we live our life down here what we're getting habitation revivals em they ever you know they flow the Evan fold in flow and then they go a habitation builds and builds and builds becomes more apparent more seen by people more understood sought after what is this your life is changing why are these amazing things why is the glory all over your home why can I see it driving down the road three miles from your home why does he flames the fire on you when you're walking around well you just got up why are there flames of fire on the seat you just sat on because you're inhabited by the glory we will wear the glory like a garment I used to tell Jesus I want to wear you like a garment see I never said anything normal my mom told me every day my life I was strange you are so strange I don't know what God will do with you and whatever he wants to when you're part of a tribe of 15 you want to be different over just tell him I want to wear you like a garment I'm putting you on right now and I will just go out you know but I caught Jesus and I would think his thoughts and and run after his ways and then it began to not be able to take him off he wasn't just a garment anymore it was the glory and that glory builds it says we will shine like the stars in the heavens it said even the night will be light running about you yes that's exactly what that means it is a spiritual substance from the spirit realm from a spiritual God for his spiritual Kingdom but if we don't even know what that means how can we run after it because we've heard forever and ever and if say it forever and ever and ever we have gotten our three scriptures or two song and went home totally unchanged but that's not what you wanted he said we go from glory to glory to glory that does not mean from the glory to the pit the glory to the pit where am I going the glory to the pit know where the glory to the pit that's not even that's not a witness that's certainly not a good testimony and I know that the word says you overcome and the word of your and love unless oh I love that part from my mama her friend sitting over there and she said hello to you she loves you my mama just went to Saskatchewan Canada with me yeah she had a lot of fun she's praying for people couldn't help it she's talking next moment I see her laying hands on people bringing from home what you're supposed to be enjoying and relaxing she goes I am so we have to understand really who we are you are a spiritual being you always have been before the earth was made you were in him you didn't have a mansion in heaven to live and he didn't say you know he didn't say way back when you had a mansion we lived in and there's nowhere in the violets who actually lived on the earth in a different body you didn't have a body you couldn't have lived on the physical earth without a body and had any kind of authority or do anything because this is a physical realm and if you don't have a body you have no authority here if the devil that were true that you had authority in the spirit and your spiritual body the devil would have totally taken over and wiped out anything he could that was left of God but he can't do that that's what he wants us to come us and then he inhabit us and then he has a body there are no zombies I hope that doesn't disappoint you no aliens no zombies people keep me emailing me the craziest things I don't know where the aliens are except me right here if you believer you are also an alien we are the aliens that's in the Bible to Raelians we're not on this world we're in this world a temporal world don't cry when he folds it up like a garment what's gonna happen to me where will I go who cares you were the one who made the first one I think I would trust him to make the new earth where he will climb on the New Jerusalem and move from his home called heaven to live on the new earth with all of us together it will be our home he's even willing to give up his home his house his house is the world called heaven a spiritual place it's good to know about spiritual things and someone although that word in today's world could mean many things even the word faith could mean many different things so heaven culture they can't take that away from us they don't even know what that is they don't even know what that is the devil had no idea that one day we would be living on this earth like they live in heaven free from him free from fear free from black free from sickness disease free from aging I receive at people like there that is nowhere in the world you need to read it more than because the last age and this earth before he folds out all the way will be the Millennial age when Christ in his glorified physical body super glued to his spiritual body I told me that's what immortal means no more mortal flesh it's immortal flesh and Christ looks amazing in his immortal body he will sit on the throne in Jerusalem for 1,000 years on this earth so don't believe people they say the end is here and we're leaving the earth is going to explode by Planet X I don't even know what that is is something out there in space they found it and then what no that's not in the Bible for right now you know I'm not what do you do about Planet X I'm nothing I'm gonna go shopping after you buy my clothes so I'll go speak bar places I am NOT concerned about the CERN you probably don't know who they are you don't need to heaven is not concerned about the CERN or the Nephilim or planned attacks not even the rapture which will be a celebration not a rescue party if if that was gonna be a rush key parties say until I come back hiding in the mountains and eat the worst thing you've ever had in your life c-rations preach the gospel to the raccoons and the bears but don't go out because it might be dangerous no he didn't say that he never told you to even be concerned about the rapture he doesn't even know according to the word Jesus Christ does not know when the rapture will take place you know why because that's not on his priority list right now ruling and reigning commanding the hosts of heaven crushing the planes of darkness pushing back create regions of glory handling the wealth of the wicked of this world being the heads of all the seven mountains being out front not behind being accelerated to the front of the pack where people will know you and want to know you and see you and want to know what you have to say in other words I said he's not hiding you anymore he's going to reveal you like a fine painting that he's been working on for years even when you thought you forgot about you you got stuff spilled on you was a mess it looked like a big mess that was buried under stuff no the whole time he was working on you knowing what you would become one day for him so we're pretty much like wrapped around a big art gallery right now on the earth she's about to reveal some of the greatest paintings he's ever made that's us and we won't be able to hide I love what he said to me when you've stepped into this new time and you're running after it you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape being great so if you want if you want a prophetic word there's your word you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape being great what do you think the greater works are because people go it doesn't say that in the Bible do you realize in your manuals for to operate your microwave it has more than five words printed on a page and the Bible also does not talk about microwaves we may have find out they're not so good but we've been using them is that true most of what you have our own isn't mentioned literally in the Bible it says knowledge will increase it says things will be created in the earth there be greater works than ever before even greater than Christ did that that when a manifesting sons and daughters walk upon the earth the earth itself will be healed by the glory that's why the earth is in travail it doesn't mean the end and it means the end of the way we've all been living way below what God wants us to and so why does he say be great because you will be known and seen operating in power and authority really to the point where Satan flees from you because you've submitted yourself under the hand of God and you are resisting him with your forward motion in the kingdom instead of hiding sitting down hoping nobody sees you or knows you get over that because he's gonna pick people out in front he wants you to stand up and stand out why because Satan's been doing it for generations he's been showing up who he is all the people he's marked and he's used they don't mind showing off so God the habitation will be a show case you wondered the biggest show on earth is about to be played out on this earth by us because we are his sons and his daughters he had the first big show it was held in heaven when he kicked out Satan and all one-third of the angels that was a show they were celebrating trust me they weren't crying Lucifer decided to take over they were so fed up with him by the time God kicked him out they were celebrating the other angels the Fallen ones may have been crying I'm sure they thought they were gonna win just like this last election deception deception can deception will deceive the deceiver those who were used to spread lies yes I'm going to the political platform God is very political God has his own parties called the holy party they have a platform crush the darkness and rule and reign push it back don't tolerate it don't participate it don't participate with it be a new creation shine like the stars in the heaven that's their platform I want that one it's light not darkness all those angels thought they were going to win because God had said nothing the whole time Lucifer was deceiving them he let every single one of them be tested they only got to choose once out of chose real carefully they can't repent and they can't go back he will not take them back they live with him they believed a created being over the Creator where they had been with him if there was time it would have been ages they knew who God the Great Creator was they knew who the word was they knew who Holy Spirit was they knew they were in charge and this this being thought he was taken over and he he actually convinced them that he was because God would say nothing the whole time he was doing it that's God's mo share my will my way show my plan sit back see what happens Darden showed up he kicked it out he was cleansing heaven forever and they cannot repent they cannot ever go back to him they were unseated and lost their place because they chose deception and the thing about deception is if you've listened to it long enough you will actually enter into it and then you will try to deceive people with the same deception you got and you can't tell people they're deceived unless there's a divine intervention unless there really is a divine intervention or they have an encounter with God if they've been living that deception so long and saying that non-stop every time they say it it goes in their soul it convinces their soul even more it filled their soul filled their heart their mind everything they thought about was the deception then they acted it out by talking about it and rebelling against what was truth and it happened so much in this last election never have I ever seen the soul show up that was deceit and they don't know what to do they don't they don't know how to go back many of them can't go back they can't even be who they were before because when your soul gets filled with it you become that and they still can't get it I recently was in five different countries international countries and while I was there none of these people knew me that approached me but they figured I was an American when do I and they all asked me the same question what do you think of your president and I knew it was in her thoughts already knew they were for him not against him but they didn't tell me that I said I won't tell you what I think I'll tell you what 80percent of America things I said we love him we back him we believe that he really cares we know he's gonna make changes because he's already already created a million jobs in less than a year and so he's really proven and gods actually gonna have me give him that message I just gave you sent it to his son Donald Jr tell your father this is what God says about him you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape making America great and it will be sighed the Living God because he's running after it fiercely running after him regardless of the mum barment sand the words that have come against him he won't let it penetrate him he won't let it touch him and and other leaders of other countries are taking notice because these five international people they were like one was a medical moments a surgeon him and his wife were both brain surgeons I think they had lived in Canada but they had just been in the Middle East getting more training and I was on a tour bus in Italy and he told his wife I'm gonna go sit by her she said okay she must be used to it and he was the first one who asked me that Elmo would you mind tell me what you think about your president and I could see his wheels I see like little flags on Trump Trump Trump Trump in his mind like I guess yes because I look pretty happy and that's what I told him I'll tell you what 80percent of America thinks that I am I said they have lied the other side the liberal media have lied from the very beginning because they were controlled by the enemy and darkness they didn't want God anywhere they wanted somebody and even even some of the Republican hierarchy that have been around for a long time have controlled for years years and years and years control they want someone they could control and the same thing of democratic said they didn't want someone who could run over them or beyond them they want a puppet so God needed someone who was not a puppet and I'm actually telling this secular person this I'm telling what God said about him he was loving it well I'll tell you right now we like him we were rooting for him all along and I said he said I don't usually pray I was really praying he would win [Laughter] and he said he said I had to ask you because what we're hearing on the news it just doesn't line up because the people are always still there whatever he goes that people are there and when he's reporting on his own public Facebook page which they all watched then he went there to find out what was really going on and their armies meticulously was about letting the American people know what was going on and he said we were really for him he said I have hundreds of friends and we were all kept having conversations about him saying why are they saying he's losing why are they saying that that doesn't even make sense in our head when we see the rallies and we see tens of thousands of people there and the other side had a handful if they had if they have one and I went because they were afraid they're afraid of somebody who really would get something done and that would do what the people wanted done because it's for the people by the people and I said and he's a people I said he's a people he's not a politician so he was overwhelmed and overjoyed he said I know even when I was in Canada they were all talking about him because they said whatever happens in America happens in Canada I just got back from there they are still cheering him on they want a killer to become like America now they want Canada to be free to be prosperous did not have liberality on every single street corner crushing the rights of believers or just everyday people they were saying just everyday people you know they don't have a life it's controlled so they're all praying that other the one out of there or else he gets changed and let me tell you they have behind the scenes people who are grassroots strong believers coming up in that line and I actually might driver what I was there was one of those people who has actually already run one one of the minor elections and his goal is to become Prime Minister strong strong strong believer he has a huge following and again it's almost the same there that the news that our theater spirit is not telling the truth and so let me tell you they're running after God being in their country so they kept prayin you know the leaders are praying trumpet when yet the businessman was also kind of praying he would win because they have big business deals with our country and they want businesses left to do business with and so it was really strange that I have one ask you in in Spain and France in Germany and Canada someone from London it was and they all asked me the same thing in different places on different days but when they started looking at me one here comes the question and they all said what do you think about Trump I mean I think God chose him I think God appointed him I think he anointed him I think he's gonna do exactly what God wants and I'm just letting you know to have some good news he'll be there for eight years and then pants and then whoever pence picks will be there for eight years so I will tell you from the Creator the heavens in earth there will be 24 years of righteousness in the White House and I said whether you understand what I'm gonna say this is a spiritual war a spiritual battle not a natural battle this is a spiritual battle because it's very clear to see there is good there's evil there's darkness there's light but in this time light winds I said God you made this earth has a plan for this earth and this habitation he's bringing I don't care who they are and you would not talk to them the habitation is coming of God in us being seen around the world new creations like fuel from outer space that will cost almost nothing then they were really getting excited I said many new inventions would she say for this very time that we're living in you will see them happening and so then if you can ask people what are those inventions they didn't care who it was they didn't care if I was preaching the gospel town about Jesus you know why because hope was in that message but every one of them as same question I said well this is God's time this is why it's happening I know anyone but this is God's plan do you find people in leaders who can't be bought sold shaken or used that actually want justice and freedom and some of them may be believers some may not be believers but I really believe God's gonna get them in the end there has to be a time when this earth is experiencing that and the gray area says there is no God is erased and sometimes you'll just use secular people people who are not believers but let me tell you if they still hang around long they're gonna become one so we as believers even more than the world should understand there is a spiritual realm there is unseen activity from both sides in that place is actually unseen buildings and properties that are created in the spirit realm to be used as Satan uses song the host you some the Gabriel's group uses some of them and that activities always happened but in this time we're gonna begin to see it and you actually drive into an area and you'll feel God you feel his presence so powerfully sweeping to your car sweeping to you sweeping to the office where you're working because a region of light is being created in the area because of the habitation of our God in us because Christ in us is the hope of glory that's a powerful statement but understanding what that means is even more powerful and the wonder of it all and she doesn't really care about your education or your age even where you live what color your skin is what kind of food you eat or don't fit or don't eat you know and I'm just gonna give this from heaven for free on trial the Holy Spirit says this tell them that you don't have to be baptized in the Holy Spirit or baptized in water or go to church every single day of your life or necessarily even pay ties that is not those things won't take you to hell but those are being preached you give because you want to give when you give it shall be given unto you when you honor the Lord with your 10percent he'll do more that 90percent probably double it triple it than you ever could do with that 100percent it is a blessing and an honor to give and in these days you really be glad you did even if that was in the past you'll be so glad you did that because you were feeding for your future wealth it is one of the signs of the kingdom age being on the earth and how many times did Jesus even acquainted to money or wealth or gems because it was that valuable and he's trying to get that message cause you know is the value what if you find a pearl of great price you sell everything you have that means you up surrender whatever is getting in your way lay down your mindsets your your anger issues your whatever your own what do you think is gonna happen your assumptions lay them down and run after that pearl of great price run into the kingdom go forward ruling reign with Christ in this time and years that God actually created this time there were Scrolls of time opened in heaven in 2012 I've seen many Scrolls in heaven I've seen angels bringing Scrolls when actually brought one to me my husband was with me and dropped it in my spirit that was not strange to me because it's a spiritual thing for a spiritual Kingdom for spiritual time on the earth and what the scroll was talking about was about operating with the hosts of heaven as one of your greatest weapons and it does change your life and the mindset of the traditional legalistic or religious God didn't create religion however God did use that for a time he did when it was all he had on you that he could use he did but he wants a relationship and your relationship with him will determine how far you go to become a priest a Lord or a king those or eternal positions also given and worked out and ruled with in the spirit realm there are spiritual crowns their spiritual Mantle's being given out right now they'll all have to do is ruling and reigning and people say it doesn't say to the Bible oh I don't have time anymore to try to explain to you just go start looking for it he has a kingdom he invited us into his kingdom nothing could stop it from coming nothing can stop the habitation of heaven on this earth and everybody who was a believer from the time jesus said pray this way has been calling it in in the spirit with a frequency in their voice they knew that was a word they knew the Lord had said to say that that was a safe scripture in red and so the ones that are brother they really say a lot well that was Jesus's playing all along he highlighted it he knew they say it regardless of the battles of the denominations or the non denominations or the inter denominations he knew that he could get them to agree on that scripture calling in one of the most important times on the earth called the kingdom age where we will wield crowns and be kings and priests unto our God spiritual kings and priests to a spiritual King and priests so important was it to Christ that he wrote that time on his very being I am the king of kings and the Lord of lords those are spiritual positions of authority extremely important to him because that meant those people understood there was a spirit realm it's where we all came from on the inside of us we are a spirit and have a spiritual body that gives us absolute authority and Dominion through Jesus Christ over any demon any power of Darkness no matter where it is what it is one is doing it we have power over it and those went after it and they made a huge difference their lives begin to change that's cut manifesting for Christ but when people start disappearing and coming back in front of you and angels are with them at their side holding gifts for everybody who is present God loves to give gifts he's your father one of the number one things they do all over heaven is give gifts and they're tangible gifts they're not just something that floats around heaven is a tangible literal world where you have real mansions and beautiful amazing things to have and to give away to people and your loved ones have been getting a gift every birthday you've ever had since you were apart putting it in your mansion until you have your welcome home party one day gives her everywhere because people use their gifts every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights those lights were you before you came here God is he says don't let your hide under a basket but let your shine those are spiritual things all of them accept the gift he's talking about your natural gift that he put in you that you can use right now on this earth because in heaven you will use it all the time your passion your greatest delight your pleasure whether it's a baker or you hold rodeos antique car shows whether you create amusement parks whatever your natural gift is if you're an interior designer a fashion designer a jeweler all these wonderful amazing things that we wouldn't have anything in this room if those people didn't use their gifts athletes have gifts actors and actresses screenwriters script writers special effects people you don't know what special effects are do you see a movie in heaven they don't even have to give them ratings because none of them are rotten because the minute I say that in persons human mind in your national mind ago they would not show movies in heaven why not like they have down here you didn't write those scripts but when you operate with your gift and there's light in your heart then what you produce will be light whatever gift he gave you if there's darkness in you guess what you're gonna produce out of you darkness dark movies dark music dark images on everything out there the marks of the enemy on everything his words being you'd everywhere because those people are filled with darkness but God gave them that gift he made them that gives you corrected me he made them that gift he made them that gift that's why people are drawn to them that in these days they're gonna be drawn to your gift when he said your gifts will make room for you and bring you before great people he's not talking about being an intercessor he's not he's talking about your natural gift if you're an artist if you're an electrical engineer if you know hi-tech and how to put it together create amazing things that gift that you dream about think about probably knew what it was when you were a child and you kind of just let it fade away because you were so busy being what people said you should be every single person has one or you are one that's why he says every good so it said there's not rotten movies in heaven every good and perfect gift no matter what it is you want to do on the earth creep if you could do and make a living that's your gift if you could do it your whole time and make good money doing it because you love it you're blessed by it you're passionate about it a photographer I'm a photographer button I'm always a little I knew I know I'm being a Revelator right now but in heaven guess what I'll be a photographer and I will be excited because it is my passion I collect old SLR cameras you know what that is single lens reflex that means there's nothing what do you call that nothing automatic about it every frame you have to set the frame the light meter you have to focus every single picture you take make sure there's enough light it's in focus everyone and I love it and I'm good at it because it's it's me I am a photographer it's my passion it's my sister's passion my brother's passion we have a bunch of in our family I love photography where would be without it right we wouldn't have any visual anything no matter what form of media you use it in you know when someone has a gift and someone doesn't have a gift I have a guarantee I never had any classes I can stand in front of anything for five hours and take so many different images of that using light the texture the definition the depth of the different lights that are in there the colors are in there or even the materials that is made out of whether it's rough or smoother or soft or you can change it by putting light on it it fascinates me because I'm a photographer so when you feel that way about things that's your gift that's you every good and perfect gift so when we use that gift even is to give it away it blesses God if we use it just to help people maybe it's not what you do for a living but in this time of year things are going to change because living heaven culture get this the difference about being living on earth as they do in heaven they use their gift so if we're gonna live on earth as they do in heaven we will begin to use our gift and actually make money for doing it because God's gonna highlight that gift it'll be amazing he'll make sure it gets out there and it will draw people to you because of the gift can you see that there's some people if you make something so amazing you're really good and amazing they don't care whether you know Jesus Christ or not but they will come and seek you out because of the gift they will make room for you and take you before great people it is so major to know what your gift is even in the spiritual world called heaven they use that gift so we have to have more understanding of what and the word is talking about spiritual things this is one more thing I'm going to talk about I don't even know what time it is in the word this written they were the word that we read all the time hopefully I was fed it like baby food some things he's talking about our spiritual places or physical places some things he's talking about our spiritual things or physical things some our spiritual activities some our physical activities so you need discernment with all you're asking for everything else why not ask let's stand up and do it he said make him do it you're gonna ask for supernatural discernment it will open up the word it will give you greater understanding it's wonderful to sit in here all this but wouldn't it be wonderful if he just gave it to you yourself because we're coming more aware of the spiritual realm and this earth itself would begin to focus on whole lines of apparel the way they build buildings even neighborhoods even schools will be built because of the spirit they follow or worship or practice so we absolutely don't want to be left behind the rest of the world okay we have we should have a greater understanding of spiritual things than this secular world so we're gonna say father I asked for and receive supernatural discernment and sound wisdom that I will bind to my soul in Jesus name I receive it amen amen you can sit down one of the examples I'm gonna kill people keep saying I am so tired don't save tired but they know I keep talking about the knot Flat Earth theory okay but seriously there's a whole group of dedicated committed believers that think they have absolute proof without question that the world this earth is flat because if the enemy can't get you sucked into pure deception like freely sin it's okay Jesus doesn't care or say it's gonna be forgiven and he'll be back up in heaven one day and and that's what some people preach that I I know I know people who were in those churches on purpose for two years to see how far they would go and so people will start just talking about the love love above above God love so much this is okay then you know he loves you and read all the scriptures that talk about love and only love with no accountability they've even made ho Bibles to only left lots of stuff out so there's no accountability now that is deception there's a little bit difference confusion misunderstanding of the spirit realm or no understanding of the spirit realm and spiritual places is really what the whole Flat Earth is based on they don't know but the spirit realm is they don't or they wouldn't be saying that because one of the scriptures they used to prove the earth is flat is the Bible talks about the four corners of the earth north south east and west but they don't think that means that they are literally saying that the earth has corners and another one they use is it talks about the pillars of the earth the earth is set on the pillars of the earth that also is a spiritual thing that's not talking about a physical thing there are two angels over 2,000 miles high that God stood with the earth like pillars until we needed them in the very last days but they're picturing pillars holding up this Flat Earth so it holds it in place and I guess it doesn't fall over or float somebody I don't know about that one and there's a couple more than use but but they're taking them not only out of contacts there's spiritual things that they're trying to say are physical things because lack of knowledge of the spiritual realm so how many people know the earth is not flat see amen please amen I get emails all the time I go no it is not it says God sits upon the circle of the earth so if it's a circle it can't have corners it is a good point it's the word then they don't know what to say well that doesn't look didn't it that doesn't literally mean it's round why don't you go back to geometry class or maybe kindergarden I'm not making fun of them I'm being really serious because if they're there if they are fiercely forcing this upon people to believe this then they should take seriously go back and see what a circle is everybody say it's round so that wipes out one whole Scripture they use and why don't you realize north-south-east-west that goes like this okay nor I'm known doing wrong north-south-east-west something like that those are the four corners of the earth it's actually a direction it's not even something you can see so if the earth was flat you would see had corners and so none of that works out even in your natural mind so I don't know where their mind is but God help them all remove the blinders so you don't waste their time right now if he can't get you into deception he will absolutely get you into diversions and what happens is you're going forward and all of a sudden you get sidetracked you're not on his path anymore that means you're not going forward in the kingdom you're over here like this by the way that's a circle I got to stop doing that people go you're being mean to the Flat Earth people know I'm trying to bring some sense into them or understanding that you're not pursuing the right thing or you'd have the right answers there are spiritual places in the earth all over in the earth and they don't see that they only see this if a God says they see right here it's what they see that's how far they can see if all your head is just man's head knowledge if you don't have sound wisdom or understanding which is knowledge of the Holy One if you're not pursuing the spirit if you don't have Holy Spirit invading you all the time becoming your best friend getting in your face sharing truth in the scriptures showing you things to come revealing the hidden things of God not to flatter I just can't even imagine I tell you what happens not but you know how many people think heaven is a flat place in the sky he's and yet he framed the worlds he framed the worlds okay and they think when it talks about his house it's a building you couldn't contain God in a building first time he visited the earth you set the mountains on fire by walking past them you could hear him walking from miles of and the terror of God fell upon them because they realized he's much bigger and greater than we thought he was he is our Papa he's not well he is our spiritual Papa but literally we came from him first we were in him we lived in him he's passionate he's consumed with passion and love for you so much that it is turned to fire flames of fire with passion that burns for you over the stones of fire that pushes the rainbow out of him if you put a light under gemstones it shoots out a rainbow so the father sits on the throne filled with these massive gorgeously just almost unspeakable with Beauty gemstones that have blue fire flames burning up around him inside of him and it pushes that rainbow outside and it moves in and out of him in waves like that and his eyes are blue flames of fire that your father who spoke everything into being every single thing he wills that with his will how important is your will your reals a spiritual thing you can't reach in and touch your will you can't cut it out and show it to somebody you can't cut your soul out and show it to somebody your soul has a mind it has the will and it has emotions which are all of your actions and your feelings that you display every day of your life those are still spiritual things so you do have a lot of spiritual activity you know that or to think that but it's displayed in the natural realm and seen in the natural realm but that comes from your soul as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that heart that word heart means the core it doesn't mean your human heart beating is that's a physical thing and your soul is not a physical thing it's a spiritual thing it can't ever be separated from your spiritual body you can't separate them okay so your spirit man's affected by what your soul gets fed your soul will affect every part of your being it's at the very core of your being in here very core is your soul and what you let in the eyes are the window to the so what you watch goes into your what goes into your soul you will think about you will keep thinking until you choose it with your will when you choose it with you will you will then act it out so how important is to guard your heart the very core of your being guard it protect your soul protect it from things you see you hear you say you feed your soul all day long that spiritual thing you're feeding it so that means spiritual beings are drawn to what you are displaying from your soul so if you feed your soul darkness what are you going to attract yourself if you feed it full of joy celebration excitement creativity and life and hope and joy what is going to be attracted to it God's angels and God himself so that's why this time is so important why does he give revelation about the soul which is a spiritual thing manifests its sons and daughters of God you have to walk free of the enemy because God's not going to allow you or give you power to do greater works or to shake the earth itself speak to the ground have crops come up purify the air by speaking with his frequency from your voice stopping earthquakes and making them put it back the way it was before he's not gonna let people do that if they're filled with darkness can you see that because you can't take power over the darkness if you are filled with it because if it's in your heart you'll think about it that means yes what you won't your God it will really see her it even talks about it being seared it gets syrupy because you get too much of the darkness in you say Amen this is like this is why it's called boot camp okay I know when my husband see boot camp he didn't know he could do all the stuff he could do so he came out he learned different things he could do how far he can make himself go I'm strong could be the weapons he got and how we could use them he is still a marine trust me and that man looks so good so spirit or spirit realm boot camp God had me started he said you will be taken everywhere this is the second place I have taken it Joan hunter on taxes heard about heavy come at you there they had so many people come in they didn't know what to do with them and I do know that I'm trying to think in the natural now Chuck Pierce sent a whole group of his women down to see what it was all about he couldn't go so he sent a whole coalition down I think like there was a bunch of them to attend and tomorrow when you come I have a handout to give you which I almost never do when you see things that are spiritual in the physical realm you'll see portals opening you'll see things coming out of portals you'll see what some of that spiritual highway looks like and I didn't take them in heaven I took him on the earth but the spirit realm was opened you know God can reveal what he wants to reveal amen he's revealing himself more like he never has before because we're like him we're supposed to be like him right so I never had this understanding about the soul but it made me I understood why things happened after I had the understanding what it was and people trying to tell me oh no the soul is just the mind it's just a mind why do you tell people that other stuff that's just gonna confuse them a point no the so is a spiritual thing and has layers just like your body has layers and your spirit man has layers because God has layers in himself Christ has layers and even Holy Spirit as unlimited layers he takes a layer of himself and sends it somewhere it's a hole of him and that's how he knows everything all at the same time everywhere he sends a layer of himself it's him it's not a copycat it's not just a little shadow it's him that's how he is he sends them wherever he wants to when you invite you into and well you he sends a layer of himself a hole of himself to abide in you that's why you're the temple a shadow wouldn't need a temple but this is a hole be God called Holy Spirit moving into you and you have a hole of him he knows everything about you all the time everywhere you go but he knows everything on the earth no matter where it is what it is what's going on he knows every single bit of it because he has coated this artist with his layers he just grabs one and sends it like that your soul has layers your emotions are the layers the more you have the more expressed expressive the more creative you are and some ethnic groups are more expressive because they have more layers in their soul and between those layers you collect stuff that's where it gets collected remember the eyes are winter to the soul thing that's why you can remember it where does your memory come from it's your mind and you express what you every time you remember something that's not good you're gonna get sad or oppressed or upset and then me want you to think about it over and over and over and over and over - especially if you were offended or somebody says that mugging you he will replay that board all day all night oh you go to sleep at wickham oh you're still hearing it loose it from your soul the word says cast all your care upon Jesus because he cares for you it's just a good way to cast it because you're loosing it out of you and Jesus is also the restorer of your soul you know you don't know how many even I'm saying how many times he talks about the soul it's that important what does that mean what you loose on earth out of your soul he will come down and pull it out because he's a restored your soul if he pulls it out you have no memory of it not addictions not pornography not abuse he is showing us such depth of understanding of how he put us together the spiritual parts he's really highlighting the spiritual parts you know why so the physical parts can be whole because even as your soul prospers you your whole being will prosper and live and that is one of the few promises that promises you divine health is tied to your soul your heart the core of your being that's why we have to have accountability say Amen even in heaven the Angels head accountability and when they didn't line up guess what they went not to a good place the woodshed for sure and it hurt robot so he is he's showing you he's actually dividing asunder it says in the word that - it just sort of divides us under what it's the spirit from the flesh okay so you can live in the flesh and be in the flesh which to be fleshly mind it is who wants to be death if all you think about in your natural head that means your natural head with your own rights your opinions and you're gonna do it your way no matter when you don't care what anybody says it's that you get hurt or they just don't care that your flesh your selfish flesh okay you can't even see your flesh cuz I'm not talking about this flesh I'm talking about in your soul as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so to be spiritually minded is say life that's why you need to know about the spiritual things this is like grade-school understanding the body should have had a long time ago your soul has to be engaged it has been engaged to be powerful through Christ because you let him have his will his way you're surrendering your well to have his ways so if you surrender oil that means you don't have the right to tell it what you do that means your flesh that's in there doesn't have the right to be in control you can surrender you can surrender your life to Christ you could be born again you know you're going to heaven but you can have so much flesh on you it's ridiculous all you think about is you what you want what you want to say you know this is the only thing that's right no it's always been this way we're gonna do this way it doesn't matter what we think God is saying or what you're what you're discussing or anything we think this is it so we're going this way that's not surrender people go I have rights and want didn't you lay them down when you died with Christ because guess what if you're a dead man you don't have any rights if you're a dead man Christ Christ can use you really well but Satan can't use you at all if you're dead you can't get offended if you're dead to the flesh and your selfish flesh if you're dead to those ways those thoughts Satan can't use you he can't win you offend you he can't distract you deceive you that's why it's important to die to your flesh okay not this no greater loveth this than a man lay down his life for another is not talking about taking a bullet it's about you surrendering your rights your opinions instead of pushing yourself on them and telling them they're going to hell God hates them because you think this is the right thing to say no surrender your own words and your thoughts let Christ put his in you and bring them life and then they want him [Applause] this is church this is training you to do the work of the amazing powerful supernatural new creation ministry taking the gospel of the kingdom carrying the glory around this world amen so I think I'm done with session 1 so tomorrow when you come I will have these manuals what do you want to call them programs the Holy Spirit keeps calling a program because heavens having a show right now every show has a program say Amen because that's what we're doing and there'll be some really legalistic people that don't like that because their flesh is still in control if their spirit man was engaged they would think this was very exciting most exciting news I've ever heard we get to put on a show and manifest for God till we shock this world in stunned hell that's the show he wants us to do amen so before I go I'm gonna declare some of you but I'm gonna he told me to share one more thing the first show that was put on was in heaven and the father did that himself he did not need any help from any angel no Archangel not even the word not even Holy Spirit he didn't need their help to kick every single one of those out of heaven because one of his weapons is lightning the lightning power of God destroys and unseats the works of darkness it talks about in the word thunders and lightnings coming from the throne that's coming from him you see these blue lightning bolts shooting across the throne room and people run to get hit by them it's a million megawatts of love and the thunderings many times are actually his own voice because in the word says his voice sounds like many waters or many thunders because his voice has layers when he made the angels see he didn't birth them he didn't send them from himself he just made them he spoke and made them he's he spoke and the word made them the proper way to say is the father spoke he spoke a word and the word made it that's why his name was the word all spirit no flesh until the day he decided to come down here and die for us and he had flesh put on him the second show was by his son when he show him you know it says that God showed his son his reward before he came here he showed him his reward it was more than one okay if you get rewarded for sometimes this more than one thing one of them is when someone comes home to heaven he walks him personally up the steps that throne gives him back to the Father that's one reward I know Heath they told me that some a long time ago that he got to do that so I know no matter which family members living up there now they met Jesus Christ at the gates and you scored him up the steps they had a celebration in the throne room the greatest celebration ever the Father which is out of the glory and held them to himself and this is what they know I came from here and when you meet the one who sent you from himself that carried you for eons of time loved you carried you nurtured you spoke to you saying over you wrote books about you made plans for you he he's your father was willing to send His only Son what a sacrifice that's love that's love and had that flesh put on him and then the greatest there were two things that really that he told me he suffered the most about one was the cup he had to drink a sinless perfect being to drink all the sins of the world in the garden of the cemani that was one of the hardest things yet the other thing was being separated from his father did not hear him for those three days was in hell Abraham's bosom first thing he crossed over to hell by himself that was something they'd never done before because God was about to put the second show on and Christ stood up on the third day according to Colossians and spoiled and ruined and crushed principalities and powers so badly they cannot change their image back after he was done with them that was a second show the third show is gonna be done during the kingdom age by the greater works the signs and wonders the generation that will be on this earth that will live and and experience the powers of the age to come which is the Millennial age it will walk in those same powers it lived to be hundreds of years old like the people who live on the earth one crisis on the throne those people it'll be time for us the vital Christ to put on the third show and torment the demonic blind them with the light of glory that comes from us unseat them crushed what they were doing you know take away all the power overs that they thought they had push back darkness right in the face of the enemy until it torments them and to the light of the glory is seen and known all over this world that is a show so in this time he wants you to stand up and stand out amen okay he made you to be you no man really made you he made you you were always with him until he made this time-space planet and we'll talk about time in spiritual time tomorrow night and then you'll see spiritual activity I have some things in my flash drive but you're actually going to have your own thing you can take with you that'll just get you absolutely undone so this is a great time to be alive you need to get up in the morning say god I expect to do great things for you I expect to see great things done in this earth I expect to know you more to see you to see you everybody say I want a face-to-face encounter with the Living God I'm asking and now I'm thanking you for it amen father give it to them amen thank you for listening yes thank you for coming Kath [Applause] well

we ask that you would be glorified and Lord as we honor cat in Jesus name Amen let's give her a hand as she comes oh very good very good thank you lord thanks um thank you I just got zapped by you that's upside down that won't help me welcome everybody can you hear me okay is this okay I get it a little bit closer is that better okay and I have a gift look at this little mousey he is my laser because before I could you could not really see you I don't know if you can see that you may or may not see it but whatever uh well the good news is everyone should have your your manual who doesn't have one is running he does not have one of these and I don't know if you have anymore but there's a couple people raising their hands raise your hand if you don't have one just like this cuz you probably already looked at it but we're gonna go through it together and I've only done this one other time but the people didn't have it like until like right at the very very end of anything I've never done anything like this before but God's always make me do new things he would not let me create a syllabus and he said do not ever call what you do a conference he said we need encounters in this time so our conferences everyone out there all you pastors leaders start calling it an encounter name it what you want to but call it an encounter we need encounters with a living God we don't need another conference to get head knowledge we need our God to invade us amen he actually called this a program he said you're not gonna do a syllabus which is like this thick we read it go through it scripture by scripture then put it in a closet somewhere I used to do that and so this is actually got pictures because God is all about images manifesting and demonstrating for God is showing his image and his power so in this time on the earth one of the main Commission's I have besides revealing heaven is to reveal the spirit realm so we know what he means when he talks about the spirit and the flesh in the Bible many scriptures talked about that those are usually things concerning your soul the way you react respond or what you're saying of what you're doing is either in the flesh or in the spirit and we all know what the word says to be spiritually minded is life to be fleshly minded is death that means you're not producing anything that anybody needs uses or wants and so more and more he wants us to walk in the spirit learn the ways of the Spirit operate with the Holy Spirit be more spiritually minded than flesh means your human mind your human reactions your human understanding he wants you more and more to understand in the spirit then you can walk in the spirit because then you have life in you and coming from you and so one of the most things lacking in the body of Christ is an understanding of what is the spirit realm because that's where you came from that's what we operate in all your authority your declarations your decrees even your prayers you've been praying aren't about this physical realm you're releasing them into the spiritual realm they go up to heaven which is a spiritual world and they were responded by spiritual beings by the host by Gabriel's angels whatever the respondent in the spiritual manner that impact the physical realm so most people understand while I'm praying this is a spiritual thing I'm doing but most all their other activities they don't think of it as being important to understand the ways of the Spirit and what the spirit run around me so if you were here last night you really if you weren't here last night you really seriously need to get that that tape you need to get it because I talked about how we operate the spirit where in the Bible is talking about things that represents just scriptures they're talking about the spirit realm or spiritual places and spiritual activities that people think that's talking about the physical realm and so there's scriptures in the Bible connected to the spirit and when it's collected to this physical connected to this physical realm and we have to understand if we're going to rightly divide the word then you need to know which ones he's talking about because it changes your life and so that was the first night and I've never actually done that ever before in a meeting I usually would strictly talk about the spirit realm and start talking about what it looked like what went on there some of the beings that were there how we will this world is becoming more and more spiritually minded I'm talking about even the secular world when I say secular I'm talking about the ones that are not believers I know we could call them the lost the unsaved the wicked the the nicest term you can use a secular okay there's the there's the believers about it Christ then all the rest the world is the secular world not connected to God not knowing God and they need to know him everyone came from him that ever came and existed on this earth they all came from him and that's why he said he wants the vilest sinner set free there's only one unpardonable sin that means it can never be pardoned so even the vilest sins you see happening in this world today no matter how horrible they are they can be forgiven if people sincerely ask to be forgiven and repent for them the one thing that can never be forgiven is if you had a relationship with God like Lucifer did Lucifer was not Satan he became Satan he chose to birth iniquity from himself it was found in him certainly wasn't anywhere in heaven nor in God knowing the word nor in Holy Spirit it was birth and and I've talked a whole lot my 80th 81st meeting I think and this climate is very dry I'm I'm from Florida we get a free spa treatment women every time you step outside and you have 100percent humidity so we don't wrinkle easily okay our skin is always soft unless we go up north and then it feels like sand so there is benefits to being in 100 humidity atmosphere people pay a lot of money for that okay we get it for free just living there so I go back home and get my spa treatment but more and more God wants you to know who he is as your true father why he calls you his sons and daughters why he welcomes you home not as someone's husband or wife or mother but he welcomes you home as his sons and daughters because he bursts him births all of us from himself we lived in him I talked a lot about that last night and when I was just in Canada I was in Saskatchewan Canada or it ended up by being seven meetings instead of like four and this place had never heard of me before they sat there stunned and undone and there was one person I'm telling you descent one person in the last meeting I had planned to speak about something that was heaven culture and he said there's one person here I've got to change their mindset about me so you're gonna do something different you never done and I went I showed the whole big picture started with heaven was just heaven and when God began to create things in heaven he created the Angels how we did that all the way to us living in him the whole time he was doing this he's been from the beginning to the end the end at the beginning and the whole time we were in him before he made the earth we lived in him and so we were we were used to going places with him we we could see and understand who he was and then that was taken away from us when he sent us himself he actually made a time space planet so that he could send us to have a body you had a little spiritual body of light you were made out of light and that's in them and by the way the food in heaven is all made out of light you eat all you want to there's no weight gain no food allergies I'm just gonna put that there for free people celebrate they worship they eat they fellowship they worship they eat they eat they fellowship they worship they go on tours of heaven they do all kind of wild fun things and they eat everywhere they go Jesus has a sweet tooth if you got one blame it on him so there's just a few things about about heaven but right now I'm gonna be talking about heaven on this earth and how we are actually being connected to it it is invading at an accelerated rate that means the ways of heaven the things that are in heaven even things they wear certain things they say you're gonna hear new words released I release them all the time about the way they talk in heaven and places they visit those things are being created on the earth and that's not a mistake that's a that's happening now because if heaven this is if it's gonna be on earth as it is in heaven that means we're going to have things similar to what's in heaven created on the earth new inventions and ideas are coming that will actually change your entire life the way we live even the cost of us living is going to change because of these new inventions and then we will be doing some things on earth just like they do in heaven like painting with light painting with light like houses cars a hair will be done with light color not like chemicals and you know put enough foils in your here you could contact Mars every woman knows what I'm talking about if you've ever had your hair done it's going to make it simpler because in heaven they live this amazing life filled with Wonder splendor and the greatest technology ever is in heaven and especially with Holograms they do a lot of things with Holograms only it's not just light it's actual beings and you go to actual places in Holograms with Holograms it's really a way of life it's heaven culture so one of the greatest technologies you see on the earth will be done in computers and other systems and ways and things that we get to enjoy and do will be done through Holograms and you'll see more and more of those invented and put out there it's gonna be amazing why do I want to escape during the greatest times on the earth and that means if this is going to happen things have to improve in almost every arena of our life like wickedness and darkness we push back in regions where they do that on purpose but in many regions of light and glory and safety that will be created on the earth that we will live in and so a whole different change we've already been shifted onto God's timeline and he has his own time he goes by not man's say amen most of you won't even be here during the perilous times or the tribulation that is an extremely short period of time and God still has to have us carry the glory first of all learn how to carry yet what it is how it operates and then the knowledge of it being carried around this world many times over shaking the world and stunning hell that hasn't happened the fire has not happened the baptism and Fire has not happened in mass and it will happen it will come in waves from heaven and the angelic are a part of that baptism and fire I'll show you in the word it says his angels make his ministers flames of just like in the upper room so that hasn't happened in case you're wondering the wealth of the wicked and I was actually gonna have us all stand up and open the vault you're already concerned you already consumed in the atmosphere of heaven in this room and so many prophetic things and words and visions and things will come to you just sitting there just tell open your hand say God I want it I literally was gonna have us date up and open the vaults that have been holding back this is the time for this great well to begin to because people are running after God's time and they realized beginning to realize who they are we shouldn't be held back for any reason because in heaven because there's no sin there's no sin in heaven there's no evil in heaven so when it's not a part of you when Christ's children said there's none of him in me he meant the enemy he meant the devil and he lived as a man in this world with the devil not in him had more fun wreaked havoc to the religious hierarchy of his day and broke all the kind of laws and traditions to show them this is the now time of God right then it was a now time for Christ to be walking on the earth than when he made everything demonstrated manifests the power of God that he actually was over time now under time over the weather not under the weather that he could accelerate propel in time he could hold time still he did all these things walking as a righteous man that's why they causing the son of man he had to be just like us although inside he was still God he couldn't use his God powers he had to actually accumulate and walk in righteousness pursue every level God revealed to him on the earth he had to choose with his will every day of his life to say yes to what the father was asking him to do that's why he that's why he got to the point where it didn't matter where he walked life came and he spoke life wherever he went and that he didn't mind judging the leadership of that day that was lying to the people burdening the people stealing from the people and they didn't like him because he was a great threat to the way they lived their life which was going to change so this is the time of change again change has come to the earth again you're not waiting on it because you're hearing these words live in heaven culture that's on earth as it is in heaven take power over the enemy engage with the hosts of heaven heaven is a weapon bash the enemy you always wanted to hit him anyway right with the only way you're physically literally going to do that is to sip the host of heaven on every demonic being that's anywhere around you and they will crush them bash them literally I I have seen acts of war between the army of light and army of darkness and army of darkness always loses they actually lose parts of their being you can't kill them but they get marred and scarred because there's no life in the darkness they can't get healed and yes the army of heaven sometimes they get kind of beat up they get worn and all their warring but there's always healing refreshing for them they get to go back to heaven and play take a break and then be sent back here to war on your behalf and they're out there for you all the time and when you when you pray or when you command this is the time to come and people go I don't like that did Christ command you better say yes did he command the hosts of heaven did he heal the sick did he not tolerate one demon around him was he ever attacked by demons did he multiply the food so that many was never hungry he wasn't poor he had a treasure to carry his money he paid for the upkeep in the food of all the men that were with him sometimes bought food for everyone who came to hear him which was thousands of people he had homes he had wealthy friends he even had sinners that liked him because he did really good ethical excellent contracts for carpentry you ever wonder what he set with sinners they were business connections he took the gospel through the business world of that day and so did Paul Paul made fabrics work with fabrics made tents made banners he was a businessman even Peter was a fisherman he was a businessman Luke was a physician he was a businessman if you just go on down the line God use business people they already have ethics they understand protocol they understand you know honoring those in authority it was much easier for him to use business people than just people religious that's why you're hearing things about the marketplace the marketplace ministry that's what Jesus did he had a marketplace ministry when he was on the earth a master carpenter who was sought out because of his gift and he was remembered and so was Joseph so get ready to be in business it's going to begin to happen God's gonna give you witty ideas and inventions or connect you to people that you have a part of that business that they need he's gonna bring people together for that and he's even gonna connect and I said this when I was here the last time he's gonna bring Orthodox Jewish businessmen and partner them with believers in business and that is already happening it's already happening you're this is this world is changing and people who want to hide because I think it's the end aren't even gonna be a part of it and guess who he's calling to be a part of it us those who follow him you know it's nice to be a fan of something but why not follow follow means you're running after what he's got and you want to act just like him and people didn't like it when I started saying take authority over the weather teaching them how to deal with the hurricanes and tsunamis the fires and let me tell you what rains went and put out a lot of those fighters when we told it to and that one hurricane got beat up so bad it didn't know what it was doing and I'm from Florida and no matter what they showed you on the news it was not that bad because their own words were saying how horrific is that it would be it would be debt it would be like death to people if you stayed you would die that people were leaving like by the millions I didn't go anywhere because I'm over the weather not under the weather and we even changed the course of that hurricane because it was drought on the on the west side of Florida there was a lot of drought the farmers if there things would have never gone to market if they didn't get the rain they needed on their orchards and their other products of produce they were making and so we actually told it not to go off to the right we sent over to the left of Florida and mainly up the center to the west - and it soaked all of that and they were saying Tampa will be wiped out the city be wiped out and never even touched Tampa and yet the Weather Channel was there trying to say try to show devastation and people saw them mocking it some of the things they show them from past hurricanes I'm just letting you know then they tried to show Jackson was one the worst hit I'm telling you I live there we had some tree limbs come down the three areas that flooded always flood downtown there's an overpass if you drive through a rainstorm you want your cars going to be under water so it always floods see and Marco I worked there you'd walk through water up to your knees just from a rain storm so they had flooding in those areas on Black Creek if you if you want to live there you should have your house on stilts about 10 feet high because that Creek always overflows its banks and the waters receded and people did I'm not saying that wasn't some damage but there was not death and destruction like they forecast and some of those videos that were showing what from past events someone who lives in Kissimmee they saw them mocking what showing people how horrible it was and it wasn't they lived there and they actually I think it was Roy fields was telling people it wasn't as bad as they said some of the lights went out but hey we're used to that when thunderstorm comes and my and my house was not even touched we had a few pine calls hit pine pine cones hit the roof that was it and mainly what happens is when arranged well hard the trees get heavy so they fall on a power line and then it puts everybody's lights out they go remove the tree hook it back up and his fix so it was not anything like they had said it was going to be because the body of Christ for the first time came together as weather warriors and they were we are over the weather because Christ stopped the storm and when he woke up he look at the disciples like what's wrong with you he'd actually taught them that what is wrong with you why did you wake me up he expected them to stop it so this is something we're supposed to walk in it is our right as a believer we are over the weather we are over the earth we are over not under amen and so he's actually starting a move called the weather warriors and there'll be people who are Watchmen that will spot everything going on they will alert all the weather warriors that begin to bash it take authority over it and you're gonna see the weather begin to change around the world because that Devils been driving it and powering it and riding in it to bring death and destruction if we're over all the power of the enemy that doesn't mean leave the storms out or the fires or the droughts you're right and we really haven't just living our life letting it go on we're just giving all that authority than anything mean to run over some beat us up kill steal and destroy and yet Jesus came to bring life and bring it more so start living abundant life so I'm glad he opened the bolts and that seriously happened because that was something God said you was gonna happen tonight so I thought I would be doing that but nope it was pastor so everybody's hold your hands up and say I receive the world bring it on we are over it not controlled by it amen make sure you receive that word amen so so I'm gonna share a show a few things we'll actually share a few things I almost never talk about products I forget I have them and yet when I go and share I'm sharing from these things I already have produced and put out there this is one of my newest ones it's called culture of honor that's how we're supposed to honor each other on the earth how we honor people from the past and then it takes you to heaven how how they honor people in heaven by the way they live their life on the earth how even the hierarchy of heaven the Father Son and Holy Spirit is honored by the angelic and how they honor each other this is heaven culture the honor of culture is one of the main things that you will see when you go to heaven or your chapter you're caught up there amen and so that's it this other one I talked about look at last night born again this is not just telling you receive Christ you get born again you're a new creation get a Bible start reading it and go to church although I I'm saying all those aren't important to be connected to those who believe in operate in the now time of God not that the others aren't important but in that time when God used that he is now using the body of Christ corporately to actually get out there and do the work of the ministry by demonstrating how to live heaven culture on this earth it's not a hard assignment trust me and so this is called born again from the moment you say yes to Christ what happened in the spirit realm what happened inside your entire spiritual being what happened in heaven what happened in eternity what happened in hell this is going to tell you exactly what happened what what you get depart deposited into you by the by the son by the father by the Holy Spirit what happens in the Lamb's Book of Life what does that look like what is your future then look like what not to fall back into you how to order your life now that you are a believer and a follow of Jesus Christ the traps of the enemy operations of the spirit realm I'm telling you this is it right here for people they say give it to them the other student they're not ever gonna fall back into the enemies on they'll never lose their seat that's been established for them I'm not saying that they may not go to heaven I'm just saying they won't be powerful they won't be successful they need to have an understanding from the moment they're safe what happened and this talks to them about the spirit operating in the spirit how their spiritual being how they are a living soul what to do with their soul how to loose things from their soul if they're getting if they encounter things after the born-again it's very it's a little tiny single CD it is a powerful witnessing tool and we actually was recorded this at this church with his pastor lay down his life got got kicked up by the Baptist he's got the Holy Spirit and it's called new new freedom its new freedom fellowship in a little Oklahoma Missouri that has one blinking traffic light and the sign says the little town where big things happen and so we actually recorded and dedicated to his memory he has now in heaven reaping all his rewards but it's powerful is God said I'm gonna finally reveal what happens when you're born again you know what the new creation revealing of the Kings this is the spiritual Kings that he is king over he is a king of spiritual kings those are levels of authority and Dominion that we can go after in this time those are eternal positions not temporal the Bible says we are kings and priests unto our Lord those are spiritual positions for a spiritual Lord who is a spiritual Kingdom is powerful male or female Kings [Music] male or females there are no Queens and people go what about that if the guys the guys if you can be part of the Bride of Christ do you it really what realized as a spiritual position I hope you say yes so in the spirits you can be a Bride of Christ with your male or female say Amen so in the spirit realm you can be a king with your male or female it's levels of authority and Dominion you are taking yourself that take you to those very high levels of authority priests lords and kings are eternal positions and this is a really powerful CD and it talks about and it gives you scriptures of course everything gives you scriptures and then this one is really funny this is called superheroes there I am in a superhero costume yes I've worn one and spoken it before I don't wear the spandex okay you won't be seeing that but I have what I call superhero blue I do have an outfit I wear it and the Holy Spirit makes me wear it especially I do it in healing rooms for some reason that's Ryan de Bie wearing it Santa Maria healing room I think this is where this was taped and it's a double one because they just let me go they didn't care how long I went and I did not know that the pastor who's a great character behind me was showing scenes of The Avengers Superman Batman all of those other superheroes and I actually talked about and this is very fascinating it talks about why the world is wild over them why do they seek after somebody who can help rescue be a role model for people that they bring hope and a future to people's lives why do they run after that how Christ is our own superhero but how we now become heaven superheroes it's very focused it's very good and the first time I ever went back and we and recorded parts of it you couldn't hear clearly we spent a lot of time making this so this is real powerful you are having superheroes and they're all cheering us on amen so that's that's the end of those there you go yes you may give it to him so that was my little commercial amen I've told people it is one of the best witnessing tools you can give anybody give it to him they will want to belong to Jesus Christ it shows him in all his power all his glory the sacrifice he made by changing his image from the word to the Son of God what he literally gave up to do that we know what he did on the earth but you don't know what he gave up in heaven that he had flush put on him for the first time I will always have that flesh through all of eternity because it was to become acquainted with us and and he would be acquainted with our sufferings and our trials and it changed him even when he did that and made him love us more even living amongst us when they were rejecting him he forgave us for that but it really showed who he was as the word where it talks about him being in the word how we work together with the father step in the father he would go somewhere the father would speak what he wanted and the word stepped out and made it and then it takes you to the Scriptures world jesus said you and me and me and you I mean there's so much evidence of the word of Christ what he gave up for us and what he meant when he was saying those things when he was on the earth of course that's talking about something spiritual again when you go home to heaven you step in the Father Holy Spirit steps in Jesus steps in and we are all one together and anyway so but we're gonna talk about spirit realm boot camp right now and at the end if at all possible on living hands on every person in here [Music] and I'm gonna lay hands on you and impart unto you revelation for operating in the spirit realm I've never done it before I've released the life of God I've read I have released the life of God I've released a lightning power of God I've released all kinds of things into people but never this so this is new this is new and this is gonna become like a movement spirit around boot camp and people actually be able to come get trained and go get these managers and go do it yourself okay I can't go everywhere and so at one time I'll actually will have a an event where we what we do training like training with everybody specifically to train you how to share this and you already know it's gonna include living heaven culturing men and how many people have never heard me before can I see your hands a few people Wow well this is a new time on earth and I am living heaven culture right now you're seeing heaven culture on my head heaven is one of the most beautiful places God gave me a commission I didn't ask for the Commission I personally pursued I got born again at 4 out of 65 and I'm getting younger because Christ is the restorer of our youth so if all you're talking about is becoming old you will be you actually have me tell people and your words are powerful your words got you where you are right now where you are right now in your life your words did that even though people may have been involved people came against you they did things to you maybe not even maybe even horrible things but your words what you're saying right now about yourself what you think about yourself what people are saying about you you don't have to accept any of that you accept what God has said about you you're wonderfully and perfectly made you came from him he is your father he made everything that was ever made he has great plans for you he doesn't have bad plans for you he sings over you he wants you to have deep beautif sleep sweet sleep he'll give you sweet dreams if you ask for them whatever you ask for from him he will give it to you so get up and ask for sound wisdom supernatural discernment excitement expectation celebration you know God carries that it's in him all the time or he couldn't create if you were sad even just sadness will stop you from being who God wants you to be if you walk around sad and you don't know why don't keep it in there something happened you 50 years ago stopped letting it make you sad loose it out of your soul because whatever is in there you're gonna think about an enemy we'll make sure he replays every bad thing you did those images are in you you loose them out of your soul it's like they were never there and the next time I go back and speak in a men's prison I'm gonna teach every one of them how to do that I they will loose every crime they ever committed the crime won't be in them when they get out they will never go back to crime prison is a good example of a soul that's all messed up and they don't know what to do with it they don't even realizing that are helping to keep themself in that in that situation in position if you've been in poverty a long time it's probably because you've been saying all along we don't have anything we never will we can't do that we can't buy that we can't have that guess what you're doing you're stealing those works you are you shall eat the fruit of your lips as a man thinketh inside himself so is he and the more you say that you begin to believe it and the more you believe it you live it so let's change the way we've been living our life and start saying things that God says about us I before I knew any of this stuff I get up in the morning I'm gonna start saying what God said about me and every time I said it I said I would feel more powerful in him and he would open up his self and reveal more of him to me because I was actually saying I believed he existed we don't have any problem talking about things all around us going on you see but you know what it's not seeing as believing believing is seeing what you begin to believe you will see in your spirit man and said that's not even in the Bible calling those things that be not as though they were yes it is if you want change start saying what you want changed and then say and I'm willing to be obedient to change anything you want me to change and then he'll begin to give you a list I lived every single bit of this I'm sharing with you I lived every bit of it I I had to go through this I had to actually see that this was truth it was in the word I just believed what it said and one day the more this is if you don't even trust God if you don't trust people because the things that happen to you loose all the junk all the abuse all the negative words hateful defiling words all the profane things that you've heard or said or seen loose it and get out of your soul buying the love of God if you just start without yourself to bind the love of God and the presence of God to your soul and then just start saying God I don't want to live this way anymore I want my family to prosper I want my soul to prosper I'm gonna be just like you you can't remember anything just get before God say I want to be just like you guess what that's what he wants you're actually agreeing with him he sent you here to represent him and to be like him it's in the word let us make man in our image and after our likeness but we walked through this world like well this is my lot no he didn't give you that lot man may have the enemy certainly was a part of that but that's not what God had plan for you those things he wrote in that book about you for he sent you was all the great things he had for you these are my purposes my plans this is what I've sent you to do this is what I've called you to you and yet we listen to a man says all the time or the arts and entertainment media which pretty much 75percent of everything they put up there's bad say man you feel yourself with that you're gonna think about it any man you can have a good time enjoy your life and have fun you just need to be aware of what is not good for you and what it would is very good for you amen and I speak to the Hollywood the movie industry all the time I've already put them on notice they don't stop putting the darkness out there they're gonna bomb and they're gonna lose all their money I've even talked to him about them the habitation of God coming to the earth I don't care what they think they need to know truth too because when they see it happening guess what they're gonna know my gosh is what she's talking about it really is happening people aren't coming to these movies we better tweet them they make a perfectly good movie then they put like 12 profane horrible words in there they have to put one or two scenes that aren't good at all to make them get either pg-13 or R rating even though they can clearly look at the history of Hollywood and see the five top grossing movies of all time RG and PG movies so why don't they want to make them because if they make them that means you can bring your family that means more people but they're because their minds are seared and they live in darkness what they produce is darkness they almost can't help what they're putting out of them because if it's in you that's what you will express how much what you will write and that's what you will you know give out to everyone to see so they need to get saved or at least be aware even though you may think the world lives like this they don't all live like that even the part that's not Christians there's still a good moral majority in this nation that doesn't want all that junk and they've already already five of their top movies they put out have bombed and they've lost millions but the other ones that are just simple people can't stop going to them because they can take their families their friends and if you want to take it up a notch then you can go look at that stuff I don't take you up a notch it takes you down unless you're following Satan then I know where you will end up and you won't like those that you won't like what you get there they're not just no breakfast in hell there's no life in hell there's a song that says that there's a song does anybody remember who wrote this song and my the Newsboys in the father's house or something like that it's called yeah and he actually they say that there's no breakfast in hell and what man they got that right do you know the noise boys I was a Christian group and they were ahead of their time but their songs it was awesome so yes I could go into a lot of different things right now but I want to go ahead and and talk about the spirit realm boot camp and and so if you got you if you got your little thing just hold it up and let's look at it and I will tell you this your natural mind may not understand much of this but your spirit man will really pull it in your spirit man will be so excited that your spirit man is being fed and today they're getting a cafeteria including dessert getting the whole meal including dessert the creature on the front of this is not a cloud this is a spiritual being I didn't cover that part but spiritual beings some of them appear transparent some of them are filled with light and glory this one certainly is filled with light and glory and if you look it's a profile at standing like this and it's got its hand like this can you see that right under its chin it's hand is literally like this and it has one big eye do you see yet in that eye there's only half of a lens because the other part records you can actually see your face in the eye if my mine I can but there's actually a face and this is this this fear this this angels name I actually set a host the hosts are made well the angels are made in drops okay their maintenance ribes the first tribes weren't the American you know Indians they weren't the Jews they were the Angels when God created angels he created tribes of angels and some of those tribes were put under Michael some were put under Gabriel and then the one whole group that was worship angels were put under Lucifer and by the way the only ones he got were the ones that were under him Lucifer did not get one host of heaven from Michael he didn't get one single one of Gabriel's none of them would believe the lies that he was telling they just wouldn't believe them they knew who God was so and he puts marks on angels so marking belongs to God there you go and Leviticus in the original scriptures that weren't have been translated fifty times and people in today's language have made a couple that say don't put tattoos on you and that's not what was said this was about the culture of the day okay it says do not mark yourself with the marks of the dead and I can just tell you what's coming to the body not just hair color in Psalms you should read all of them and there's a scripture in Psalms that says some will worship me and song some and dance and some will put my marks on them in this time I happen to know I've got some of my own children they got has had them creep marks and put them on them that represent him they're young people on fire for him and they don't mind sharing with any single person or individual no matter how wicked how dangerous how you know no matter what they got tattoos piercings everywhere it doesn't matter they will start sharing about the kingdom of heaven and what time it is and that they came from the very heart of God and lived in him and they will listen to them they listen to me because I have pink hair that's not even a threatening color okay little piggies and little babies are pink they're harmless it's also used on Valentine's Day is one of the colors that represents love I didn't pick my air color I didn't even choose to cholera had orders from headquarters because I would be speaking to the world and tweaking the body of Christ this is heaven culture if you made the rainbow why wouldn't they wear in heaven amen so this is a being one of one of the hosts of heaven and which is all tribes of angels these these there's more than one of these angels as a whole tribe named Scout this is a scout I'm gonna you're gonna hear me talk in some military terms because I mostly talk about the army of heaven and it talks about them through all the word even how they physically fought on behalf of Israel I think and if I'm correct Frick was it true that one angel slayed 85 thousand a hundred and eighty five thousand I'm so sorry guy whichever one you are up there one angel slayed a hundred eighty-five thousand astral people wicked army was coming against because people now mostly in this day they attacked the spiritual army of darkness we all know that there is a devil I hope you know there was a real devil some people now are saying there's there were never was a Satan there's people like him that's called deception there is a real devil Christ wasted him on hell and the third day he was kicked out of heaven his name used to be Lucifer it talks about him all over in the Bible I don't know how they get around that they probably leave those scriptures out but there's a real devil he hasn't me all the Angels that were kicked out of heaven with him had become so defiled it changed their features Satan is not creating demons he cannot create life and give life to anything he just can't do it he only can kill steal and destroy so all those Angels he reserved a few so they wouldn't look to file but they are that can appear to people that's why you need to know how to test any angel that shows up to you and says come and go with me you say are you of the Spirit of the Most High God who sent his son to die for the sins of this world and I may tell you if they are not they will either say nothing to you or they will disappear and then you evict him out of your room but whatever you do don't go with them and people are saying yes because they want to have an encounter and it's fine if you want to have an encounter and there are many angels right now who are sent to catch people up to heaven but you need to test them how many people got that say Amen it will happen eventually because more and more are present on the earth more and more people are having true encounters in heaven or true encounters with God's angels and because that happens the devil has to mock something to bring confusion to people he even did that in the past so that's why you need an understanding of the spirit round both sides are out there they're always active a lot more activity out there in the unseen round than the seen round and in this day we need to know and be empowered and empowers you when you know this it's not - but fear in you is to make you fierce against the enemy people it doesn't say that yes it does it says the violent take up by force spiritual violence rising up in you that having causes and encourages for you to come and come against the army use your weapons pull down strongholds / platforms bash those demons get them thrown in or dry place it's called pushing back darkness if we have power over all the part of the enemy no matter where they're operating what they're doing how they're doing it when they're doing it you you as a believer have power full power over them that doesn't mean hide in your closet unless that's your encounter room and he more in this more nor than ever before because of more spiritual things coming to light in the earth and people having encounters you need to know who you're having an encounter with and in when you're when you have that understanding you are empowered that means you have the right to say yes or no to them just because they come up and say come on doesn't mean you have to go okay now if Jesus comes in person and he wants to take you who take you anyway which has happened to me the whole time I'm starting to ask him he'll say why are you asking me you know who I am gonna go kid never mind but even I test him sometimes if I haven't seen him or know of them before a lots of times God will say I'm gonna send an angel this is what his name is this is what he's gonna be bringing you a message for me this is what he'll be talking about I'm like he could just give it to me his health but he's letting me experience encounters and the angelic are here to help us okay the ones that blow unto God care about you very much they've been given assignments to keep you in all your ways defend you protect you even that your foot there will be a time when your foot can't even be dashed against a rock I mean you won't be hurt or harmed this is what Heaven culture is taking you to because it doesn't happen in heaven say on earth as it is in heaven so Thursday from all harm all accusations there's no offense there's no anger no violence of any kind whatsoever no fear whatsoever everyone cares about you they like you they want to know you they invite you over all the time they want to go on tours with you that you you'll know and more and more the deep things of God's this place you can go through the chamber of underst which is where you meet with the father one-on-one in heaven every believer but next to their mansion has a garden with a key that Christ gives you himself and I've seen people where all the time when you go in there he comes to see you no matter how often you go in there Christ will come and see you so yes they want to know you and spend time with you it is a different way of life but we don't have to wait to die and heaven you exist to live down here we've pretty much been existing so if we're living on notice that they do in heaven that means we will exist now to live not be crushed and broken and left abandoned because even if I used to tell people if I lost everybody and everything I ever had and I just stood on a street corner with just me I would have everything because Jesus Christ I live in him he lives in me I know him I know his heart I know his ways I know his plans why would I fear anything because he is on my side this is what he meant when that scripture said why should I fear when God is on my side we need to live like this you celebrate all the time and if things are happening around you you change them you take power over the enemy don't wait for him to show up at your door you start taking it before anything happens those hosts will guard and protect you they'll keep things from you from happening to you they'll go in the traffic they'll move the traffic out of your way they're going the turbulence on the plane and move the turbulence away from you they'll give you favor with every airport person in customs and security at check-in in the restaurant you'll have favor in heaven they live like that so if we're living heaven culture then we get those benefits we don't even have to die in our body to enjoy it but we have been calling it in our father who is in heaven holy is your name now this is the part where you have to really start looking at the scripture in like parts okay we have identified that we're talking about the father say the father Jesus said there's none good but the father and he loves the father he wants us to know the father we came from him we're his offspring so you have just identified who you are saying this to in other words you're not saying these words to Jesus Christ who is our Savior who is our King right we're talking and Jesus said to say this didn't he so if this is something Jesus said to pray he was bushwhacking every Christian to do something that would call in a whole age on this earth people go the kingdom ages and anyone in the Bible quote the scripture with me you've just identified you were talking to the father okay that is his world his home in my father's that is a world called heaven are many mansions in that scripture you're identifying again whose house are we moving to the father's house so you are now talking to the father whom who has his house is the world called heaven and you're giving him an invitation our Father who is in heaven holy be your name your kingdom of heaven come what does that look like your will being done on earth just like it is in heaven that's a whole culture you're not talking about the culture of this world right now you're saying I want a whole new culture I want to live on earth like they live in heaven that is what you said and I'm be the glory you know we we have been talking to him for years and inviting him to come to bring the kingdom age there will be the kingdom operating on this earth in our lives seen in us around us us being blessed by it not being attacked not being sick our souls prospering handling the wealth of the wicked being above in every area of society of government of Education in the news media in arts and entertainment all of it to medical arena all of it because in heaven everyone excels their gifts are operating at the greatest level they create they invent and they celebrate all the time wouldn't you like to live that way on earth as it is in heaven so people say well you can't do that you just looking to go on earth as it is in heaven so we have entered into that time resurrection morning 2012 we stepped off a threshold of time and stepped in a whole new age on the earth God measures time by events so when an event that's been going on is full a fullness of time comes sometimes it takes into a new season of our life or something new God's doing but when it's time for a whole new age to come on the earth that is huge because when a new age comes to life drastically changes and many new things come and a new season you experience new things you see God doing new things but in a whole new age they got it designed for us to opera in to be known in this time as manifested sons and daughters that means it's going to drastically change so that's the time you're in we're not waiting on it it's here you have to say yes so this back to this being in I don't know if you you you can't see the picture between screen anyway I already told you that you can clearly see that I anyway it records the activities of Hell and then you know God doesn't have to do any of this but he loves to be involved in our lives he loves to engage the angels and to doing things for him because they have something to do and that's gonna make something that will happen to us or infect us in some way so this is one of heavens of one of the tribes called Scouts this angels name is scout the Holy Spirit told me and you can see the glory all over it I mean it's just good like the glory running up and down if I can get it on the screen oh are you I used to battery dying anyway Wow all the way up here you can see the light all over in this being and and he hides well in the clouds and then me look at that and they go well that's nothing because the enemy's brain is not as intelligent as the hosts of heaven because when they fell they lost some of their intelligence they don't know everything all at the same time they don't even know really God's plans for us but when the time comes for us to start manifesting they know there's a new time and therefore they increase their activity but it's not gonna do any good because of who you are what God is doing with us right now so listen listen if you can come to if you can look at the next one I don't know if we can actually see that and I don't know if it if you found did you find the unseen realm say yes if you can find where I have the portals and there see I have files I have probably over a hundred pictures of angelic and you can tell that it's a creature and I continue the thing about Gabriel's angels he's over most all of them look like us they look like a human most of the army don't look anything like us they have some kind of a body they have arms and legs sometimes some are just huge massive eyes with like facets in them and they have wings on those eyes that go around and record my eyes go to and fro on the earth isn't just God looking it's eyes that are part of the host that he's sending to record things yeah this is this is a real portal that this one is I'm Tara member where this one is this is Kansas you can see some of the faces they look kind of scary kind of if I had to call it scary right across from this marker do you see that head it's huge it's like it's huge it's right to the left of this on the corner you see it looks very fierce right how many people can see it say Amen okay that is one of the hosts of heaven you can see the eyes right eye sockets right below that you see his mouth kind of open mm-hmm yeah yeah it's right like the portal open portal looks like a heart see that yeah and you see eyes looking down from inside at the very bottom kind of to the left you see two eyes those creatures haven't come this is a portal an open portal to heaven and normally it looks like it has part of the rainbow around them this is not the Sun this is an open portal a true portal into heaven and these creatures are coming out to fight to go to war and there's one on the two i'ma say on this side also to the far right you'll see a face right here it looks like a lion kind of like a lion face well that there's one that looks like the moon you'd be surprised how many of the hosts actually have a head like the moon like a crescent and so these creatures I know it's makes a little bit harder that I can't show you I'm talking about at the top where the arch of the hearts are there are lion faces they have like pink outline to them they're not really big at the top of that but I just mainly wanted you to notice the portal we're gonna look at a couple portals that thing has passed through these are creatures of heavens army coming in to go to war and so that's called an open heaven and when Christ come into the heavens to open an open portal happened and I'm just letting you know he did that as a righteous man he said many times I come in the heavens to open because he was say commanding everybody say Christ was commanding say God said Khomeini me that didn't mean he was telling you to tell him what to do that meant you were saying what was gonna happen if we're ruling remember if we're ruling we command that's declaring and decree what you declare and decree that's not you saying God I want you to do this when you're declaring decrees going to happen I will be free I will walk in the light of God I will be a carrier of his wealth I will carry the glory I will do what Christ did and greater works you're declaring something that's not asking say not asking commanding it's important if you rule your kings and priests into your God we have the right to command because Christ did and what he commanded was always what God wanted because you know him so these portals open whenever God sometimes just does it sometimes when things new anointings new Mantle's right now these portals are opening releasing wealth because we declared it it's already happening so let's go to another one if you have another one who this I showed it a long time ago I used to have these prints with me and this is a being looking down like this and that light is the top part of his head you see a mustache and a beard and dark like dark hair all above him like up there at the top his forehead there's one eye there's his nose can you see it say Amen how many people can't ask me your eyes to be open do that portal you just saw never might judge you there were lines at the top of it looking in well well let me see these little small things you see right above here all those are Lions that came in there is a whole tribe there's a huge Lions head right to the left of this thing there's two eyes here his muzzle right here right underneath here this is the hair see the see right under here see the dark hair you see the dark clouds below this from here to here there's dark clouds that is this beings hair you're looking at who's looking down like this so you're looking at the top of his head can you see it now then you see a rainbow around his face like right here around his face you see that rainbow that's where the portal was and then right at the butt of that one part you see his nose a mustache and a beard he looks sort of like Jesus if you had that up right it would look like Jesus it's it's not Jesus though he is a guardian he's a guardian over the state of Florida and that wasn't Kansas that portal was the one in here is Kansas this one but if you look at your paper does that look like a heart do you see the rainbow kind of around it yeah see that's a different that's that's a real portal in Kansas but it looked very similar to the one you saw up there that look like a heart with the colored light around it and so right below where his head is if you look right below you see the face of that line that's looking full out so the so up here underneath here this from here to here is that being the top of his head's up here that's where his hair is right below us here is his forehead with the colored light running around his whole face like that that's his I blow here in the middle of that light is his eye and then below that is his nose and it's all looking down so that is uh this is the guardian angel every state has a guardian angel and below that his head is this huge line that came in with him and down down underneath here right above are all those small faces if you could blow that up those are all small lines and some of those were the ones looking in at the top of the portal so let's go to the next one and all these things came that you're gonna see it came through the portal and the next picture is probably here you go that being you just saw looking down picked his head up turned it and blew the breath of God out of his mouth and the very center of the picture well right underneath this thing is the Lions Eye you see the pupil see the round pupil okay so this is something if I think there's what the lines I underneath here underneath here is the other Lions Eye then you see his muzzle at the end of his muzzle is that angels head you see the whole head you see the forehead the eye sockets the nose you see that light that bright light in the middle is the breath of God he's got his mouth open you can see his chin under that how many people see that let me see your hands this is a real encounter and all the women on my staff we were all going to a women's conference at one of our friends places in Fort Lauderdale and about part of the way down this whole encounter happened and and we got these pictures so yeah so that's the same being you saw with the dark hair you even see the place right underneath here you see like it's kind of punched in cuz he picked his head up and turned it and he's blowing the breath of God out of his mouth and there's other beings and there's so many I'm not gonna compliment so this is this came from that one open heaven at four o'clock in the afternoon in Florida is not dark and so and the Sun wasn't even on that side it was over on the east this is looking towards the west close to floor so let's go do another one this is not the same being but this is a being that came through at the same time and if I outlined it from here is his head with a count he's looking forward like this his face is like a crescent this bright light you see like let me get this right underneath here is his eye and then you see his cheekbone which has got a lot of bright light on it okay can you see it so you're looking at a profile again you see his head looks like a crown on it like this his eye which is really big and his nose is sticking out from there and then his chin with his beard you can see him in his chest underneath his head or eyes like up above this part you see almost like eyes in the middle of his chest up about this part this this angels name is Zoey he has eyes in his chest like here are you giving me a pointer oh I don't mind doing it well you already know where it is okay you need a step stool okay okay where is where's this beard did you know that's not his beard you can't reach it alright why don't you point to his chest that has all the eyes in it let me have the pointer just no no no no no no no no show you this part I'll be out be back on the camera in a minute okay this part right here our eyes in this chest you can see the eyes you can see blue eyes all this is like this zigzag her eyes in his body okay over here actually is the head of a big lion his eyes his nose this is a huge lion that's with his creature okay in this creature I'll be careful at the cords okay this arched part right up here is his head the crown of his head he has a crown on that is his cheekbone that's all bright white see it there's his eye this is his cheekbone that's his chin with his beer right there and what he's going into looks like a bunch of peacock feathers you see the colors that is called the dark glory it talks about God hiding himself in dark clouds of glory all of this part looks like all on the left edge he's going into that glory it's coming down over his face that's white part of us over his nose and and on his face this creatures going back up into heaven through the dark glory and they groomed the living creatures there's you some new news that's actually what there's a whole tribe and I knew this but I didn't know an ancient Hebrew writings it actually talks about the Zoe that groomed the living creatures who don't know who the living creatures are read revelation 4 well it talks about the living creatures the four creatures around the throne of God that cry out they have eyes in their bodies and in their wings this creature was created to groom them and I thought what I used to see when I looked at it was I thought it was the head of an eagle it looks sort of like an eagle and God had me going to zoom in I literally standing here can see those blue eyes in his chest and so that's what he does that I can see the big lion head and this is what this appeared in the physical realm so we were seeing the the spirit realm exposed in the physical realm and you see all that green and blue to the left that's the dark clouds that God hides in the south man let's see if there's there may not be one more in that series are you looking at the host or the unseen the host okay I don't know if there would be another one in there or not is that the last one he's outlined I did it because so many people kept saying I can't see him can you see him now everybody should say yes that is what you're looking at and I outlined it because people kept saying I can't see it so this plate it's a plate that you see that has like the zig zags on the end all those are living eyes in his body and that's his face right there there's his beard he had this covering on his head but he had a crown on him and and so he's going back up into the dark glory and if you go back to the other one now you'll actually be able to see him you see him now that's why I outlined on your page whatever page that's on you see at the bottom that is a different one but still the same thing I could see them clearly but it was so amazed me yeah it helps to have them outline because then when you look in the sky you're gonna go WOW okay it doesn't have to look like a human face with human clothes wearing them when you look up in the sky sometimes you'll just see layers of eyes rows of eyes because the army when it comes to fight they can layer spiritual beings like 50 could stand where I'm standing because they're layered beings they're spiritual beings so anyway I didn't even know about that for several months and the hoster said you go back and look at that you're not seeing it yourself so I actually zoomed in on it and I went I got someone done I'm like this is amazing and the reason why I know their names and what they do is because the Holy Spirit told me so I don't know if so you didn't find the one that said the unseen realm okay there you go now he's on your paper can you see him better this is not a cloud people call them clouds this is a real literal spiritual being they look kind of transparent looking they don't have like a body like ours like this if you ever hugged an angel it would feel like hugging straw if you ever hug one and it really when you hug them even when people go to heaven if they hug them it feels like it's it feels like they kind of give even the powerful ones it feels like they're not made out of straw they have real bodies they use their arms and legs and that this one looks like a lion and his name is Rex he's part of the Royal Guard a tribe of angels that all look like lions and they're sent to guard the Kings the priests and the lords and people have said I see lines in the sky everywhere because in there and there and then their wings come from their neck you see his wings when he goes up that when one goes the other way he also has eyes in his bodies got one by his mouth there's an eye he actually has two eyes here right here he's got a flat nose like a lion and underneath his long moustache she's got long mustache and his hand is further down he's holding a scroll in his hand like that it's a living scroll to life and it's name is justice because justice is coming to divide of Christ he was assigned to earth during this kingdom time and he actually is the head of the army I command he also had orders in that scroll for me to command that scroll was sent by the father and from that time on when I got back home he said you have to invite the Royal Guard to come and be your weapon to put on strongholds for you I I didn't I didn't just hear these words he actually showed me the being that would be the head of the army so I started with a hundred I have a billion you know why I send them places they don't want to be bored okay if you come in an army you better be sending them all the time and you better give them commands if you wake up in the middle of night go outside and give them one like today from my hotel room they were waiting when I open those curtains I knew they'd be waiting and I had told them that I was going to send them into Denver to put on every stronghold of Pharmacia of marijuana the misuse of it and they were gathered so I couldn't even see the end of them they were always just waiting and so when I just said I take power over all the part of the enemy working with and empowering the use of marijuana the lies of marijuana the destruction it brings it takes you out of your natural mind it is not good for you no matter what they say I lived in the 60s I saw what it did it actually did ruin people's lives it caused so many accidents from people doing that and then driving and it doesn't do good no matter what they say it's just not good it talks about not using that in the Bible it talks about our not having anything to do with the necromancerr which is witchcraft is in the Bible and so I sent them to pull down and be strong expose every illegal especially the illegal use and I even told them you go expose every person group or place that is illegally used that stuff and then it said they make it clearly known expose what it really represents take the blinders off the eyes of the people I sent them to Denver from here and because they're really making it look like it's a good thing it's not a good thing and the police won't tell you they don't know how to handle it but they don't even know what to do with it because their shops everywhere and when they say fresh green they're not talking about salad and they're every they're everywhere cuz I just went through there and so I told them I and I'll and I mean one second later looked in the sky was just nothing because they had left they left instantly want to sent them so I expect things that start happening and I don't know if you have got is there another one after that that's a close-up so you can see his face can you see his mustache oh they'll go see out again you can see almost like fur or hair on him and you actually can clearly see the two eyes he's got two eyes he actually has eyes along the side of his face right here like those little groups of things their eyes I know we think they have to be uniform like we're going to have eyes on a creature no there could be like a whole mass here and then some here and they can see no matter where they turn their head they can see that that what the enemy is doing around them and you see that deep okay you see the deep dark blue in front of that angel and then what Rex is the one that looks like a lion if you go back there real quick you'll see a rift you see a rift that is not the natural world you're looking at through that rift that is what he came in out of and so usually if there's a it's still a portal it's just a different kind of a portal and he came in from there and then although all the rest of the sky was like a light blue if you can go back to the other one you'll see light blue around there's some kind of a light-blue off to the far left corner that was the natural sky but that deep blue around him is him coming in I actually have pictures of him my husband was with me goes something was coming in over there he's Scottish she's got five layers in his soul so he doesn't get excited about anything but fishing and he goes oh something's coming in over five storeys of condos this creature was bigger than those five storeys of condos and he came in flat and you could see him flat when they come in from the spirit realm the physical realm they're flat cuz they're spiritual beings and then when they fully manifest you see their whole appearance and then and I took a bunch of pictures of them and I was really glad I took those pictures and and and so that Scout you can always see the glory somewhere on them you can see the light of God on them and so I think that's enough I'm going to talk about one of the ones I don't know if they have oh wait there's Piper see him on your paper he sort of looks like a human I'll be taking too long doing this I hope not you know how many people don't know this stuff they don't understand their spiritual beings out there warring on their behalf he's gonna get the stick gotta go get the pointer oh that's his nose you plainly see that pointed nose right and then then his eyes see the pupil in his eye see the pupil oh yeah yeah right there's his eye there you go and the outline and again for some reason I get a lot of profiles of these creatures and you see those pieces of you see the streams coming up to him all these streaks of the of the light he actually and I'm gonna bring it back next time I come he came off of a transport from heaven that almost looks sort of like a thin top and began to spin and it spun him off in layers I have layers of him it's wild because God creates and liners remember so this is the stream which is left but that's him I have different layers of him coming on these streams I could actually picture the things spinning and these light waves started coming off and it was it was he was coming he was transported and deposited this was across the street of my home because remember the army I had asked to come they came and this is Piper and he's got a like a Scottish ham on his head see the plume it may not show you in here but because this is a spiritual being on the top of that plume our heads nothing weird say we serve a mysterious God say there are strange creatures in heaven but to heaven they are normal we are strange and he came oh I hope I know at one time I outlined the other one but he comes because the army came and he's the inspector of the troops he was there to inspect all the troops that were assigned to me and he pipes with a pipe like a little flute and his name is Piper and he inspects those troops and he looks huh he SC that points right there so anyway he's fierce isn't he he looks tough yeah and he makes those troops believe he's tough because if you had a sergeant that trained you in boot camp I promise you they didn't look happy or nice or even treat you nice because they were to whip you in shape my husband all the time talks about Camp Lejeune where he was trained in the Marine Corps if you swatted a mosquito you dog a six foot by six foot grave and put that mesquita in there and covered it up chat you're right and if one other troop laughed they dug a six foot by six foot trench and found something kill the mesquita and put it in there because they were telling you better not show one bit of emotions about what's going on or you will have the same punishment so those guys who train the troops or inspect the troops they have to be fierce they have to be focused and it's no different in Heaven's army we have armies because they have armies they have positions I trust you they have people that inspect the troops they have troop transports that bring the troops they have captains they have generals they have all kinds of Admirals in the Navy they have lieutenants they have positions of authority in the army and so does heavens army so you're getting a seat part of heavens army so wait if there's another one let's see it this one's a little bit harder to see but up in this left-hand corner if you look really good you can see a creature riding on the head of an Aragon in the middle of the picture you see a face this got spikes on his head spikes going right there see them and this head is sort of shaped like that he's got Troy he's got like diamond-shaped eyes move it over a teeth there's one what there's one and right across is the other eye it's got again white white white he's got like a mustache that's his head and this creature over in the left hand corner that looks like he's got a crown on his head and his eyes are right below it I / I you see the shoulder of his arm right over to the right of his face there's this whole shoulder like this like bent there's a shoulder on the other side and he's riding he's got like a kind of a leather skirt on right below his torso and his leg is on that part of the creature comes down and he's riding on that thing into battle can you see so that's an Aragon a different kind of Aragon there's actually another creature with him you can kind of see the face kind of next to the head of the Aragon and this was taken was at the beach just walking and talking and he was there writing in the sky under underneath for hours he was old above where I was at so they heavens real and they have real real real hosts this is trooper and coming he's he comes down you can see his head he's got a big eye up at the top of this white being that's his eye he's got a mouth almost like a beak coming out right here underneath his eyes right underneath his eye comes out of him right there and then the back around his head if you go up the other way that's the top of that going down there keep going right there's the top of his shoulder again you can see the shoulder and his arm his hand is made like this his hand is like this right down here by his side see the hand yeah see the opening in him it looks like stairs that dark partner meets his neck this an opening and out of him is coming heads can you see the heads coming out to the right of him come down right there go across to the right to the right right there's one and right next to them is another one like it at the bottom that's an angel go down down down I'll go to the right that white light that is an angel you see the streak coming he's coming out and there's heads although down his back go back to the top of his head and then go slowly down his back and you'll see faces keep going keep going keep going right there are some faces keep going there's a whole head keep going keep going right down towards the bottom a little bit more to the left teeny bit left see the eyes eye across and that is a nine that's a head so these are beings that have already come out of here this might be too deep for you but you better get ready for the deep because we are going into deep places this is this is not I did not Photoshop this I don't even know how to do Photoshop I'm too busy traveling and speaking and main character heaven but this is something again now this was in Kansas this was in Kansas and the creatures you see at the bottom that I've outlined on this page right below Piper those troops that's the whole line of troops hundreds of them made exactly the same in there and this is trooper that they came out of now the person driving me was a prophet and we were there in the middle of America to declare stuff and to declare different things and every resurrection morning I'm there declaring with my staff usually 8 a.m. when it's like really cold it takes me out of my comfort zone because I'm usually sleeping but so this creature comes down and he opens up and then the army comes out and his name is trooper because he transports the troops some of you thought this is way beyond wild but I thought this is what should be happening in church you should have revelation about the spirit round you should know what spiritual creatures are you should know what the army of heaven looks like and what their operations are that's where we came from you came from the world where they live it was never normal praise God so we're entering into times that aren't gonna be normal but when you begin to live in heaven culture it'll seem normal to you and you will begin to have encounters you begin to hear God speak revelation to you and so you need to understand he does operate in mysterious ways which means strange to us what God usually does isn't the way man does that that's what we can't get in our mind if it doesn't line up with our mindset we don't want it but God almost always does something that doesn't line up or even make sense to our head in the Bible he almost never did anything that made sense why rescue a whole group of people then send them into the ocean to be consumed and then have the army chase them dinner to the end and see what to die no he was gonna do something more he was gonna demonstrate and manifest his power on their behalf so to us it was a that's insanity to rescue a whole you know a whole group isn't a group of people then send them apparently into destruction and Moses had to be willing to stand at the edge of that water and hear God step into it and the entire water obeyed the command and parted and they walked not on damp ground not muddy ground but they walked on dry ground and in these walls of water were all the cysts sea creatures and all those things swimming in the wall of water that was held back by the angelic so there's one thing right there that man would have never done right so is there anything else because I'm gonna try to finish this one you can clearly see because I sketched dead now this angel is a regional angel he's overall the guardian angels of the western states yes and I actually know his name his name is jolt and he wars with lightning a lightning staff that's lightning coming off of him is coming off of all over him the glorious he again has what you would think and I saw him I was taken to the middle of the the desert in Arizona outside of Phoenix literally in the desert was carried I was about to go do a six state thirty-six meetings in six weeks in the West and God said I'm gonna let you see somebody who has authority some of the hosts of heaven where the host of them actually is ruling in that area pushing back the darkness and he is fights with the light my lightning power and he said he's right there now so I instantly just there and I was standing down from him he was huge I mean the mountains were behind him there's the mountains behind him he was huge and he had this lightening staff and it was alive and those feathers at the bottom of his out garment you see all have living eyes in them and and you see the symbol that symbol you see it in a lot of the North North American Indians you see that symbol on their tents on their blankets that came from heaven okay and inside that symbol are living eyes everything on him was alive his eyes were like triangular shaped even the pupils were triangular shaped like a lightning bolt and and off even that the tips of his wings you see lightning coming off of them and he had been fighting the demonic in the desert because God was about to do something new in Phoenix and and if you don't know for sure King's ministry is there and so I was going to go speak actually at her place I was going to speak I was being interviewed by her and that many of the tapings you'll see on my website calm you'll see them I also have revealing heaven calm and he said I want you to know who's fighting and when I got there they all got undone because I actually I'd sketched it took it to my artist at 11 o'clock at night and I said you need to refine this because I have to take it and I want to show - Patricia Camus people and they said that they had been having reports the authorities have been having reports of lights in the desert like lightning bolts but there were no storms and they didn't know what it was and so I said well I said this is what it is and so he was using the lightning Paragon to destroy the things of darkness that were trying to start over there and he probably was protecting her in her ministry because she was stepping into the supernatural at that time and and so he was sense her to protect and his name is jolt and we're gonna make a t-shirt that says meet jolt one of the hosts of heaven and none in the back will say who's got your back who's got your back okay cuz we got Heaven's army that's he's got our back and if there is it one more are y'all enjoying these God is wild these are the days of the wild things these are if you look if you look in the very center of the picture you'll see a skull just ahead I'm gonna show you with a stick I mean the very center it is a skull right there you see the whole head it's like right up there go go up further up further to the middle of the picture in the dark part right there go around way up there's eyes all the way around like a head down here's his chin and you see demons coming out of his eye sockets this is this is a demonic all of these are part of the army of darkness if you look over here there is a lion there's his mane and in his mouth he has a part of this being and these demons are running as fast as they can this is the lion's leg this is his body this is all his Mane right here there's his eye it's dark blue see it so this is one of the hosts they really look like a lion someone would look like literal lines he is attacking this demon right here in the sky and out of his the skull of this demon are coming many tiny mini demons this whole thing right here is a demonic this is the body of the skull this whole thing from here to here and there's the lion's mouth and you see that dark thing in his mouth that's its tail so he's attacking this is just a random picture I got the sky when it was out speaking somewhere so that's pretty awesome now I know this looks kind of scary but it's not this creature and again sometimes I need to outline this is his mouth roaring there's his eyes eye this is his head he has a staff what is some of the demonic that he has captured there's heads 1 2 all those were heads and he has been warring this is over my house again they were bringing their what they had caught they had caught the enemies they caught the army of the enemy the dark and have them there's another creature right now in here see and there's his head looks almost like a snail there's his body there's his neck he's a good guy and this guy has got a lightning staff and he's got all of the enemy that he captured taking him back up to half taking them to whatever they take them probably a dry place I didn't know that was on there that's that was pretty weird say the army is fierce because they're fierce against the darkness they are not pretty boys with harps oh this is a good one you're gonna see you actually gonna see a nut you're gonna see a witchcraft spirit in a minute I was in Mississippi we had a something happened in our meeting and a woman was there filled with witchcraft spirit and she was screaming when I started talking about the face of God I mean everything was fine I started talking about the face of God was like stamp of stone and this woman stands and screams like non-stop and I was ignoring it because the Holy Spirit said ignore it he didn't say the woman ignore it and so people are standing up rebuking it how are you and Jesus because they have a lot of witchcraft in Mississippi and those people know how to deal with it they're intercessors are powerful and and I mean it's not like just a little spirit of witchcraft I mean they have omens hung on people's property and lift lift on their doors and things written on the door of their houses with symbols and and they have driven a lot of them out of a good part of that because I came and taught him how to do it I showed them greater warfare but but this and I can't use that Jesus dick so we told it and after this meeting my staff got together one I'm not happy just telling you to leave that person and finally when the meeting was over she started heading down and I have a black pastor friend who lives in Memphis and we were in Oklahoma Mississippi when this happened and let me tell you when those women take their earrings off and their gold heels off you better get out of the way and my sister Jen was sitting next to her she goes if she comes anywhere near cat I am taking her down Laurie lavender and their precious people if you live in Memphis go to their church it's powerful they live heaven culture they live by revelation and they're powerful people but they came to hear me and so she did she wouldn't put him back on so when the meetings over here comes this woman down right and I'm walking over there and Laurie gets right next to me and I'm okay it's gonna be okay and so he didn't want me to make a scene because that spirit wanted a scene he said you're gonna hug her and release the anointing all you can and release end her and you say in her ear get out and when I did that you could see her whole face is like Jesus went it the spirit left and she was crying and weeping and then the pastor that the born-again CD was made in his church that was his church where that happened so he came down and minister to her loved on her and so we went back to our room our little quarters and I said I'm not happy telling you to leave them though lady we're telling her to get out of town and just four members of my staff we held hands always said okay you spirit of witchcraft get out of town in Jesus name and that was it so the next day we went into Memphis to look at some stuff and on the way back you remember we said to get out of town we're coming back into town from like this direction I'm a hand person we were down that way into Memphis and we were coming back into Okolona and and margaret was driving at me I don't ever drive because recently I did that in Mississippi it took me five hours to drive a two-hour drive of five hours I get off the expressway and got back on off the expressway and back on and Jen's going no don't go there but the exit was way over here and I didn't see it so I had kept going I had to try to go back that was back that way and that's what it's like to ride with me so I don't drive anymore I just heard from Elijah's people are his cat couldn't come by herself is she gonna run a car from the airport and drive to wherever that place is in Oregon and and I said I know that my person didn't get to answer I want just so you know down this I never drive I never come alone I would never make it there but I'll make sure my staff never contact you there's reasons so anyway we're coming back in from this part of town and this thing right here you're looking at is a whole head you see a tongue sticking out see that that right there I'm pointing at not that up over here where I'm pointing up here over over over to the left to the left keep going all the way to the left you see something that looks like a big chin and there's a slit I the mouth is open can you see it can y'all see it like you're stepping on stuff this is it right there there's a whole head right there its tongue nope over here it's right here see them the pointer nope over it's over that way right there I should people are laughing everywhere in the world entertainment like this y'all gonna give me a it's there you go that's his chin that's the tongue go to the left that's his tongue it smells is open go back out of the mouth up here going around the top of the head keep going you see the little lump right there keep going and there's the eye it's just a little slit I'm making a mess with this microphone he come back down where the tongue was yay keep going to the left go to the left up nope nope back that no Yelp you were past it you see when you went around the forehead go back to the forehead yeah go down down a little bit there's the eye nope there you go yay are y'all entertained oh well you will see the other thing without me pointing in anything don't show them yet don't show them yet so when I was driving do you think it's safe whoops - let me step on that huh good thing the angels are on me they're all going like this we will not let her fall so we will come in in and I went Margaret there's something in the sky so she slows down she's driving and it's just the long road she slows right and I'm like click click click click click and the Holy Spirit said to tone on it and he said that is that witchcraft spirit you told it had to leave town remember we're coming back into town it's leaving he said it doesn't want you to know it because it's embarrassed so I'm gonna remove what it's hiding behind it'll let you see the full face of that witchcraft spirit show it to them Dennis if you see it say Amen [Music] [Applause] see the tongue that was sticking out see the bump on the back of its head still there there's its long chin there's this tongue there's this nose there's this eye the little white spot and then go up around the top of the head and you remember that thing had had was a lump on it there is on the back of its head right there and that witchcraft sphere is screaming because it was exposed and I knew that it was leaving town because we took authority in Jesus name and told it it had to leave isn't that amazing yeah it was a bad day for them so there you see some of the darkness these are these are Gabriel's these are some a gay girls group they collect the worship and every time you worship today every time here there's so many angels with these beautiful vials about this high and they're lavender and they come up and they go like this and they come by and they keep all your worship they click the worship from everybody every person their worship goes in there they're actually not holding swords they're holding these vials but they're filled with the the worship it turns into golden incense it talks about your worship being like an incense before the throne of God and so these this is a stairway into heaven I literally saw the stairway this was on the National Day of Prayer in my city and God told me take my sketchbook and I was sketching the scene and cinnamon came up behind me went what is that and I want those are angels who said I can see they're angels but what is that right there that's a stairway to heaven I said when those vials are full door carrying up and pour him before the throne of God and it releases an aroma in an incense from our worship and I found out it was it was a rabbi he was dressed like he was Jewish but I didn't I didn't know what his title was so I wasn't going on he gave me his card and said when that gets done I want that to put in my office and he said I'm from such a such a temple if you ever get time I would like for you to come and speak and so there it is it's finished and and so that was from the National Day of Prayer man there were thousands and thousands are our city has a thousand churches in that and for probably now twelve years the pastor's of every denomination even Orthodox Jews and if they all come together the Messianic and Orthodox he we even have Catholic priests come and at noon every Tuesday at a business wwg a mechanical contractors who's he's a strong believer he holds this breakfast in his employees lunchroom it's about 300 people they all come and they all agreed to lay down their differences and they all hold hands and pray for a move of God to come to our city to bring the church together to work together on behalf of heaven and so so every time we have a National Day of Prayer is powerful and what you see down in the middle you see like columns and the middle one has like a red cloth like an X on it if you'll notice how they're dressed the Angels have their gowns and they are wearing a red sashes crossed like that and I know the persons they they heard that had this vision from God to create that you see the columns behind them they were actually saying that this is heaven this is what I having spot is going to be and they designed it exactly like what's behind them even to the point of putting the red sash on there I showed them this painting and so mmm heaven comes your your your worship is inhabited by God it is precious it is powerful when these angels travel back up to heaven they break holes in the second heaven and bash Satan's a Little Kingdom he set up there and break holes in it and break up buildings because these are spiritual things your worship is spiritual it's a spiritual weapon going to a spiritual heaven so it actually does warfare on the way up there so these are gamers and they're called couriers or courier angels [Laughter] Thank You Jen for your bit of humor that cloud was over our house and Jen did Photoshop it no a minion did not appear over our house I'll make that perfectly clear wearing a mustache and glasses but when your sisters writing children's books a children's author that's what you get that's her revelation of something in the heavens this is a pet portal if you look right above this black part right there's my thumb holding my cell phone up and we're driving in California on the way to do Francisco and the Holy Spirit said get a picture that cloud baked and then open it up I began to yell in the car oh my word there's a dog there's a cat there's a fish on the dog's head I see a horse's head I there were so many you see the cat to the right I mean it there's the cat is that a cat face right next to him to see the poodle you see the goldfish sitting on his head if God doesn't have a sense of humor what is that can I didn't do that I have been telling people trying to convince them that your pets go to heaven and not only that that this portal is your pets look down and see you on the earth and and and and and the Holy Spirit said get that picture and he said God said because you're willing to talk about them we thought you'd look we thought you show them and there's actually oh they do you see that poodle a cocker spaniel you see the cocker spaniel in the picture you see something standing on its nose it's some kind of little pet if you go down and over to the left you see like a golden retriever kind of a dog all the way down and keep going down down down over to the left laughs right there there's so many pets in that picture I think I counted 38 and that was when I was in Florida going down i-95 and we were passing into from Georgia into Florida and that pet portal was in the sky your pets go to heaven amen oh there's that picture that's in your and your booklet right here there's that picture right there and if you look see it looks like a heart again with the color around it that's a portal to heaven right above that is a bearded being looks almost like I call John back straight up from the center of the heart go back to the center of the heart and straight up in the in the middle and it'll over a little bit to laugh a little bit to laugh go right there that's his beard see the beard and then you see the face straight up in the middle where the look right there's an eye you went past his eye there's his face there's his hair right up from there is one that looks like Jesus right there there are 43 beings in that portal and I was standing on the little stoop that that black pastor stood on at the first school of Bethel school they had and the students wanted to explore the book of Acts and they wanted to see to get filled with the Holy Spirit and they weren't teaching that at that time and so they asked parem who ran that school can we pursue this and he said go ahead and pursue it and after pursuing pursuing it fell that's the portal the Holy Spirit came from it's still there from all those times it went from there to Azusa Street it fell first in the middle of America I went from there and that little black pastor was not allowed at the time to go in the room and sit down but parem knew enough not to not to mess with God's purposes so he said I'll let you sit out on this stoop and you can sit on the stool and I'll let you keep the door open so you can hear he got more than all the students in the school dead because of his hunger he sold totally gotten invaded with the Holy Spirit he took that from there to Azusa Street in California so this was a portal to open yeah and I and God let me get a picture of it so I'm standing looking up standing in that same spot even took a picture of the doorknob has so much glory in the doorknob but it's the same doorknob subject which of the doorknob and the glory is like coming off of what where he's held it open so he could hear truth that changed his life that started a whole movement of the Holy Spirit in our country Amen so that's that's the that's where I got that picture and put it in there so that's an open portal and let me see what time is it we're probably gonna happen Brooke yeah we're gonna have to rock it into the next thing so this is really just to acquaint you with the spirit realm around you it's more real than this natural realm and the way God created the natural realm was he spoke the word stepped out he took a scroll at first it looked like a drop of water because the River of Life flows from God he grabbed it and it was became a scroll he took it and he stretched it around the spiritual realm out in space and then that was the canvas for a physical realm that he could then put the planets in in the stars in and then God treated earth took one hand of water to put it on the earth where the landmass was one landmass and he and that one handful made the whole ocean and he made the earth and then before he remade it in verse 2 and so he created the heavens and the earth he he created you and birthed you from inside him he wants you to have truth and revelation so that you can be great for him in this time amen amen so I hope you enjoyed that we're gonna have is there something else I need to do before I do the laying on of hands oh okay we're gonna take up the offering and and either I can take it up or you you better are you sure you want me to take it I'm just gonna say when you invest in what God is doing it is powerful it you know we can give and it will be given unto you but when you give to what God is doing right then in the earth it gets multiplied even more because it's gonna go for his purposes and not just his purposes it's gonna be his will his way and this is what he sends to me he says if I send it I spend it and that's what I live by regardless of what I need or what I have to have I let God tell me how to spend it because you belong to him if you're giving it it's him sending it and if he sends it he tells me how to spend it and then I spend it where he wants it amen so if you want to give this is the time to give if you want to make checks that make it out to gateway gateway I'm not laying gateway on Mount Zion I'm sorry I'm yelling yeah why on everything everything goes to camp every day everything comes to me so if I know sometimes people I've seen people not trust places and they will walk up and give me money later you can trust this place okay you can trust them they are so hungry for revelation not many people would come and let me do this or even show you what you were shown because they would have fear that it was not true or that I was deceiving people I don't know how you can deceive people when you empower them bring them closer to God share who they were where they came from open up revelation in the Word of God tell you what time it is how to operate in it just be an agreement with God's Word that he gave to you tonight a man and so when you're ready we'll just go ahead and start taking it up so if you want to make checks out or give I greatly appreciate all of it I take seriously your giving of out of your own need especially we know in this world it costs money which is why the devil doesn't want you to have money well it's too late that's not going to work anymore it's a lie that we have to be poor to be holy you're holy because of the blood of Christ and almost everyone God used in the Bible either had money or he gave them wealth they were wealthy God loves wealthy people that love him because the money won't have you it's not money that's evil it's the greed it's the love of the money that's called green that's a flesh thing we talked about the spirit and the flesh greed is part of the flesh wanting to take over desiring things of the world just sometimes they already have stuff they just want more stuff because it's the spirit of greed they can't they can't stop doing it okay so it's about being selfish and wanting for yourself but if you want to help people to help empower them to bless them to build things in this time on the earth to help help support whole groups of missionaries send buildings there to be built on the property you know supply them the whole year they're there I'm not talking about hundreds of people are talking about one person can supply everything that whole group needs the whole time that they're there this is the time we're entering into where you will have wealth to go in and buy a city if you need it to for God he will he is going to buy up so many these major resorts I mean like ten star resorts that are not going out of business he's going to set up believers to go buy them transform them in and the orphanage is going to the streets and rescue 500 orphans put them in the best place they could live he'll have people ordered prepared to go in there and train them and teach them in the love of God they don't have to have little hovels to live in anymore because in this time we're gonna be demonstrating and representing heaven it's gonna be different we're gonna represent heaven heaven has the best there's no lack in heaven the best buildings the most beautiful landscapes the properties are the places to go to are the best of the best so for living on earth as it is in heaven we should have more do more and be boring man so father I thank you for blessing every person even because of the hunger they had tonight even because they stayed and didn't leave even if they didn't understand God I want you to fill them with revelation bring restoration to their families let them have encounters and counters with a Living God with the hosts of heaven God let them clearly see them over their home in the sky waiting to defend them to be sent on assignments god I thank you for increase in discernment and awareness of the spirit realm increasing and sound wisdom increase in every area of their life god this is the time for the more in every area for us to be above and not beneath because we live in Christ and he lives in us we're gonna manifest and demonstrate at the highest levels of authority with Christ in this world down long revelation on the word that the word come alive let it be a Living Word and a testimony in their lives god I thank you in every way to bless them and you will receive that say I receive it amen thank you God amen so we're gonna move this and so my plan is to lay hands if you've been here before I didn't importations it doesn't take as long I don't take five minutes to pray over every little person you're gonna all get the same thing you're going to get the same thing and it's all connected to understanding and receiving the right to operate in the spirit realm have revelation of the spirit realm have manifestations in the spirit realm that includes encounters and so that's what I'm in parting into you what I operate in I can impart and you've clearly seen I know something about it so that's what I want to impart to everybody here and I will stand in one spot and we have a line like the lunch line what we'll do we'll have people come up this side up that side and go down the middle yeah and what I'm gonna do is you'll walk up to me and I'll just impart it to you and then I'll turn around and part it into them and then you can go back I guess either are they done you can go to the products table or you can wait i bless everybody we've already blessed you so don't have to do that and tomorrow morning what time ten o'clock we have another service tomorrow probably something completely entirely different whatever it is will be amazing probably new revelation on heaven or even something for you so I just know it's gonna be good so are we gonna start with the back and everybody just comes up yeah they come up like you're going to launch okay you're going to come to get dessert so one behind the other okay and then you'll stop here and you both you'll face this way you'll face this way and you come all the way

has written on his side he is the king of spiritual kings and the Lord of spiritual lords that are the body of Christ who have said yes to him this is the holy time it's a great time it is a powerful time to demonstrate and manifest for your God you cannot remain the same you are not the same for all who hear this word you must say I'll receive it those who have not been running after this you get on that track and you run after it you must choose to be chosen no one can stop you from doing that yeah no one can stop you from putting your crown on but you must not look or listen to the doom and gloom you must not be into escapism but rolling this is time for operation we've had revelation it's been revealed to you the plans of God who you are where you came from and even your future you have

speaking amen [Music] amen we thank you for your presence [Music] the stand before the throne of God is a powerful life-changing [Music] your flesh dies I know a lot of people say you cannot see the face of God you will die you're right your flesh will die every thought you had of what was important what was great who you are what plans you had what you thought about others even those who attack you it dies it's like dust it's like it never existed when you're standing before the Holy One and you burn for him because you're burning with him our God has eyes of flames of fire that's his passion for all of us even those who don't know him he loves them we all came from him we chose different paths in our lives some of us just ran immediately after him some took the time to do it but they are now running after them but even if it's at the very end they run after him we all will receive a great reward he does not want you to remember your past when you did not belong to him neither does he want you to remember or talk about others paths their past before they belong to him we cannot repeat a matter we cannot speak against our sisters and brothers if they're born again now God remembers none of their past why can never happen we cannot hold things against people if they repented God and given their self to him it's like God said you remember it no more that means you act like it never happened that is love love is not just loving God and hating others that's not love because if he sent us to love and to be just like him then you have to forgive even if people have not said something to you even if they haven't said I'm sorry it happened you have to act like it never happened love does not remember that walking in real love is living the truth and loving others we cannot approve or agree with their sin not ever sin is sin last night he had me explained that making mistakes that's different than sinning making a mistake you just say I'm sorry that's an apology okay so you can apologize for things if there was no sin involved you don't have to repent for that but we have to be like him that's why he died he died to multiply himself it says don't think it's bad to count yourself equal with him or he would not have said we are joint heirs when the father said and the son know ye not that ye are gods they weren't saying that we were the god of everything they were saying that we are in their family we are many ones many and what they were saying was you have the right to have authority in the spirit realm you have the right to have power over all the part of the enemy you have the right to stop the storms to stop the earthquakes to multiply food to call those things to be not as though they were we can do that we are the father sons and daughters we're joint heirs with Christ he is our bridegroom [Music] we cannot say that we're sinners saved by grace anymore because you are not a sinner and if you say that you're talking about your past he does not want you to talk about your past if you talk about your past you will stay in that place and if you talk about other's pasts that are now believers you will stay in that time our words are precious but they're powerful we cannot ignore what the word says about our words everything he made he spoke into being you speak things into being whether good are not good if people are continually bashing you and hating you you have to forgive them but they themselves are putting themself into place they're not going to want to be in because there are consequences to sin even believers who do that are putting yourself in a place they won't want to be in and I pray for God to have mercy on them I've had to forgive a lot and act like it never happened even though those people may not want to even accept that that I pray for them for God to have mercy on them to forgive them for what they say against me or accuse me wrongly of because I tell you the persecution is the evidence that I am doing right if you're being persecuted God said count it as evidence that you're standing in the right place with him and he does not hold any of that against you and I even tell people don't even write it down what people have said against me I don't want you to write it down I have forgive them I want you to act like they never did it that's true forgiveness because then you won't repeating it later you won't be repeating it you really have to be like that if you're gonna represent him you can't decide to be that way one day and then walk in the flesh the next day when you do that you are stepping back you can't go forward in the kingdom making conquest for Christ crushing the darkness pushing it back speaking to the water the land the air if you're doing that going forward and then all of a sudden decide you're just going to get in the flesh and blasts people crush people with your words you have a step back into the flesh you stopped you stepped out of the spirit walking in the spirit you step back in the flesh this is life this is death you speak life you speak death you draw a life to yourself you draw death to yourself if you keep doing that you will not be fit that doesn't mean you won't be in heaven that doesn't mean he won't love you that means you are not fit to go forward and rule in the kingdom because when you do that there's really no forward motion this is what you're doing you can't go to the next level of glory if you're doing this all the time you're not going to be a good witness if you're doing this all the time people will not know or even believe that you belong to God if you love them one moment and then you're bashing them if you love strangers but you're bashing your own family you tell about Christ how awesome he is then you repeat everything wrong that your family members are doing you are going in the spirit and you're stepping in the flesh because your flesh wants to do that when you're walking in the spirit and going forward you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh and the more you walk in the spirit you begin to walk in his ways and you let him have his will and when you begin to do that consistently he will then give you his own thoughts you cannot ask for his thoughts you can ask for his way you can ask for his will and only when you begin to walk in that will he give you his thoughts and you want his thoughts the more you have his thoughts the more you will know him and understand him the more you will want to be like him and not yourself and what you actually becoming is the real you that is not touched or controlled by the flesh that then cannot be touched or controlled by the enemy because the enemy cannot use a dead person so when you die to yourself to your own will to your rights to your opinions to your attitudes when you die to that you get filled with him and the enemy will run from you because you have died that is a good place to be if I ever have a school it's gonna be the school of dying and if you don't come dead we will kill you because I love being dead when your dad things can't penetrate you the enemy can waste his time all day long trying to convince you of something and you can just flick him away and he will run people not waste his time on you trying to use you or control you he will have no control over you what we allow is what we have right now what we have done with our own will and chosen with our will makes us who we are right now as a man thinketh in his soul so is he if you don't like you change it say something different live differently don't let people you know what that means but it says got no me and take your crown that means if you let people wound you or hurt you or put fear in you your crown is sliding off your head and you let man do that man's words are not supposed to hurt us or control us we belong to the Living God we don't listen to hell we don't speak hell's language they have one language just called profanity if you have an issue with it get rid of it because what you speak here will draw the light or the darkness to you fulfilled with the light of God and you let darkness get in when the enemy comes to check you out he'll see gray you don't want him to see gray in use you cannot mix the light with the darkness it says don't hide your light how do you hide your light you're letting darkness in this is a holy time it's an exciting time it's a powerful time it is a humbling time if you all come believe before God then you don't have consequences this is a time of blessings this is God's time to bless us this is our time of great wealth great excitement great prosperity joy celebration creativity that's the time you're in right now we're not living in the past anymore we're whatever people judge us judged us as we begin to believe that God validates you not man there's a lot of profits that really only hearing God they may hear a word and give a word but if that were to crushes somebody that's mixed with man if you don't say humble before God especially as a prophet and you get filled with yourself and people begin to idolize you that voice that you hear gets really thin and you begin to mix it with your flesh and the word sounds good and it sounds right but what kind of spirit is this person walking in we can't let self rule us we all have wills we have a will we have a choice he made us that way on purpose even the Angels have a will the Angels have a soul they had to choose were they going to follow God or Lucifer every one of them in heaven was tempted and he won one third while he lived in heaven while all these dangers lived in heaven they knew God they knew he was a creator and yet they chose the lie and when you choose deception you become so deceived you can't see that you're deceived people believing these messages that say you can freely send all you want to and the grace will cover is alive from Hell and sometimes you can't convince them because they had said yes they have said yes the people have said yes I can live any way I want to it doesn't matter the blood of Christ set me free you need to keep your discernment sharp you need to stay in the word you need to have a time with God time with the Lord on purpose if you have to set a clock and say I'm meeting with you tonight at 10:30 and you go sitting-room and you wait and just say I am here if you have to do that for seven months two years three years I promise you one day he's gonna walk through the walls and you will see him face to face whatever it cost to know him it's worth it but in running after him you cannot abandon your family when you go to heaven this is what God will say to you he will not say how many people have you won he would not say how much have you given away to others he won't say that he'll say did you love your family well that's what he's gonna ask you the ones he gave us and put us together he chose before this earth was made who your family members would be he put you in a lineage he made you a generation of something and we are accountable for how we treat them we cannot force them to receive Christ but you have to love them you cannot enable them to stay in the place they are if they're in drugs or pornography or even crime don't give them a place to live with you you will enable them to stay right where they are when they're old enough to know better and understand and they don't want to go by the guidelines the God has given you to live by then they should not live with you it's true we had many people come and stay with us and if they didn't want to go by the guidelines God has set for our household we had to ask them to leave because they'll bring hell with them and you'll be battling it all the time so make sure you're hearing God clearly if he said you help this person and then ask him how do you want me to help them because some of this some of us have big hearts and it's hard not to just run get them and bring them in because you have such an awesome atmosphere presence of God in your home but you want to maintain that and if they're if they're saying yes to your help they should be willing to attend church they should be willing to read the Word of God they should be willing to allow you to pray for them and if they won't do those things then they don't have a right to be with you amen see if you have college-age kids that come home and bring their drugs with them don't let them stand at the door and say we love you but that cannot come in you cannot invite your friends over who are wicked or living evilly because you're helping them to stay in that place my mom would just say I'm giving you to God and he can help you but you cannot stay here if you cannot maintain this atmosphere that we have here I had a great mom was she's still here she lives with me she's still my mother although I'm 66 I'm still her daughter she absolutely loves my husband he is the head of our house right now which is very challenging right now since we all live in our office I kept telling God I wanted office is good change your home into an office you put everything in storage that is yours personally and you make this look like an office and we had 14 staff every room and that place is the office even our bedrooms have desks in it there are no beds in there we sleep on sofas or nice lounges but we obey we already know the place that he's going to give us a beautiful place beyond anything we could afford and we know he's going to give it to us but we obey when you set something so make sure you know what you really want when you ask him and not only that we have the staff around us all the time like running our microscope would you like to move 14 people in with you if we go off somewhere and we can't even say we're going back home we're going back to the office it's his office he can do what he wants to there that's why he trusts us because we've laid down our own desires and our life for whatever he wants whenever he wants it wherever he wants it so it's wonderful to share beautiful things to people about how grand and fill with splendor and not just peace but the absence of evil and fear heaven is it's wonderful to talk about these great days on the earth that is for everyone all of his children in this time he is offering you to live on earth as they live in heaven it's called heaven culture it's a new culture coming to the earth not created here but birthed from heaven and sent here for us to tell and show what heaven is who he is and who we are and when you choose to live that way you live free from sin free from lack free from fear free from the enemy and heaven comes in partners with you the angels are seen all the time in her home and around our home by people by the neighbors who aren't even Christians they either change or move really today my message for you is how to live heaven culture which also means to partner and command the army of heaven heaven did not create an army to protect itself god never created the army to protect him he made them he doesn't need their protection he made them for a purpose every tribe of angels angels are made in tribes some of those tribes are under Gabriel some are under Lucifer and some were under Michael my friends are the ones under Michael I know some of them by name because the father introduced me or jesus introduced me our Holy Spirit introduced me this is what happens when you become the friend of God you become a friend of heaven they celebrate your life because they know you're gonna speak only truth that you will forgive no matter what is said or done against you you will bring life and hope wherever you go that the glory will wash over people the anointing will wipe out the evidence of hell and hell will burn if they touch that anointing you know things about the past before the earth was made you're shown things about the future even the new earth God did that with many of his friends my dad was God's friend I found out about the Father the Son and Holy Spirit from my earthly father and his mother and we have seven generations of us who knew him most of them are living in heaven right now they wanted to go to heaven the other thing that the Lord is offering is if you want to remain till he comes again this is a new time a new time when the supernatural beyond your imagination will happen there is not one human on this earth that can gauge what the presence of God the Father does when it touches something but we will feel that on this earth all flesh will feel it that'll be a new day you've ever wondered about the baptism and fire it has not happened yet because you will know when it does you the day the Holy Spirit moved inside of you packed up his stuff and moved in you knew when that day was you knew when Christ became your Savior and then if you loved him to be your Lord that's a whole different thing you knew when that happened so when you get baptized in fire you will know it you will not have to ask someone do I have the fire of God because I've only had a measure of it I still remember the day the month and the year that happened to me when I received it I was in church and I was thrown and hid the usher behind me and through both of us back three or four rows into the congregation it burned me like a blowtorch it burned everything off the walls of my heart that was not God it took away the memory of some things that I didn't want it catapulted me out of this world into heaven my spirit man was taken out of me and it was taken back in time it was like you see on Star Trek or Star Wars when they go warp speed I watched he takes you back in time and we were flying at such a rate all I could see was light shooting at me Shh and I felt myself traveling it's the only time every time he catches me up in heaven I'm here and then I'm up there and he was taking me back because he was blessed that I had obeyed and said yes when he asked if I wanted that and for two weeks I could only speak in tongues my body was in the church shaking and they locked me in with a security guard my pastor was wise enough to not touch me they left a note stuffed up in the sleeve my daughter when my mother comes to and can crawl over to the side call this number my dad will come and get her guys probably they're like 10 hours or 12 hours my body shook the whole time it was the fire on me it's one of the evidences yo shake you'll burn your body will get so hot it will burn all fear out of you it'll burn out the fear of the face of man you'll burn fear out of the face of the enemy it will make you so bold you stand in the highest mountain until everyone around you about him all I talk about is a father son Holy Spirit heaven the future the new earth our weapons he's given us crushing the darkness not tolerating the enemy changing the atmosphere speaking to the ground so produce can come up speaking to the storms and the earthquakes and the tsunamis and avalanches even the fires it doesn't matter it can't a pulse you into a whole new place where you fear nothing because that fire you're gonna be baptized with comes from the heart of the Father the consuming fire that burns in him and outside of him that the Lightning shoots out of you may expect that to happen to you one day it's didn't somewhere a lightning bolt start shooting on you that's fine with me if he wants to do that I don't mind I don't mind you're not the same person and I only had a measure like a drop when that fire touches the people on this earth they're either gonna run into God or run to get away from it the enemy is terrified of that day he tear he's gonna be terrified he's gonna lose a lot of those who followed him a lot of the supernatural be seen openly angels will be seen everywhere moving and doing things with heaven really is invading this earth and then the veils gonna be ripped away and the spirit realm will be evident there's the convergence of the spirit realm into this natural realm it's gonna happen and no one can stop it from happening I'd rather be operating in it than be ignorant of it that's why we get baptized and fire it is literally a separate baptism the Holy Spirit looks like he's on fire all the time I see fire trails all the time in my house but when I go somewhere and sit and get up I see fire on that seat everything I touch I release it into it it can't be erased it can't be washed off it can never be watered down it's an eternal thing this is what he wants for everyone this is his passion for everyone to walk in that place I'm not so special that I have something you can't have but I chose it I chose it every time he asked me something I said yes so if you play with your foot half way in the world and half way in heaven you're not gonna go anywhere because you're also like this you get pulled from this side then your friends are something influential to go over here or you watch a horrible demonic movie with graphic violence profane language and sexuality you're gonna be pulled way over here because it goes in your soul what you watch goes in your soul well you here goes in your soul what you say goes in everyone's soul that's in hearing distance it goes in your own soul you have layers in your soul so whatever you Lao on those layers that get stored there that's why you can remember things your your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choose to do or not to do to say or not to say to hear or not to hear you're the right to tell anybody who's using profane language I'm sorry but you know I don't listen to health language and I'd like to spend time with you but but you know I have to go because I'm guarding my soul I let God use my soul if you'd like to do that let me know because if you stand there and just allow and allowing allowing it you're filling it in your soul eventually it will come out of your mouth amen so this is a new way to live it's a lifestyle change you're not here getting a just a Bible meeting this is not something just to try to remember some scriptures that's not why I'm here I already did that growing up the word lives in me it comes out of me all the time because I put it there but I've guarded my heart and my soul for a long time and I realized even in high school I didn't have to be around people that did stuff I was never part of a group or a clique I didn't do drugs that happened started in the 60s when I was in high school I didn't tolerate it and they found out real soon if they asked me they would never ask me again so I set a boundary boundaries for myself I wasn't forced to take those boundaries but I set them for myself and I stuck to them because I realized even back then I knew there was a god I really believed you saw everything that I did or thought and I knew my own angels because I'm a seer we're with me all the time they live with you give them some slack okay watch something good say something good someone wants to fight don't fight with them your angel will be cheering you on and applauding you for speaking life when they're giving you death and do you know that when someone's bashing you to your face you begin to say how much God loves them you're piercing their soul with those words and those words won't leave their soul and there's something in there that can fight the darkness in them I've seen people in these fights domestic fights or just fight somewhere you know screaming at each other little demon sits here and pricks that person who's angry or upset and says to them I hate you I can't stand you I don't ever want to see you again and out of their mouth I hate you I can't stand you I never want to see you again and when the person across them starts yelling back they're doing that because this demon jumped to the other person's over one little demon this big they'll prick them and give him the answer and the answer will shoot out of their mouths and escalates and then they're screaming really horrible things and all is this demon jumping back and forth picking them laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing that they are now controlling those people whether they are a believer or not you give permission so don't do it no matter how hard it is turn around and walk away because you can stop that stuff we have a choice to participate or not participate these are all keys to walking in the spirit the morning you choose God's Way and not your flesh our man's way the more you learn how to walk in the spirit in this in walking in spirit is more important than having encounters being taken to heaven having all the wealth of the world given to you having great influence over people being in a high position it's more important to walk in the spirit than any of those because in your life God can use in great ways and you have the most unexpected things happened to you because you're walking in the spirit and you're not fulfilling the desires of the flesh amen because what you get in return is worth everything it's worth everything you live in his presence all the time your discernment becomes extremely sharp and people won't be able to lie to you you'll know what they're thinking before they say something jesus knew the thoughts and intents of everybody's heart when it talks about the heart in the Bible they're talking about your soul why do they do that because you're a living soul you are a living soul people have described their self many ways and held army but when he made add-on what did he call Adam a living soul when we lived in God we we had a soul but we didn't need to use it we need to decide where are we gonna live what are going to eat what are we gonna do we didn't have to make in those decisions he was our world he was our very place of existence and him we lived we moved we had our very being but when when Adam was formed and the in Christ made him the word made him when God spoke the word made Adams body and then the father leaned over and breathe Adams little spiritual being into his nostrils and he became a living soul who would then be accountable for his actions his choices what he was thinking what he was doing what he was displaying because the other part of your will is what you display in your emotions so people know what's in your soul and one day the father showed me people walk up and they'll go what's in your layers they won't say what's in your wallet they'll be talking about the layers of your soul if you're displaying something that is not displaying haha you're you're enraged something or you just try mashing people or you're spewing not heaven all over the welcome to go so what's in your layers because what I see is not God because one day at least all the body will know how their soul is made and the Father said it will change the way the body of Christ lives when they realize what they're allowing in there is causing them to think or act a certain way and you can change that you made trauma that wasn't your fault you were innocent of it but it still was recorded in your soul even if that abuse wasn't against you and you saw what that was recorded in your soul and it can control you for the rest of your life if you let it but you don't have to let it you can choose with your own will to loose that trauma from your soul like it never happened because living heaven culture means you're using the keys to the kingdom every day of your life this is a lifestyle he wants you to have any lifestyle if you can live on earth as it doesn't happen that means something is going to have to change is that right we had to have new things to understand how we could put our self in that place and not be affected by hell or man the main way you do that is to keep all their junk out no fear no offense no unforgiveness no drugs no bashing no doom and gloom no fear at all no one's words that are being said to you no matter how bad they are you loose every word they spoke every word sound image frequency thoughts or actions of hell or man you can loose them from yourself all day long if you have to and you'll walk so free and your life it will be like you're living in heaven they have a protocol to do this you get filled with grace every day well I have grace I'm gonna be saved yeah you are saved you have eternal life right but there's another kind of life you can live - it's called abundant life there's great fun dn't life if you know living in abundant life you aren't asking for that grace where is it in the word or my throne of grace to find Grace and help in time of need you need help when someone's bashing you you need help when you solve some traumatic thing or some actions or images that you didn't want to see what you see goes in here does it say the eyes are the window to the soul that wasn't just a remark that was truth so your own self what you choose to watch you're gonna be held accountable for that you don't want a lot darkness in the father said this to me one day it's not that people or businesses or churches cannot win but somebody in leadership or chose to let darkness get in it will affect you it'll affect your whole life if you're the head of your household it will affect your whole family because then you're carrying it with you and if you minister and you got it you're giving it to people if you're raising the family it's going to affect everybody in there because you allow things of the enemy to come in if you watch horrible things on television when your kids go to sleep you still let the enemy come in amen we allow or don't allow if you've been doing that go home open the door your house and you dipped all the enemy that you have let in there I'll go in people's home sometimes and I'll see like demons standing right next to the television they're not visitors they're residents because of what was continually watched in the home if you ever buy a home that someone else lived in make sure you cleanse it because the atmosphere remains you're moving into it it's there I don't go into a hotel without kicking everything out of the entire hotel and every room of every every room in the hotel no matter where I'm staying I'm not living with hell you don't know what they watched in those television you don't know what they did in those rooms you don't know what they said in those rooms because I can go to a place and hear words that were spoken for years ago friend of mine brought to me - let me see their new school facility and it was where the offices were and the wherever I can't remember a lot of human man things but it's where you come in to sign in you know where they read stuff the offices whatever I went in there and I heard prayer like I've never heard before I had images of people laying on the floor crying out to God like hundreds out there it was a huge place they're crying out to God calling in the move of God calling hope for the people that were there and crying out for their families and I said what was this place before they said well it's all remodel them and I'm not talking about the Tilton what was here what was done here they said why and I told him what I saw and they began to cry there but this is their 24 hour of prayer house all those prayers that ascended to heaven were also still there so words remain and some of them you wear on your garments the Bible says do not touch a garment spotted by the flesh people come in my office I see words on them I hear words that they weren't saying then my people that my staff know that if I sit in their chair I'll hurt every word they said the night before I will see every image of what they watched the night before because the more you become like Christ you know the thoughts and intents people's are and sometimes you wear it on the outside of you it's a garment it's been spotted by the flesh so if you buy stuff from the thrift store and I'm saying that because I love to go treasure hunting I don't have to but I love it I will cleanse everything I buy whether it's a trinket or a piece of clothing or anything else that I take from there I cleanse it for the kingdom I pick it up I cleanse this for the kingdom it removes everything that was ever spoken that was in the presence of something this is what the spirit realm is all about this is why you need to recognize the spirit realm is real and you don't see it with your physical eye but it's real and things remain that you release in that spirit realm it's wrapped all around this physical round when God when God was in heaven there was nothing but his home his world called heaven there wasn't anything there wasn't the planets there wasn't this earth there was nothing and the word would step inside the father and he would go somewhere where there's nothing and the father would speak and the world would step out make it that's why the word says there wasn't anything that was that wasn't made by the work he was called the word because he took his words and made them that's how that's done when he said Jesus said to the Father you and me and me and you that's what he's talking about they went someplace together and created together but the spirit realm is the original round it's not just the other realm it's not just some kind of round it is the permanent eternal realm that existed before this physical world was here and when God spoke the Lord the word there was a little drop of water and from it he pulled a scroll and he took the scroll and opened it like a curtain and wrapped it around the spiritual realm that's why at the end he said I will take it and fold it away like an O garment he's talking about the physical realm talking about the plan that's this earth people don't like it when I say there's gonna be a new words you should celebrate if God's gonna make it it would be better than this one and people go oh no the very core the center will remain it doesn't matter he says he's folding it all the way like a garment you know why he knows where the ends are and he'll just fold it up and go away and create a whole new thing he knows that things remain in that spirit realm and people always talk about well you know my dead relative is living in my house and they turned the lights off and I bump things no that is not your dead relative no one remains on this earth when they die they go one place or the other their body may die and be buried but their spirit man which is very much alive remains either in heaven or in hell and I've seen both you want heaven because in heaven you just to live and hell there's not even existence let alone living it's as real as heaven is and what we say and do with their life will attract one side or the other that means your angels are with you all the time but if you're doing something wrong the demons are laughing at your angels this is a real life this is this is truth you want truth you couldn't get all the truth that's why we're held accountable and the thing is when you begin to walk in the spirit you have learned the joy of obedience when you walk in the spirit there's not consequences it's a place you've lived in John was Indy say it loud on the Lord's Day so he wasn't in the flesh he was in the spirit that's when you heard and saw the door open and the voice all that that was in the spirit when he was walking in the spirit he probably wasn't even on the Isle of Patmos he was the closest disciple to Christ he got as close to him as he could he wanted to be just like him and this was one of the sons of thunder who couldn't wait to fight with his brother over girls he was so changed by Christ by following Christ believing Christ he believed he had risen from the dead remember that John the Beloved the one Christ loved the one who loved Christ I love all the little tags he gave himself didn't even say John the one who loved Christ the one whom Christ loved where he loved all the disciples but the one who stays the closest gets the most of him he even took John back in the past how do I know because he couldn't make that statement John couldn't state make that statement the Word was with God and was God and there was nothing that was made that the word didn't make he would not have known that unless he was shown that he also knew the word became flesh he knew who Christ was before he was Christ still same being but the word was all spirit he didn't have flesh on him he didn't even look the same Satan did not recognize him he kept trying to figure out who he was do you realize that even on the Mount of temptation he but they didn't know who he was but he was trying to find out because his features weren't the same as when he was the world because John became a friend not just a disciple did you become God's friend he shows you things and he takes you places he always did that in the past he hasn't changed he still does it amen so that's why we need to be accountable and really care not feel like we're being commanded to do it or forced to do it guys drink some water one day I believe I won't have to eat or drink I've only eat of him and drink of him and heaven you don't have to you eat because you want to not because you have to even God likes to eat does she Christ Christ got ruined by the sweets his flesh wanted the sweets I don't think he much cared when he was just in the spirit all the time but when he came to this earth grew up like we did he fell in love with sweets blame your sweet cheese on him we are joint heirs with Christ I don't know very many people that don't like sweets I will raise my hand who likes sweets let me see your hand chocolate especially if they had money in heaven it would be chocolate and they have chocolate because I have had it I've had pizza and chocolate ice cream in heaven [Applause] whether it's barbecue or steak salmon fried chicken without the fixin everyone in the South loves fried chicken I may have been born in the north but I've been raised in the South y'all I do like fried chicken I eat it in moderation eat everything in moderation choclate cakes yours good the special things in habit well I only talk about the things I like I I do know this it is so worth it to give yourself to Christ and gain heaven and the new one will be even better I've seen the one that's here let me tell you there is nothing that can compare with it down here especially the food no weight gain no food allergies don't have to worry about gluten-free stuff or the fat or the sugar amen it will not affect you in any wrong way I will say this to start with they don't kill animals to feed you in heaven those animals would be yelling at you you are not taking my life your pets if you're feeding yourself where's my food and I'm not eating on the floor anymore God has the greatest sense of humor because all your pets are there and yes they will talk to you being nice to them they will have good memories of you they're taking over your mansion whether it was a zebra a chimpanzee a goldfish your 20 cats every raccoon you saw dead in the road and you said you poor thing it went to your mansion you will have many more than you had on this earth but there will be plenty of room for them all oh I we haven't I've already seen Charlie in heaven I saw our pet alligator in heaven yep charlie yeah max the duck Maggie that you can I can go on and on I don't have enough time today to tell you about our pets and you got 15 kids you got a lot of tats my dad loved nature too we gave away alligators alligator turtles all kinds of owls those weird black birds that peck holes and everything pileated woodpeckers Thank You Holy Spirit we had him in our house they were in a pen we made a big mistake by putting newspaper between the pen and the wall they thought the print was bugs we had about a thousand holes in the wall when we finally gave them to the zoo and they were like this big we got him this big Thank You months of the zoo we kept giving to the zoo all the time so all the light all the light is a substance in heaven everything is made out of light in heaven your clothes your own being is made of light God is light right Christ is the light of the world you're made out of light your spirit man is made out of light man created to live in a spiritual world the water is light the crystal sea is made out of light your mansions are made out of light your steak your salmon whatever it is you like to eat barbecue you know if you like Asian food they have all kinds of food everything you like and love is there I like the desserts I want my mansion felwood deserves their cakes are this big around and this high one cake and you slice this piece of chocolate cake it's this big here's a piece of cake you can actually eat the whole thing you eat it you leave it sitting there no there's no guilt no one's guilty in heaven you go on a tour of heaven and leave that cake sitting right there when you come back eventually there's a whole cake there the missing piece was replaced your cake never runs out or your apple pie whatever it is that you like it won't run out amen and this is the best part I actually was invited by the Lord to go to someone's home that was living in heaven they didn't see me nobody in heaven sees me when he takes me there he hides me in heaven because if he did not they know what I do down here they know I go there and come back here they would be chasing me down the streets of gold handing me pictures of their family members with their names written on it their addresses because they know where you live and their phone numbers and they would say please go tell them I love them I'm making plans for them I'm so excited for what they're doing today I can't wait to see them again that's what they say they get a little singing a pom quarter I don't know what you call it and every time I see a place you would like they put it in this when you come up in heaven they'll hit it here comes this list and then want to take you to every one of those places and taste all these different foods from different bakeries different restaurants I was invited to this place and I saw this dining room in a mansion would see 100 people and all the tables were set like a king's banquet and all the family members and friends and the prophets and the Apostles all came we're coming to eat at this person's home and everyone sat down and they still think God for the food isn't that awesome and then they said what they want it appeared on everybody's plates to perfection Meiji perfection the best tasting none of it was ever left on anybody when you ate it and we're done it all disappeared off the plates nobody cleaned it up there is no garbage in heaven there's no waste in heaven say that's heaven that's where I'm gonna live one day don't worry about your little grandma she's not up there scrubbing dishes for a hundred people but I know some grandmas that love to entertain and actually cook cooking is our gift they will have a fully supplied kitchen three times bigger than this room is their kitchen and there'll be appliances and weird things there that we never had in the search that they use to prepare all the food and what they're given is not like real animals that died it looks like it because it's made out of light they put in their order the angels deliver the food and the groceries whatever they need vegetables doesn't matter what it is side dishes the entrees the desserts but this grandma that was a grandma that now looks 25 is going to cook for all 100 people and she I saw her I saw her in her kitchen she's gonna make salad and they had salad bowls like this she was slicing cucumbers as she sliced a cucumber and the peel came off it disappeared there was no trash whatever she peeled off it disappeared and she was just singing and so happy some new family members they come in to heaven and she was throwing a party for them that's what she was doing so there was no waste there was no garbage but what was left was the best meal they ever had so that's like what happens when you go to visit someone in heaven and that awesome it is worth everything you live in the manifest presence of God his presence is in your furniture piss in your floor's it's in the walls even the walls of your home will worship God the streets of gold worship Him every pebble in heaven has a face and they worship God the flowers sing the trees sing is a powerful beautiful place to live and they are watching our lines now they don't see a lot of the tragedies that happened and they don't see every sin that somebody committed because it's time to celebrate but they know what God's plans are for you and they would declare over you every day amen if you were angry please please hear this if you had a fight with them and then they died and you didn't get to say you were sorry they already forgave you and if you mention it to them they won't remember it when you get there they'll be so happy to see you if it makes you feel better just look up and say I'm so sorry Bob that fighting out there they're gonna go what was that I don't remember that they'll remember every good and happy thing that you did every gift you gave them every time you kiss them every time you hugged them they love you more now than they did when they were here because now they're filled with that love this is how while the love of God is there can be somebody who killed somebody and that person went to prison and that person in heaven will pray all the time God's let them know you I forgive them I want them to know you they need to know you and they will pray over that person all the time to know the Lord send someone to talk to them let your spirit go consume them but let them know you that's how much they love him that person gets saved in prison they go home to heaven they are best friends best friends best friends that's how far-reaching the love of God is that's why he wants us to live the way I've been talking to you about our life is a witness it's a testimony of who we are of who he is and you need to know all this because one of the most powerful things we do so there's a protocol in heaven if you want to live on earth like they do in heaven every morning when you get up before you get out of pad this works I get more emails about this one simple thing that anything else God has me teach people it's the scripture about the throne of grace you yourself every day of your life can be filled with fuel from heaven that will be poured into your being that will make you feel different act different think different and you won't show up at your friend's house heaven well it's real simple the Bible says that the father filled his own son with that grace he didn't have to fill a son with eternal grace but he had to have grace for abundant life because then he could tell people I come to bring a life and life more abundantly you know what abundant life is it's being free from all kinds of things that come you face every day everyday normal things you go to work people are egging where you're getting blamed for something you didn't finish something you're getting blasted by somebody or ridiculed by somebody if you are filled with that grace from heaven it won't even touch you it won't it's hard to even be afraid or get afraid because fear can't penetrate it it's heaven in you by simply saying every morning I asked for father because remember we're talking about his throne father everybody say it father say it loud father I asked for and receive grace for this day amen and right now in my being I feel it being porn in it feels like light electricity I literally feel if I said or five times a day I would feel it coming in its fuel and it only comes from one place heaven how simple is that it did not cost you a dime nothing it cost you nothing it is free ask for it you have not this is one major thing to living on earth as they do in heaven because they're filled with that all the time they walk in it all the time there's nobody nobody gets angry in heaven no one's fearful nobody has regrets nobody's condemned nobody is rejected there's no room for it because they are filled with heaven you can have that on earth as it is in heaven that is the number one thing you learn about living on earth like they live in heaven I had to do all these I do every one of them the second one was loosening stuff from your soul it's called a soul checkup and I don't do it every now and then I probably do it 15 times a day because of who I am and what I'm confronted with I don't keep anything inside of me that people say in emails and comments on the phone in person through a second or third person I don't keep it I don't want it I don't have to keep it so as soon as something happens I go I choose to lose all those words unkind harsh negative judgmental words I loose them from my soul right now I will not keep them and I bind to my soul the love and the life of God and then I'm joyful all the time I've already got fuel from heaven now I'm not keeping anything in my soul the keys to the kingdom what you loose on earth will be loosed from and heaven will come and pull it out because Christ is the restorer of our soul if you have cares you cast them on him he comes and pulls them out but it's the keys of the kingdom you bind and you loose I bound the devil for years most intercessors buying the devil all the time you can buy them if you want to buy grab the loose in light of my life I know my family's life I'd rather loose invite in my home and then buying the things of God because what you lose from your soul leaves what you bind in your soul will remain if you want to be happy this is this is real this is real this is how we live on earth as we do in heaven we do these three there's three things it's a protocol first when you get right second one you don't keep anything in your soul you don't want there and the first time you do it every trauma you ever had is gone it can even addictions we've even had witchcraft spirits loose from people's soul when they chose chose to loose it from their soul it's gone like it never happened what you loose on earth is loosed from heaven like it never happened what you bind on earth it will be bound and written down in heaven you can find the life of God the love of God the presence of God the celebration the expectation the creativity is unending and guess what you have it in there and then you will live like that that's what you think on it's what you choose it's what you're going to demonstrate with your emotions if you love joy and happiness and a great future and your gift being used you can bind every one of those to your soul and he was trying to teach us something when he said don't let the Sun go down upon your wrath otherwise it will stay and yourself and you'll get up in the morning and you'll be angry and you'll think about it you talk about how angry are your filling the layers of your soul with anger then you can stay angry then you'll be so angry nobody wants to be around you what is in there is what you will become so don't let it stay you don't have to keep it you don't have to keep depression oppression despair or suicidal thoughts you can loose every one of them from your soul the father spent four earth hours teaching me about the keys to the kingdom he said because you're willing to listen I'm gonna show you who Mel cuz if it is she came your promises because I'm gonna have you trained everybody everywhere you go you're gonna train them how to do a soul checkup it will change the way the body of Christ lives they won't need deliverance they won't need six weeks of counseling because they won't keep anything in them he said and when people who do counseling learn to do this those people won't have to come back for a second visit I have amen I have youth centers youth centers youth and by me to come and train all their workers how to do this and they're crying the entire time they say when you youth come to us it's on drugs and they're in despair it takes it's a year just to get them free we'll do in five minutes they can have the whole year to get stronger and more powerful in God and know who they are without carrying that and that's what's happening these places are getting undone I was shown the future I saw in businesses in churches a little thing on the door that says soul doctor you all need to be so doctors God calls me a soul doctor I saw them even businesses had them because when people get undone or sad or broken you're not a good worker you're actually not good for much of anything you're in a pitiful place I know I worked in a law firm and the ones who did the family law the divorces and all that stuff like that they were always so burdened down because they're carrying all that inside of them they could be free in five minutes free from homosexuality we have a young person in Lamar Missouri just because they lose two from their soul it ran out of them and they have never had any of those feelings emotions again it is powerfullest like you mix the greatest deliverance and intercession that you could possibly do or look for in the earth is available to you personally every intercessory group needs to know about this it changes the way you pray for people how you feel yourself you can't carry those burdens I know someone who was so burdened down with everybody's problems and things you were going through she's a powerful woman of God it aged her so much she went around sad and just broken and I said you cannot live like that anymore God didn't tell you he had to carry those things she loosed him off from her soul and now she has a whole new life it will change the way we live as the body of Christ and the third thing you taught me was how to invite heaven's army to be my weapon and command the army I don't have time to read every scripture that talks about us commanding or being commanders there are many there are many scriptures in the Bible to talk about that I love the one where God said come in-you me that means you're supposed to be a commander that doesn't mean you're gonna tell him what to do that means you're gonna say what will happen people we can't do that what is called those things that be not as though they work we're saying something right there to create something right there you should eat the works of your mouth you know that that's because what you're saying whether good or bad is what you're gonna have we're already using our mouths to create but we need to command command Satan to get out of your face get out of your home to get out of your finances but we're not supposed to fight him our battle is the spiritual battle is that true we do not wrestle against the flesh but we spend so much time fighting each other we don't do anything against the enemy amen it's really simple there's another provision protocol in heaven you have to invite we didn't have Christ until we invited him is that true amen we didn't have Holy Spirit until we invited him during 12 us is that true we were asking so we received the same thing goes for the angelic you have to invite them to be your weapon when the word says that our weapons they are Mahdi it doesn't say it not saying your weapon isn't it it says they who are they who is created informed by God to fight the darkness the army they are our weapons who pull down the strongholds of darkness around us who shred the platforms that demons have been ruling from for years but they were not given permission to just go attack on the road and say they are a military a military needs orders they need the authority of your person giving the orders so who has given authority over the darkness say it loud so we've been given the power say we have a power given to us by Christ that is over all the power of the enemy you can say Christ commanded the host even as a righteous man when he's being judged by the Sanhedrin he said if I wanted to I could call the army of heaven to fight on my behalf he was showing us we had the right to do that so if we have the power over all the part of the enemy which by the way we're not using it or we wouldn't be harmed just to say that in the word I'll give you power over the brother noon you know I know about the stepping on things and all that but at the end of it scripture says and nothing by any means shall harm you Luke 10:19 he wasn't just telling us a nice story he was showing us who we were so if he did this even walking as a man he could come in the hosts are we joint heirs did he say what I did you can do that gives us permission that gives us permission we are not under the Angels we are over them we lived in God we are his offspring they're not his offspring they were all created for a purpose if one third of them were created just to fight the darkness well it's not in heaven no not theirs being threatened but he comes here the enemy to kill steal and destroy that doesn't mean we have to let him we are concerned royalty we have a kingdom that I'm talking about right now living heaven culture is operating in the kingdom the pearl of great price sell all you have just to get that that means give it all up you're flush especially yours you're flush your mind says stop having to justify everything if God's given it to you you just take it and then you do it because having heavens army to command them the number one thing they're going to protect is you and I and my husband will testify have not been attacked by Satan in six years is this true yes it is true because why I use the army and I command that and when you invite them to be your weapon because you have to invite you get 100 members of heavens best assigned to you and they will live in the sky over your home they won't come and fight and go back to heaven they're being assigned to you every King has an army but if that King just sat there even in the natural for King and then after sat there and did nothing with their army they would be run over they'd be robbed from they'd be killed than having stolen from this is this true that's what we've been doing that's why we need revelation revelation changes everything revelation on the Word of God revelation honoring God what who he says we are revelation on what heaven is what the spirit realm is where our rights are what our Authority is where our weapons are that doesn't mean you don't use the blood of Christ the Word of God doesn't mean you're not going to use them but add this weapon to it and this army harkens unto the word of the Lord now I know you think that just means Jesus Christ we are spiritual Lords under the Lord of lords and we are kings spiritual kings under the King of Kings he didn't write down on his side cuz he was talking about King David or Solomon it was us in this time on the earth literally ruling with him we don't have any of that authority without him but he gave it to us you do really simple you choose with your will to invite heaven's army to be your weapon and then you thank God and then 100 members are signed to you immediately and then you learn how to send them an assignment you have to give them orders you couldn't go to our military here and send them some more and not have a written out by someone who has the authority to give the orders and they decide they don't decide I'm going to do this order but not that one they can't do that oh well we're gonna do this but we don't want to do that one we're just gonna do this and go back their butts would be in trouble they would get chewed out they'd have all kinds of things assigned to them that they don't want to do I'm talking about the Earth's military my husband's a Marine once a marine always a marine oh he had training in Parris Island he knows exactly what I'm talking about they can't decide to do things on their own they have to go to the ones who have the authority to give the orders we are the only ones who have authority to give the orders I'm not saying Christ can't be ternoon that forever he is now saying as joint years you're doing this if you want to not be attacked or not harmed or not having stolen from you that army will keep it from happening they can bring back wealth that was kept from you you can send them in all the traffic and they'll do traffic control and you will never have an accident never the only time I've ever was when I forgot or when he forgot never that's part of what they do for you amen and then you have to keep doing it this isn't a one-time thing you do it every day you be strategic make a list you know what where do you send them wherever the army of darkness is doing something especially wherever you go send them before you every day even when you're on vacation when you're going into a meeting to decide if you're gonna get the loan or not send the host in there to give you favor they'll speak to the people like this I like these people I'm just gonna say yes I'm really serious they will give you favor they will open doors for you doesn't this sound like a wonderful plan they will you can send them to your College your students College wreak havoc on health what he'll have a bad day let the professor's be confounded by the words that come out of your child's mouth they'll have to give them favor even if they don't like them even if they don't know them you won't get attacked by people bombarding you with hell when you go in to sign into the lobby if a people used to tell me all the time am I to go to the restaurant and get attacked by people that the clerk doesn't like me that the waitress doesn't like me the hotel clerk just crushed me we'll send the host before you go in there don't ever buy land well setting the host into the deal we're sending you I command you to go in there you find out anything that's not legal that's not right you expose it let me know if it's okay I'm getting that deal that's why they're here who wouldn't want to live like that say in heaven they have no problems they're never turned on or rejected they never have traffic jams everyone chose them favor on earth as it is in heaven and he even made that possible why not 30 years ago because this is the time he chose to call the kingdom age when we would visibly be seen operating in that spiritual Kingdom there proof will be our life how it is live what we are able to have that's the proof it works and I had to live every single bit of this then I'm telling you if you're married this is a free tip please love each other my husband would laugh every time you'd hear me say this and since he knows that he really uses it all the time the Holy Spirit came to me and he said these were lacking anything this is what you do when the love goes out the supply comes in if you're not loving you're not gonna get supply so if you want something love even more I'm talking about between husband and wife you know what I'm talking about say Amen yeah stop making war by fighting and start loving and make warfare there's like three things I have a CD back that are called passionate power it is powerful when you love one another it's almost the highest level of warfare you can make for your children for your marriage for your finances if you're mad at each other loose it from your soul and bind the love of God the passion of God for your spouse to your soul it'll change your marriage in every way all three of these things if you live them as a lifestyle you will never fail the enemy will be terrified at you hell would not want to be around you but the host will love living with you so if you wanted to do that stand up leave without that army and I want to tell you this you can get strategic and make a list and even when the Isis were everywhere my favorite thing to do is I would command my host to go boating on the Strongs the strongholds of Satan commanding the ISIS and fear would fall on them and then I would say go house that the ISIS have a severe crisis and they begin to find weapons abandoned in the desert in the Mideast they didn't know what happened the ISIS would drop their weapons and run because my host went there they pulled down all the demonic controlling them it's always about the spirit of darkness I didn't fight against the flesh I was fighting with the army against the spiritual darkness they pull down the strongholds those those those Isis had no power from Satan because they couldn't hear they were removed fear and confusion falls on them even in games the same thing happens and gangs and Marauders and all kinds of drug lords and human trafficking everyone doing heaven human traffic ministry they need to have an army wherever evil is you can send them but especially around you your household your family your close friends I send them all the time and the Wyss White House I went there in person and I asked for sentinels to be posted all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue all the way through them all through the through the Capitol Hill all the way up to the White House to protect Trump this was before the election and I saw them visibly being posted there to protect and keep him and his family and pens and his family because pence will be our president after Tonks terms two terms are up and they already have the host all around them you can post them places and so there's a protocol wouldn't you invite them so if you want to do that we're going to choose to invite them say I choose with my will to invite the host of heaven to be my mighty weapon I receive them in Jesus name Amen well now you all have 100 members if you're both sided you have 200 if you're children I said it with you we have 10 year olds a command an army from heaven 10 and 8 year olds that command their army is probably into the millions by now because they've been doing it for years they're growing up knowing these truths they lose stuff from their soul they asked for grace every morning they're living already on earth says they live in what are they going to be like when they're 40 relentless against the enemy speaking to the mountains and their cast into the sea that's what they'll be doing and no one can tell them that you can't do that they didn't argue in their mind about it they didn't say oh no that is not scriptural I don't want to write No my pastor doesn't teach that no I'm not going to do that I don't believe that I said you can choose it or you can die because then this time there is great darkness being loosed on the earth great deception great darkness but when you live on earth as they live in heaven it won't touch you so we are now going to send our armies you say Jesus I take power over all the power of the enemy attacking me my family my household my finances my body my destiny I command the hosts of heaven to go right now hold on every stronghold of Darkness shred every platform the enemy's been ruling from for years against me and my family and I command them you trash those demons you bash those demons you throw them in a dry place and have fun doing it go home make toast I can tell you they sing they sing while they do it because they have been waiting for ages to do this oh they whistle they whistle and if I'm really ticked off with the enemy I'll tell them to spit on them and then I'll say tell them I sent you I wanted them to know that I sent them we're supposed to we're supposed to commend we are not under hell's foot hell is our doormat we are not doormats [Applause] when it says turn the other cheek that doesn't mean you stand and let them beat you to the ground that means you decide not to blast them back God didn't ever say to us tolerate sin beating you up I'm talking about humans now he never said that and as a matter of fact in marriage he never told the husband or the wife that you had to tolerate sin in their lives they're running around if they're beating you that is sin he didn't say to submit to their sins if they're doing that it's okay to leave if it's your property tell them to leave I had a face-to-face encounter with Jesus Christ telling me that I was I was married once before a long time ago was a big mistake wasn't God's choice and for six and a half years I was beat up with words and crushed almost to nothing and in this is a believer I was married to and I never asked God so finally he he walks to the wall of my been home and says and I finally said to God what do I do about it and so he walks through the wall he goes now you're asking me you're asking me now because that was not my choice he said so you go break your contract this part really surprised me go break your contract you made with him because the word says what God has joined together let not man put asunder it didn't say anything about one man put together and people are getting married everywhere all day no love there's no love a covenant is between you and God loving one another honoring one another not beating some up like a doormat or you want to take advantage of them or you think they're going to make your life easier that is not a wise thing to do because your life will be miserable it'll be like you're in prison and then it will end up being not good at all no if you didn't know I can hear people's thoughts if you didn't know about that and you have a wonderful marriage of somebody even if they're not a believer then let them remain that's what the word says right it's going to honor God if they're gonna love you if they're going to love you and and you don't have they're not sinning all over the place then they can state God will accept that marriage but for me he had somebody and he said this is what the Lord said to me if you do not break that contract and end that contract and you'll have to go repent to him when you said you loved him you did those marriage vows you didn't mean them you'll have to repent and I did I went to repent you see the blender at me not him do the blender at me and I ended the contract and then I didn't want anybody I didn't want anybody and God said no I have somebody for you and is absolutely necessary for you to marry them if you're going to complete your destiny because with the other one you would have never completed it I could understand why I wasn't doing anything wrong I just didn't ask that's an important thing to know if it's God amen and if you both were not saved at the time you got married God will still honor that but when you know who better and you should have asked so when I met him oh man was he good luck oh he still is we've married 40 years when I met him he didn't know who Moses was he didn't didn't know anything you probably better he didn't have any religious baggage number one that's what God said oh no he'll become a mighty man of God but you are marrying him because you get your place where you let God tell you what to do if you've died then he tells you what to do and if you obey it's gonna be good he said no your marrying him I picked him when you were still in me you have to have him to complete your destiny and you will produce holy seed and I need that holy seed that's what this is this is my conversation with God no you're gonna marry him you will have three daughters and I need that holy seed in the earth so you go tell him yes because he wanted six kids and I had told him no and I went God said go yep she said go do a deal with him he actually did he said he loves you so much and will always love you so you go do a deal with him and you tell him you'll have three [Laughter] doesn't it sound like a divine thing you go tell him you're gonna marry me buddy but you'll only have three and they're gonna be spread apart and and there was one more thing you said to tell him and he'll always buy me disposable diapers because I had changed diapers on twelve of my siblings coming up cloth diapers hanging him on the line in Florida where I got it would rain every 15 minutes they would get mildewed you'd have to take them down like eight clotheslines I'm talking about eight clothes on take them down stick them in a wringer washer and right when they go through the wringer my brothers are still a bug on there I had seven brothers there's almost nothing you can say that it's going to bother me okay and I had seven sisters does a lot of drama he made sure I was dead before I left home so I said yes and we got married and I I was madly in love with him I mean I want to encourage everybody here if you've never married don't marry do not marry somebody you can live with marry someone you cannot live without the more modest air the more love you have each other the greater chance you have of it surviving but now that you know about loosing from your soul if when have you upset each other home in the bathroom and loose it all from your soul you'll come out happy as can be or the garage would be a good place or outside it doesn't matter oh yeah the fishing hole yeah that's his favorite place you know I cannot stand fish if you don't know me I cannot stand I mean I'm I hate lists as Satan and fish Satan and fish and broccolis number three that's it and he gave me a fisherman it's actually his gift you know we have a gift that gift we'll use in heaven whether it's a baker or you're gonna rodeos or a designer the passion the gift he made you and sent you here as you never got to use it the minute you step into heaven your whole mansion is designed around that if you're designed to be a dancer you'll have a hole what do you call that pleasure you go to watch a theater like a big theater as part of your mansion you'll have Studios to teach dance you have theaters to to show the dancers and do the dances if you're a musician the same thing you have a concert hall as part of your mansion every beautiful mansion but your whole property if you're gonna have rodeos you'll have hundreds and thousands of horses that have learned to buck really well or the bowls you will never you will never win with those bowls because they'll be yelling you the whole time you are not staying on me that isn't gonna happen you may have been a champion on earth forget it they'll have a massive range so I'll have the whole thing they'll have the whole ring that you have all these things in that's your passion if you mean the best barbecue in your city you'll have a restaurant and serve the best barbecue in heaven it's what you've always wanted to do it is you well yes is a fisherman oh the hunters oh you can still hunt in heaven but you do it with like a scope it's a camera scope looks like a gun but it's just a camera and the way you capture something is on the image the image if you can see them in the mountain of spices you'll go backpacking up there on your horses the horses are laughing at you the whole time because they know you're never gonna find the creatures that you're hunting and the creatures if they capture you first with the scope you go back to their club and there's a massive screen like 30 feet 30 feet 30 feet and there will be your picture and then the car will be the creature that captured you [Applause] so nobody guys but it becomes very intense extremely and rarely has a human being ever captured these creatures and so they're determined I'm gonna be the first one and they go well I think I got some I'm pretty sure I got some yeah then you show up and there's your picture plastered all over the big train heaven is exciting amen so I hope you've grown and you've learned and you said yes if you do those three things then you will live on earth that's they live in heaven but it is a lifestyle and the more you send the army it doesn't have to be just for you it can be for family members friends missionary groups and if you hear something going on if there's a war in another country you literally can send your army to pull down the darkness controlling that whole army and if you get people to come together we know people who come together once a week and strategically send their armies together it's devastating it's devastating the hell's planes amen the more you sound the more you get they get multiplied like you don't get another hundred if you've been sending them for a whole week you'll get 10,000 then it goes to a million and I've been doing it probably around five years or so I have 33 billion that I send everywhere all the time I do sweeps of host states to expose every every group of human trafficking drug trafficking violence witchcraft whatever it is I send them they do is sweep cuz I'm gonna make Florida a region of light [Applause] Colorado yeah Bessie Denver's ending in the Denver all the time you can even send them into the laws that they're gonna make that you don't want or even after they have been made the hosts can go influence the people who are over those laws or they can expose all the crime that's being done because of those laws and they'll realize we should have never done this you can use it in Congress in your own city government in the state government and I certainly sent them throughout the entire election and the midterm elections end every voting booth to speak to the people in the voting booth they vote for life freedom and justice and they will go and they'll come back quickly so be strategic the more you send the more you get amen and and they know it works and we get things from all over the world the people that are doing this that their lives are never been the same so we're gonna live on Earth as we live in heaven amen so father I bless these people right now and you can you can sit down for a minute we're going to take up an offering if we haven't done it yeah I don't know if you did it before I got here or not okay if you want to be a part of helping to supply heavens plan that's how he has me say it if you want to give to help supply heavens plan for what I'm doing and I go all over the world and I share this to many congregations whole congregations are changing they're learning how to lose stuff from their soul they're learning to ask for grace every day and from the time you ask your life changes if you will ask every morning and we even had these you have a little tent card to say remember to ask for grace I tell people write it on your wall write it on something put it somewhere even if you have to put it in your car and you forgot when you get in your car you ask for that grace I asked for receive grace for this day it's a simple when you get upset or angry especially when you're going into traffic but don't keep anger in you but send the host every time we even send out the mountain to them they had to clear all the roads off all the way from the hotel you were going in and blow on that ice and all that snow and there will be none when we drive up there and they did it they're there to keep you and protect you in all your ways amen so don't forget so if you want to be a part we have a lot of plans that we are doing right now we're adding new products I'm going to be creating new CDs DVDs we're having a lot of that put on mp3 we get that all the time even the books will be downloadable really soon because people in Malaysia pay like 60 or 70 dollars to order one book you don't realize how good you have it here no matter how much we think well things have been raised happy you don't live in a foreign country whereas eight dollars a gallon for gas I know that was ten years ago ten years ago we visited country and it was $8 a gallon yeah we we really have a wonderful country that we live in and I say God Bless America all the time you know god bless it and he will because he loves it he loves every country he loves all the people but those who say yes to him and yes to his will his way those are the ones that he can use to do great things so thank you for giving into the offering oh you've already got her up there there you go and yeah you make if you still have checks my mom does I'm still she's got her a little card and she says I don't know if I want to swipe this or not I went if you want me to pray over it I will mom just so you know it's gonna be okay because if anybody tries to use it you still get that back so you're safer she's 87 well I don't know and then she lost her checks and couldn't find him for a long time so then she started mr. the card I think the angels hid them for my sake because I was all the time going in her room and asking the Holy Spirit okay where are our fruit checks you know where everything that was made that is me that will ever be made you know exactly where this checks out so show me right now and every time I pray that every time he shows me but I don't want to do it every week so thank you for giving I'm gonna just bless the offering father God I thank you for the supply coming in father that when we are faithful to give ourselves and and faithful to help ourselves that we will be abundantly overwhelmingly blessed God and I thank you for multiplying it back to everybody a hundred or a thousand fold return God's and I ask it to be multiplied even in the baskets even when it's in our accounts to let it be multiplied because this is your will it's your way and it's your plan amen and I say yes all the time so thank you for saying yes thank you for blessing and may the host go with you everywhere you go don't forget to send them against darkness every day of your life don't forget to ask for grace and don't keep anything in you that you don't want so let's stand up it'll be the last thing we do we're gonna have a soul checkup right now we're gonna get it done it's like anything else you have to choose with your will to do this and we know people I tried it didn't work I said you didn't really mean it they're wanting to be free from cigarettes and you can be we've had a lot of people be free from that but they still wanted them and they still smoked them and what well you know if you want to give it up you're actually supposed to say no if that comes back to you and the enemy will try you you just say no and so I said well I'm still not sure about that but we've had a lot of people set free from all kinds of things like we talked about including homosexuality which is not of God it's the devil perverting the image of God because we are made in His image everyone in Genesis 1:26 was the everyone God ever made we were made in His image and after his likeness so anything that doesn't line up with that is something that Satan got into he wants to destroy images he wants to destroy destinies and I pray they actually call me they call me and ask me how to be free and they go even though I say this is okay I'm talking about the homosexuals even though I will tell people I love this and I'm doing great they're not they said I suffer inside my soul fights with me all the time I don't know why it fights and when it because God put things in you before he sent you and it's not agreeing with what you're choosing and they said well no I mean I really want to go to heaven cuz even though I say this is OK inside I know it's not OK so no matter what they say they know deep inside it's not it's not right and so I just take him through the word about showing them about the image of God and and how he lived in God and what his plans are for us and they get saved they pray and they get saved and then they loosen because then it never they don't feel like that anymore amen so we're gonna choose to lose all kinds of things from our soul and then when we're done with that we will bind the things of God to our soul and you can say you had a soul checkup but you can actually teach other people how to do soul checkups especially people you know that are broken are really sad they're in fear they need to loose that from their self almost everything being displayed from people 99percent of the time it is what is in their soul as you think it's in your soul so are you so people are angry all the time or they're in fear they feel unworthy unworthiness you know they could have a spirit of infirmity you can even lose them from your soul and they'll be gone so we're gonna say I choose as an act to my will and a child of God I lose for my soul all fear all anger all unworthiness all oppression depression despair and grease and hate every harsh critical mean spiteful judgmental word spoken to me or that I spoke I lose it from my soul I lose from myself Oh Oh poverty all wrong handling of money I lose it from my soul I lose from my soul all strife all violence all acts of violence any violence done to me any violence I saw Oh drama of any kind no matter how long ago I lose all abuse from my soul I loose from myself all addictions whether drugs pornography abuse hate food any sickness disease spirit of infirmity I loose it from my soul and he curses spoken over me and he lies told about me I lose our rejection I loose all of I lose all I'm time north of hers now yeah I lose all abandonment I lose all harm or fear of harm I lose all confusion of any kind I lose every word sounds image frequency thought movie or action that represents hell I loose it from my soul in Jesus name Amen I forgot something you can say that yourself you can say it yourself if I didn't mention something say it yourself you can do it all day every day and now we're gonna bind things of God I choose with my will to bind to my soul these are gonna come in waves the love of God the life of God the presence of God the celebration of God the will of God the joy of the Lord his creation his expectation his goodness I bind those things to my soul I bind his welt i bind divine help i bind prosperity I bind his power to my soul yeah I bind his laughter I bind his dance I find his song I bind them to my soul so my soul now prospers amen Hey I am happy I am happy you are so full of God right now if you did that every day of your life what would happen you would be walking on air that's when the greater works if you weren't here the other day I talked about how that actually just happened to me in Reno of all places and Reno I just stepped off of the stuff and didn't realize it and I literally walk down there about this far off the ground my sisters like freaking out behind me no Mike I'm what I'm like I look Turnham like I was standing on air and so I say to the father Wow father is that as good as walking on water and he goes no it's a greater work water you can feel the air you can't feel he said you better get used to that because you'll be doing it it's a manifested daughter of God amen if you see the rainbow coming out of your head that's the image of God if your eyes become flames of fire that's the Lord's image and the father's image if you have gemstones appear on your skin which might sound weird you but everybody in heaven wears them on them they come from the Father they come from his heart he has them all so it's one of his images gemstones in heaven are so extremely valuable because they all come from the heart of God they're put on your robes of righteousness there in your walkways up to you of your home I was in someone's home and I saw massive gemstones which was what they were they had on the on their table as decorations decor for this table that probably seated like I don't know I've been in homes a hundred people the dining room I'm talking about in someone's home but I've been in one even bigger than that this one had about baby 460 people and the drapes on the windows were so sheer they were moving they were living and they had pearls this big on the end of all the drapes their chandelier was 50 feet long in their dining room and it was real gemstones all from the heart of God and their glory was reflected because all over the ground reflects the glory the sky has the glory the buildings are filled with the glory of God if you walk and live in the glory of God you live you live in the glory down here we are practicing because up there it will be your life you come in your mansion and the mansion will speak to you and say welcome home even your mansion knows you knows your name the disciples will come and greet you they'll come and move in for a while King David will come and take you in his own chariot across the skies of heaven on a tour of heaven you go see Paul who sits in this garden all the time and all you're talking about is the epistles but when he gives the epistles he's given what happened in the spirit realm your HOH testimony changes because you get to go in your own little theater you see your life relived with you angelic around you what was going on with Holy Spirit around you you see the whole spirit realm exposed in your life from the time you're growing up and your whole testimony chi changes it changes you'll change there's no sin in any of these videos you'll invite all your friends and family to come and watch your life and they'll laugh a lot because what they did keep recorded was all the silly funny things you did especially when you were teenagers and your parents will be there laughing they'll look the same age as you but then you will go to theirs and you can see all the silly crazy things they did that they wouldn't want anyone to know about and people will go in they laugh and laugh and yes you cry in heaven he wipes away the tears at the end of the Bible when the former things will be remembered no more you laugh let you laugh and cry from joy you laugh and cry because you're so undone about the love of God His goodness the beautiful amazing things he gave you what happens all over heaven you have excitement you have adventure you have joy joy joy you create and invent amazing things everyone in heaven loves you everything in heaven loves you when people go it's heaven on earth they must be living heaven culture amen so thank you for letting me share and then may heaven they heaven invasion will create a habitation for heaven in your home and they will come and not leave and made the hosts go with you [Applause]

[Music] everyone this is my husband captain me first time he's been here I'm excited man can you hear me [Music] make sure this is on it's on now I just had to push that back nine okay we're on well the time of my message tonight is time for freedom if you wonder why all the time a lot of confirmations on that from God he said it's time for freedom so that's the title of the message for us to operate your freedom in our own personal lives and our country especially in America it is time for freedom for the body of Christ it is time for freedom it's the time to rule and freedom amen because we all know that the truth will make us [Music] free indeed and that's really what time it is in our lives and especially all those who came here tonight you will leave with a deposit of heavens freedom in you amen and my notebook is blank it's here to hang on to I guess I tell people if you're gonna talk about having an you've been there you don't need notes because you will never forget it never if you had a dream so vivid ten years later you remember if it was in heaven then you probably were there a lot of people don't know you're taking even in your sleep your spirit man can be taken in your sleep and that dream is so vivid you recount everything about it what it felt like the music the aromas the experience of just touching heavens ground being in the throne room a lot of places in heaven and heaven is coming and invading this earth you know the body will pick up and hear something from heaven and they'll say that for years and then it actually happens and so this is the time for it to happen heaven is converging with this earth that means a lot will change in our lives that means we need to start living on earth like they live in heaven that's called heaven culture heaven has their own culture trust me every when you move there they know that their life is radically different and their existing to live down here we have to kind of exist sometimes except in this time we actually can live in the past you know you have to take have a living in your life in order to exist you had to make a living right but in this time it's time to exist to live if we can live on this earth like they do in heaven and heaven is invading this earth and are all of our senses are being brought alive moving into manifest and I'm sitting there and God says there'll be manifestation and demonstration there'll be signs and wonders you know there's all kinds of things that they're saying about this time on the earth and we should all be able to experience them and actually help make them happen you know when Christ was here he was a living example for the disciples he was training them the whole time he walked in his life those last three years of his life everything you did or said that was training for the disciples well I come to Train I'm not here to give you a nice word I'm not here to give a nice message that might tickle you a little bit I'm here to change you to Revelation manifestation demonstration signs and wonders and I know some of that will come from heaven itself but really it's because heaven is invading us it's us we it is our turn right now to manifest for heaven in this earth you know we're putting on the show say we're putting on a show and the show has begun we are the third show the first one was the father the second one was Christ in hell on the third day well we are the third show being put on in this earth amen he's going to show up and show off in us that is a show so if you had if you had a lot of showman in you you're ready you are so ready a lot of the body has to be transitioned into being a very open person expressive person doesn't matter what anyone says or you know sees about them God isn't hiding us anymore he's not hiding us time for the body of Christ to come out of the closet and let the world see us operating on the stoats just like they do in heaven we're supposed to manifest the image of the Living God and if you're ready for that you should be saying to the father I want to look like you and act like you and singing to his son I want to look like you and act like you and even the Holy Spirit I want to look like you and act like you we will fulfill Genesis 1:26 what God said let us make man in our image there you go look like them and operate like them their likeness is how they operate that's revelation on that scripture people think why are they saying the same thing twice they're not when you begin to understand heavens language they can say something to something similar to the next word but those are always going to be two different things their image and their likeness are two different things their likeness is literally how they operate so worse was the operating on this earth on this earth like they are in heaven that means you may have a manifestation manifestation is something supernatural that people haven't seen before coming from you I have already had four manifestations knew never done before coming from me as demonstration of the Living God just because I started telling him I want to look just like you so they've seen the rainbow moving in and out of my head say God as the father's image isn't it they've seen that they've seen my eyes become flames of fire amen like my pupils are flames of fire and this was just in the last few months this has started happening and the third thing is that I was just in my products table like saying hi to people and the father had warned me at any time because they gave permission I want you all to say this I give permission anytime anywhere you want to you may demonstrate through me and I yes you need to mean that when you say that father anytime anywhere you choose I give you permission to demonstrate through me who you are and Jesus Christ I give you permission Holy Spirit I give you permission to demonstrate and manifest through me your image and the way you operate so be it I receive it amen I'm gonna take a minute and remind you of some of the things some of the images that Christ took on this earth his eyes were flames of fire he walked on water he made food created food amen he traveled in the spirit realm and controlled time because it's Ellery them they stepped in the boat they were there that's one of the things that he did is one of the ways he operated he raised the dead even after they were stinking he terrified the demonic all the time amen he walked on water are you willing to do that the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit one of his images is littered becoming a flame of fire it was a flame of fire that couldn't be quenched couldn't put out he showed up in the upper room and boy did he have drama drama comes with him he is called the drama king in heaven just wait and see what's going to happen he was invisible everybody say one of the ways he operated yet he had many things that represented him in his image that he used in this earth a man and the father the living rainbow moving in and out of him it's not just a rainbow it's alive moves in and out like this in waves all the time in heaven in and out of him that's who John saw in the book of Revelation in chapter 4 he saw him sitting on the throne with a rainbow like unto an emerald you notice he didn't say just like an emerald because he didn't have a word for teal teal is the father's favorite color and those bands coming out of him can be like that can be one full band that goes from him to the walls of the throne room it could be like red or blue or blue green teal it could be purple it can be blue and a red mixed together whenever those rainbow that rainbow comes out of him when you're in the throne room you could have been there seven different times and that rainbow was a different color every time everyone in this in the throne room would turn that color it would saturate them and turn them that color say that's the father's image there are cosmic waves I call cosmic waves like I think to me the biggest greatest thing is like cosmic it's bigger than all the cosmos out there he has waves to come through from him love I'm telling you the greatest love come from him and then the glory when the glory comes you hear it has a frequency the love and and the glory of God and the peace of God they have a frequency that comes with him and I've been in there before one like this wave like continue like a shock wave would come from him and it would go like mmm mmm I can't even make the sound it was so loud and it would penetrate everybody in there all the way around him and they would get they would get thrown to the floor that's that's one of the ways he operates it is he also has flames of fire his flames the fire are blue his pupils are literally flames of fire and the glory comes something so great if you stand in front of him long enough you'll see these flames of fire that are his eyes it's one of his images so all these amazing images are these images in the way they operate from the father from his son from the holy spirit he is a whirlwind I've seen him come in many times as a whirlwind sometimes he was a whirlwind of the rainbow and he come and he he would be like you know kind of invisible but he's actually big he's actually got a body arms legs a head or you wouldn't have one they all do the Father the Son Holy Spirit all have an actual body because we're made in there or you wouldn't have on those images are manifested in different ways and of course the Holy Spirit also in the image of a dove that was not just a little dove with feathers that Dove had feathers what were made out of flames the fire when he came down and was over Christ when John was going to baptize him remember when he baptized him and that dove came down and then they heard the voice of the Father declaring who his son was and he was pleased in him and so they have a voice there's another thing about their voice haven't experienced that yet I've heard it when it talks in the Bible that it was sounded like many thunders or many waters because they didn't have like today's language to interpret that he has his voice is layered there's layers in his voice that's why it sounds like many many thunders or many waters he literally has layers in his voice expect that to happen to you one day when you get up to speak and people are shook they're just shook to the core when the hearing speaking is like layered like many saying it instead of one this is his this is one of the images this is this is one of the images that they and the likeness that they operate in so if we're supposed to be just like them you better be ready for any of these things to manifest to you okay just the works of Christ was shocking to people but the greater works then he is reserved for this time there's time again this is a different time if you've never heard that said you're not living in the same spiritual time that we did even a few years ago because I've been talking about this for a lot of years a lot of many years I've been talking about all this happening and you know but God has on this timeline a time when that starts and we're not waiting on that time anymore we are in that time we're in that time where we will stand out and stand up and show off you can you stayed up and you can you know you need to wake up and stand up and that's nice but standing out and showing off is a whole different thing that's when you can't hide and you'll never be able to hide again because God has marked you for greatness if you're alive in this time even those who don't know him you know some of them are marked for greatness and so we need to believe and have faith and hope for everybody no matter how wicked they are God right now in this time is moving on the hearts of very wicked people he really is and you may not see Christ coming from them at the time but you'll see a major change in the way that they talk and they live like the North Korean president if people don't realize there is a major change in that man that didn't just happen for any reason that was God's plan he had a plan I'll either change him or remove him off the face of the earth and many leaders and countries right now are in that place because God is trying to align as many countries as he can to agree with his plan and those countries will prosper beyond measure because they've heard him and they are shifting God is right now shifting she's shifting governments to shape that nation Korea is going to be shaped by God by God as America is right now we're being shifted right now do you haven't noticed in the shifting process all of Hell will be exposed people no matter how high up the ladder they have gotten if they're a wicked if they have a wicked agenda and they've been hiding it it will be exposed and those who are in leadership or in our government or even in big business this includes big business - it even includes the church those who are hiding lying sinning and thinking that they could stand here and give the Word of God and speak on his behalf if they think they can do that anymore not in this time they will not and the Spirit of God is really moving on the hearts of those that are doing it so they don't die I'm just as serious about that is all the rest because there this is a time that's so important to God that he's removing all the roadblocks he's removing all of the weights anything that has held us back to be able to prosper to have a voice to have a platform everywhere to speak on his behalf whether is the business arena the governmental arena arts and entertainment arena news and media arena he's moving on the hearts of people and he is shifting even in those different arenas you're gonna see major changes in all of those arenas when God's gonna do something new he always sends a a messenger or messengers and they have revelation in them the messenger if it's about heaven or time or God they have to have revelation in them that's not something that came from their own mind never in my life did I set a time thinking I was gonna do any of this I had my plan me Father Son and Holy Spirit and a nice little you know executive apartment somewhere moving and shaking the business world that was my plan so what does he do remove me totally completely out of the business world well that took that off his plan off my plan my plan that was gone it was just gonna be me did you get that me not a husband not children me father said in Holy Spirit well that was wiped off you know that was quite tough of my plan I obviously got married I I have three beautiful children that God said they were holy seed and he informed me because a long time ago I gave him my life he informed me you are marrying him he did not ask me when you get the place what God is telling you that is significant because you're not going to fight against your gonna say okay yeah I gave you a permission which you did tonight and he started a 40-year plan on me to prepare me for what he was gonna do with me he even took me out of my wonderful job I had there was high paying and I loved it so I thought well you know I'm married but I can still work in the business world and I loved it I've worked over 25 years in the business world well he wiped that off from my plan by getting me fired he's gonna make sure I left but he was kind enough to tell me 30 days before it happened in 30 days you will not be working there anymore I was working in a law at a nice job with a Christian lawyer which was a miracle Oh a Christian comedian lawyer which was a double miracle so I had a lot of fun I love my job enjoyed it didn't know a thing about law but was trained in business law estate and probate and tax law and real estate which I didn't know a thing about it and he still hired me that's called favor that's also called God's plan so he really did he got me and shifted me everywhere and then I had my three daughters that was a big surprise but he also told me that you're gonna marry him you'll have a three girls and I need them all so you will say yes to him because I would say nope see one at six and I am one of 15 at the not the very top if you've never been part of a big family especially one of the older ones you don't know what dying is you die every day so I hope to raise 12 of my siblings and now he's telling me remember my plan no husband no children just the Trinity and me doing big business together and he informed me each of these times because from the time I was young I could hear him well but the more I gave myself to him and the more I chose his will his way and obey I will tell you right now a very important keys right his will his way not yours a lot of people on his will they do it their way it takes longer it'll slow things down you may have to start all over again sometimes so I decided I'm doing it I'm gonna have I want your will your way and then I had to obey even when it didn't make sense and I promise you he is almost never going to make sense one of my friends recently made a statement she she preaches a lot her family have like seven churches everywhere and she's blocked so she's got a lot of layers in her soul she's extremely expressed that she's a lot of fun but she will tell you the way it is let me tell you she said God always ask you to do things crazy things he lets you do crazy things that don't make any sense to you but yes for the crazy things so that it can bring the supernatural what usually doesn't make any sense either and I promise you she was right on when she said that it's almost always crazy doesn't make any sense because he is not a man he has his own plan right so here is after saying all that in all these years he then began to tell me okay right now you're marrying him you're gonna have three girls you can have them five years apart if you want to but you're gonna have them and then as a baby he showed me the destiny of each one of them I saw what they would be doing I know what they'll be doing for a very long time in their in their life need some water I'll talk to nothing comes out I don't want to waste time so Jesus as one of the way he operates he wasn't that bombed by time even as a righteous man and I like to remind everybody yes he was the son of God but he walked and lived as a righteous man just like you he had to face everything you faced he had to make decisions how he was gonna respond react what he was gonna allow in his soul but he wouldn't allow in his soul that he would love instead of hate he didn't sin he didn't sin he said no to sin he had absolute authority and power over all the power of the enemy that's why he could give it to us he would command the heavens to open did you hear me say the word command say a righteous man commanded the heavens to open and he did that more than once are we righteous can we command did he command the hosts of heaven that's another way he operated the hosts of heaven are the armies of heaven and he even said when he was on trial if I wanted to I could call the army of heaven to come and fight on my behalf did he say that say as a righteous man he said that he commanded when he was on this earth he commanded the water to turn into wine and that was not normal wine he commanded the water to turn into heavens wine when that be great for some people he did that all the time because it reminded him of home heavens wine is the best wine and that's why they said at the wedding you have saved the best for last never have we ever had wine like this before never yeah because it didn't come from Earth it came from heaven and have news for you Jesus did that at home all the time that's why Mary knew he could do it right she knew that he could turn that water into heavens wine he did it when he was growing up nobody was ever sick in his home while he was there the food would all be always be multiplied on the table he already operated in these things and he knew one day he would step out and do them remember what Mary said go do whatever he says to do and Jesus said are you making me step up before my time no Mary knew it was time and when they came for him remember when he's preaching somewhere and they said your mother and your siblings are outside asking for you they were not asking him to come home and preach say Amen or he would have been they would have already been in the meetings they missed heavens wine they missed the food be multiplied they missed never been sick because of his presence these are things he had to learn and grow when he grew up in these but there came a time in his life when he knew exactly who he was he knew his purpose from the earth he had to say yes like we had to say yes he had to choose to do these things you have to choose to be chosen many are called but few are chosen because they don't say yes to being chosen that's why I always say say I'll receive it because when you say I received it that means you're saying yes I want to be chosen I had to choose even though he was telling me what to do I still had to choose to do I had to obey and the Bible says those who are willing and she'll eat the fatter the it's a promise in this time it's really important to make sure that you obey even if it doesn't make sense and so I told you there were four things he started manifesting in me the fourth thing the fourth thing happened last weekend when I was in Reno Reno Nevada I walked on air remember how they operate Jesus walked on water I walked on the air and I was quite shocked and my sister was behind me we were going to the greenroom the pastor was in front of me to head into the green room and I didn't know that there was a drop a step this big come to in something there's a big step and then you've stepped down I didn't see the step I just was going because he was beacon to me as he was going forward I'm speaking to him while he's walking we're both talking to each other and I stepped off to step into nothing and it felt like nothing if you stepped in water you would at least feel the water so I stepped off and I kept going and then I stepped off with my other foot and I'm there and I'm your sister like gas behind me and and now we're so shocked when I look down on this far off the floor in the air this is what is going to happen to you and if you remember even as even at the very end of G's Minh when everything was done and he was going to go home remember he just went up in the air Jesus just went up in the air didn't he say he walked down there right before mine home so I'm just standing there and I'm I said to the father this is Myall and when is this sort of I actually in my mind was speaking him and he was answering me my mind and went is this like walking on water he goes oh no this is better he said when Peter stepped out of the boat he could feel the water you aren't feeling anything and he said by the way you better get used to this like whatever you want and so my sister's like yeah I'm standing on the urine aperture on look at her wonder Stan yeah yeah in her face is like and I actually dropped my iPad I was so so startled and at this point the passage around he goes what's going on and the mini said that my feet just on the floor and I'm like that didn't bother me at all and Django you know said why don't you just say I was walking on it that sounds a little bit better than flow I guess it always both okay that was say a manifestation of the power of God so all for these things that have just started happening is because I gave him permission I gave him permission now he didn't warn me and say oh in the minute you're gonna just step on you're gonna walk on there he didn't warn me about any of these he didn't say oh by the way rainbow is gonna start coming out of your head moving in and out of your head and and I've actually had a few people together that saw another person he was visiting and they were just talking to me and I'm in the middle of this kitchen and they keep going like this like the tryna mommy and I'm like what's wrong he goes you have a rainbow that's like coming in and out of your hat she tried to look to see if it was the lights or was 7 reflecting and I'm he goes no it's the rainbow about an hour later he goes there's that rainbow again I just totally ignored I ignored him you know I thought well I don't know what he ate for dinner but maybe he's tired and then the next weekend I went to a church and was speaking and one thing God the Father told me personally Jesus and the father both told me that at one point everybody in the meeting would see the angels that are with me because we're going to see heaven say we're going to see heaven lots of heaven you come in one day and see all the angels waiting you see yours that came with you okay and if any I'm coming to do something for heaven Oh God then you'll see them too in your mind you have to stop thinking that you're normal we are not like all the people on the earth don't have Jesus their DNA has not been changed but yours has and the other thing too you better get ready for as you actually do have power yourself people oh that sounds just too oh no you have power yet power because Jesus said we did he actually gave it to us all these are in the Word of God okay you just maybe didn't know that you were born in the right time the time that you're born in is very strategic for God and he will wait to a certain event happens when an event happens a fullness of time has come and when a bonus of timing has come that means things will be different in the earth that's also scriptural a fullness of time has come that means the old stuff isn't going to be like totally gone away but the way we operate will be greater and more powerful than the way we used to operate in the old time and when when John the Baptist made that announcement that certainly a fullness of time had come amen upon the time came when Christ was born in the earth another fullness of time came when he was going to step up into his ministry was crucified on the cross that was another time because things would change things change when Christ was born and things changed when he stepped into his ministry and things changed when he was crucified on the cross and was rose from the dead major changes were made this is the time this is the time for the body the manifested say manifested sons and daughters to stand up and manifest in this earth say the earth is crying out and it's shaking in travail for us to stand up and speak to the earth speak to the air speak to the hosts for the impossible to happen amen the earth is not shaking because it is the end and everything is going to be all over the people who don't know God's timing say it is and all the people in the church who don't know this is sitting on the rapture rugs because they want to escape because it's so awful well they will be sitting there forever these are some of the greatest times on the earth that God has written down and he's not going to ignore them but he expects us to participate not escape participate don't escape there's another t-shirt and so many of the body think is so horrible and awful they can't even when you get stuck in that place you can't see the good that is happening you have filled your soul your own soul with doom and gloom wrath and destruction and you can't even see or understand this is the day of his power not the day of his wrath those are two different times we're in the last days because we're a lot closer than we were thousands of years ago we're in the last days but not the last day and major things will happen a lot of things have to happen before the end of time comes many many many things we'll be seeing it doing it experiencing it but we aren't going to escape it you either you either feel it and watch it and sit on the sidelines or you'll be in it I'm going to be in it amen so America right now is in it America hasn't been brushed to the side by god it's a baby nation it's one of the it's one of the youngest nations in the earth I mean there's I've recently visited nations that were thousands of years old I've been to them recently and I come back here and there's no place like here maybe Israel Israel was powerful is a beautiful place filled with the Spirit of God millions of angels are in Israel they still stand in the place where Christ knelt in the garden had to drink that cup they're still in the upper room and I already seen the fiery open we're opening in the upper room where the Holy Spirit came in and anointed all them and the Holy Ghost they're still there they're there even over Paul's where he was held in prison is an open stairway from heaven he created an open heaven in the prison it's powerful to see the things that remain that we're done by those in the past that love God obey God and we're going to make a lot of those places right now in this earth amen so this is this is the time to walk in liberty freedom right and justice and I recently in Reno we all know that Kavanaugh I'm very political right now I'm doing heavens politics executing God God's government on the earth so if we have a government on the earth from heaven that we have to execute for him that's politics so you're not going to escape politics don't ignore it make sure you vote for justice and righteousness right and life and God needs this nation free of the devil which means it's gonna be good for everybody here God is not gonna be a parser to who's living here they will enjoy all the Freedom and the Liberty to prosper you know to live in health to have new creations and inventions never seen before in this country they'll enjoy all the stuff that will be created in these 24 years of God in the White House you've never heard that that is not news to me and God has hand-picked the person he wants there and there's no human being on this earth there's nothing in the Earth's over there's nothing that can take those people from that white house [Applause] amen hey man I hope everybody's happy about that that God would pick remember he's strange he doesn't think like a man he picked the most on likely never in the history of our country has one man caused such an uproar never in the history of our nation or even in this world except Christ because Christ caused the greatest uproar and his time he was not liked by the hierarchy he was hated by the ruling powers and the devil especially despised him and tried every way he could to get him out of the picture just have something here you never hear any of this coming against someone who isn't gonna do good did you notice that the ones you don't care about the country don't even know what they're doing that might not have been their plan but they just weren't the right person amen and that means in any country it says when when the righteous are in leadership when they're in charge the people will they will rejoice and God does love everybody but just like he chose John the Baptist for something Moses or something Abraham for something Jacob Isaac it didn't go all the way down the line David Solomon he hand-picked them before they were here he still does that and it's usually if you look at King David he smelled like the Sheep he danced and sang in the meadows you would not have picked him to be king even the Prophet was amazed the ones who look tough strong handsome those were the ones he wanted to and God said no no no no yeah and what about Gideon he here all the time from God he actually told God no no no no no I must have the wrong person nope I'm not doing this no no that is not me I am NOT doing it but God kicked him did he do it you have to be the same way because you know what I wouldn't pick me and apparently neither would a lot of pastors they don't know what they're missing for one reason they don't like the pink here this is the absolute truth yeah God would not do that that's our answer when you know I love you but you don't know him you might put color on your hair in the middle of the night as you're walking across a platform to speak turn it green then they run wait for it [Applause] one change something so insignificant because image is important your image inside is always more important than that outside and the thing is I've known a lot of these pastors for 40 years helped in all their projects my dad that we would my family go help in all their projects to help the poor the sick paint their churches up to bring them food and they were blessed beyond measure about how godly and awesome we were until I fell off the deep man and put pink in my hair you choose they choose a man I will tell you this their wives coming to my meetings and the other thing they say is well I love what you do but our congregation is not ready and when will I see them at the meetings they show up I've got a pastor something those church I'm so glad and love with Revelation so you have to choose through your whole life you have to choose things and I am glad he chose me and I actually like the pink hair now it's not going away because in this time we're gonna be strange just like him we will be different speak different live differently and it will cause people to come and ask you why amen I need a tissue oh yeah if I if I if I cry during the worship it's gonna be over any man yeah Jesus makes me cry a lot the love he has for us and he he looks beyond our mistakes and the thing is people wanted to throw mistakes in with sin and they'll tell you have to repent you may have made a mistake but you apologize for mistakes you don't repent for mistakes you repent for sin I'm having to teach that to some people there's a difference Amen I mean you know I've had people say all kinds of things like well you lied because you said you would come by and you didn't I said that's I forgot that's not lying lying is saying something that's not the true and so they're gonna get a lesson if they say things like that to me and what no I love you very much but you know when you've got 15 phone calls and people showing up you gotta make decisions for things around the world you probably forget some time I said but that's not lying okay so I apologized so don't let people make you feel like you have sinned because you made a mistake amen okay making mistakes in this world is gonna happen sometime right if I got to send a letter to somebody you know the simplest things but most people who bash you by the way they don't have a vision of their own the father showed me this a long time a lot of the bastards out there that bash you online or whatever they don't have their own vision so people who do they will bash you this is truth that's why they can get so mean they have nothing in their own life just keeping them focused and their going forward something they have nothing to do and they don't want to do anything they look around to see who they can pick on let them go just let it go and you keep running your race amen because you know the enemy will try anything you can to get you sad offended wounded fearful that will crush you keep you back take you off the track and so if you can't get you to abandon Christ or just say I'm giving up completely he'll do whatever he can to delay you or distract you so don't let it happen just say well I'm not gonna let that it's not touching me I'm not letting it penetrate me you notice Christ walks like that in this earth amen so in this time we will do things to manifest them and demonstrate for them and it won't necessarily be in a small crowd so get ready to go to Walmart and you're walking in the air while you're pushing your cart down here down the aisle you know how if you're walking your the carts down here see how many people come to you say what is up with you I am manifesting the Living God that sound exciting he's given us a whole new way and new weapons and demonstrating and manifesting is one of those weapons because you are terrifying the enemy every time you do something like that he'll is afraid right now and they and you know what they're not really good at hiding that whatever rises up and they're afraid but they will bash it bash it lies you know and misjudgment and everything fails they'll do it on purpose to make people think that person is nothing they're not worth something they have no value whatsoever or they're not living the right kind of line and they're not going to jack the wicked any men but hell hell is going to find out that heaven is going to expose a lot of that amen so we'll know who carries truth who lives the truth so we can trust them amen is a powerful time time for freedom everybody say time for freedom that means your lies you'd be different your children will be raised differently in this time we have the right and the freedom to command heavens army to push back the darkness and crush their plans right to raise the dead that we're cremated stop earthquakes and make it go back the way it was before it happened oh stop the storms and not just the Hurricanes and you know that has been so powerful to work with people over the last several months God started the weather warriors I didn't and he put one more thing on my plate get down there and tell people how to take authority over those storms in this time in the earth you're not supposed to have destructive weather say I receive it Jesus didn't tolerate the storm and that was not the only one he stopped it wasn't the only one he stopped you do realize the Bible is sort of like a basic outline because the Bible says itself if everything in all the works that Christ did were written down the books would go around the world so how much do you not know about he didn't just raise the people from the dead you read about in that Bible it was an example okay well while we raised someone from the dead they were dead for four days Wow way to spend thirty days and you're your family members ashes have been sitting on the Shelf in the closet the mantle and you go oh well we forgot to have their celebration service so you're bringing a little ashes and set it there you better be ready for this one and Jesus says to you and you hear him get everything laying hands on that John come in the ashes come in their life in their spirit to come back into that body and it burst open and there is a whirlwind of ashes right here in wherever they're having the acceleration there's gonna be a celebration and those ashes go out places they stopped and there's the person I tell you they'll be miraculous miraculous conversions and salvations in the celebration when they go in Jesus name I command that spirit of the whatever tobe white to come back into his body and that earned burst and that whirlwind of ashes come up say he can put the ashes back together even if they sprinkled him on the ocean he knows where every molecule of our body is and he can bring it all back together say that is a greater work I've seen many of the greater works and their greater or he would not have said they were greater right so you know it be praised against uh they pray against the storms and everything and your prayers probably made a difference but when you command Christ commanded the storm to stop he stopped the winds and he calmed the waves amen so we do greater works so we stop earthquakes who make it put it back say Amen well you believe it or not it's gonna happen this is the thing if he ever wants you to do something like that you will hear him you're not going to sit down and make a list I'm gonna go do this on this day those type of things he will say it to you and you will hear him and he showed me that happening in the earth I was taken forward and I saw what happening I saw a young person in California they've been a massive earthquake buildings crumbled everywhere hundreds of people died in this earthquake and they ran out in the street and they said stop and then they said put it back in Jesus name and the earth began to shift and all the parts of the buildings came up out of the ground and put the building back together the bridges came back together and all the dead were raised and back in the offices or the stores are walking on the street where they were before it happened say greater work we will do them in that powerful Jesus said all the works I did you will do and even greater works you will do we didn't know what the greater works were is those things a plane crashes everybody dies the news media run to record it and show it and the person with the microphones are believer and Jesus says to them bring them all back to a life and they command over that whole thing you will go back the way you were I command every spirit of every person somebody come back into their body and life will be restored now I know I've told you before all the people came back from the dead that were burnt but the plane also came back together like it never happened and because she was the reporter they all saw it all over the world because he's not doing things in secret they will be done openly manifests the way word manifest means to clearly and plainly make known you're living in those days and I'm just giving you a warning a heads-up then it will happen to you sometime in your life it's gonna happen and the mass dead raising the raising of the masses of dead it's going to happen in our lifetime it's going to happen that means if somebody went somewhere some evil harming and the use chemical warfare and the whole entire place was dead you will go in there and speak God's Word whatever God says for you to say you speak and everyone who is dead would be alive whole and well and all the any remnants of that chemicals on the entire city the ground the air the water will be gone in Jesus name people are gonna know and this is his real reason for doing that they will know there is a God and we only do this because of him we can't do this without him but we will do it for him and with him and God's plan is to erase the whole gray area that says there is no God so I know I've seen millions of Muslims running to the kingdom I've been shown millions of homosexuals run into the kingdom and as they ran into the kingdom they got all their body parts back like God made them God does care about them and I can tell you this I'm messing around this some of those people has some of the greatest callings on their life or the devil would not have messed him up and they think you were born that way but God doesn't make anybody that way because that is not his image and we are made in His image there'll be some of the greatest witnesses amen Jesus even appearing before the scene he not the Sanhedrin you know he just said to me I already did that he does have a sense of humor and he's like but here beside me walking with ya I know he's in me but he's also walking with me he'll tell me things to say thing to talk about because he loves this time amen he's been appearing in person to the Taliban even to some of the ISIS like face to face with them someone I know was going around preaching these they preach a lot in the Middle East and they went into this country where they're the the Taliban were actually in this country he's fearless this person is fearless he's done all kinds of certain signs and wonders for God in those countries and then he went in that country and separately I thought if he was going on the sides to be one of us all these Muslims came out to him and the one in the front had a Bible under holding a Bible on their head they were walking to him not with guns now in machine guns not wanting to blow him up which was what most of them I do their walk around with a Bible on his head and they went up and said the 1-cos speaking that's it did you bring Bibles with you you have any Bibles because I've been reading this one to them and they want to know that God they want to know Jesus Christ do you have any Bibles you have Bibles that we can have because of one of them having the Word of God they didn't burn it they didn't throw it away God moved on them to read it and they begin to see a different kind of God then who they worshiped and that whole group got saved that was that was a suddenly the other thing that is for this time are suddenly say suddenly say something will happen overnight and it will change me forever it's called a suddenly [Music] it's called a suddenly because we're in an accelerated time even in our own country here in America so many things have already been shifted and begin to change in a short amount of time over the years we've fought there's been so many jobs lost in this country it wasn't just because of one one leader it's just happened the economy has really gone down and this time it will prosper and flourish like it never has before because of God's plan of our obedience and because Jesus is here taking over ok that there will be one suddenly after another in our economy and and since we now have a righteous man in the Supreme Court and I started talking about Kavanagh and stopped but we will have one suddenly after another in this country because this is God's plan and we're ready for it amen but but in a little bit over just a year or so two million jobs have been created in this country and in my own City I see signs everywhere we are hiring hiring hiring hiring we have so much hiring going on in our city and when I visit places I see those same signs they're hiring because they have money and their business is increasing that means they need more people this is a good time to get into business amen and I like to tell people what Jesus says to me he said I was sawn I was sent into the business arena I was first known in the business arena a carpenter he said my father did not send me as pastor Jesus he didn't he sent him as a business man who could connect with every area and everywhere whatever the arenas were he could connect with him because he was a businessman why was the eating with the sinners people wanna know how come he was sit with sinners because he had business contracts with them he was a master carpenter he had the best home they knew he did really good stuff so he had all kinds of business contracts all the time Heymann had him with the sinners and they liked him business is a good Avenue to take the gospel that's why he's sending me as a business woman I know I have revelation I know talk about the wild things of God he gave me that revelation he gave it to me I never said John said okay I want this this and this I only asked him for love I wanted to love him I asked him for more love I'm gonna be like my earthly father was who was filled with so much of the love of God he literally loved his enemies and had fun doing it i understanding i understand the blessing that curse it's a whole lot more fun to bless people who don't like you it gives the devil a really bad day and it goes into the soul of that person and it makes you happy cuz it's better to give dad my dad lived by that so I give away stuff all the time I had them come home from work there'd be stuff missing he knew I gave it away my dad did that we get I give away food people give me suffer give it away I get money I give it away that's why I have a CFO that takes care of the money I won't be able to go anywhere I'm gonna make any products when I first got products at game all away I gave all my books away I'm gonna bless you here's okay 500 books away marbles where's the books I bless the people she says those were supposed to be sold so we could get more and then you can take some of them and give them away blessed people so from now on those products aren't coming to you they're being shipped to me every what happen on the products table because my dad has such a heart to love and care he didn't care what color you were he didn't care what he didn't even care what your faith was he was gonna love you bless you and feed you he was a good example for me that's why you got to have people that can do the other stuff even in business you can have a visionary the visionary he's so excited and passionate about everything if you don't have something there to help you with your money you're gonna have none unless you have both of those gifts you need someone who could be administrator if you're thinking about going to business make sure you have that other half that you don't have you can have a vision the parks look amazing but if you don't have someone to make sure things are done right or kept like all the licenses and permits are renewed the insurance is being paid you know the taxes are being paid you better have something that can do that keep track of stuff for you okay and keep it multi trillionaire didn't give whole warehouses away if you want to this is also a time for money to be manifested in great amounts to us the wealth of the wicked and then I receive it - I'm gonna receive that and people gonna want oh we know we're getting out of here why did you why'd you tell those people those things we want to leave I want that's not contain ship time you don't know what time he's coming back that's what we have some pins back there magnets as they roll up your rapture rug that's Holy Spirit yells that everywhere he goes roll up your rapture rug that's not what he meant by occupy but that's what I was taught my whole life in church Jesus could come next week you might come tomorrow oh and I don't think you know that I think we should be encouraged to be here stay here do something make a difference and don't buy the c-rations it tastes awful I don't even think the raccoons would eat them people would send us stuff in the mail when I don't think I want this we throw it on the back patio we have a raccoon you know assembly that comes every now and then they picked it up and threw it back down and what we are not eating those okay if the raccoons with Needleman a garbage they are a bitter one I don't want it amen they like doughnuts those raccoons were getting like that fat we finally finally have stopped feeding Emily because when we leave there no one's gonna feed them okay they're not it doesn't say that the Lord will set a table for them you could set a table for us so yeah people come to my house and the raccoons are staring this like last door and they'll go down knock on the doors if you throw something out there like a sub sandwich they'll scrape all the lettuce and tomatoes out not eating that stuff peep out that you're hurting the know we've never had a single one die that have been flourishing bountifully prospering in every way the only issue is we've got something to keep him away from coming over the preserve work next to preserve and the cats we feed out front guess he's meeting the cats yeah they know they're smart they came around the front to get the cats food we have to got them running away away of course they know us so they're like wow you've just moved dinner to the front you go everything moves Pico there make sure the raccoons yeah but there go go away go away they like us that's why I my I actually just redid my whole bio to send out to the pastures now who invite me and I've added to a tormentor of demons apply for a job somewhere to put it on there and see what people say to you it is a great thing I've had 25 years business experience you know and all these people and companies I've worked for and everything and then I say you know and you go on down the little list there you know I've done this done that achieve that wow that whatever and then I go I'm a tormentor of demons I speak to the weather you know and the storm stops and I live with my husband so many years of success with the resident raccoons is a crazy squirrel and some rescue cats that's either going to impress them with nothing to do you I don't I don't have to give up resumes now but that would have been really nice to give that out right be different this is the time for great extreme extravagant favor for the body of Christ like we have never had it before and God told me in America there will be a time when people will be proud that they have you know Christians for their friends the singers will be proud to announce oh why not have a couple Christians that are my friends they go you have Christians what do they talk about do they raise the dead you seen them raise the dad do they have fire coming out of their head because we saw some of that on the internet we want to know do you know any other Christians that might want friends cuz they're not doing that right now but they will it's a time for freedom and I'm also fill this in for free but there will come a time that even the wild animals will be at peace with us in this earth they won't attack they will have no fear of us because we'll have so much of God's presence and our life they will trust us and I'm talking about four generations that will happen and then when the last last days come there's a scripture in the Bible that kind of talks about that but it talks about the beasts of the field will come and attack the people and the people will be shocked because it hasn't happened for generations because of heaven being in this earth and we allow it to be in our lives we operate and and you know in the supernatural with Jesus Christ he lives in you he's gonna operate through you then things are going to be drastically different in this earth if you apply for a job in the government you'll probably be hired immediately because you have Christian on your application this government will be so radically changed and justice will be given like it's supposed to be given and now I'm gonna go back to Cavanaugh for a few minutes when I was watching that where they actually gave the vote remember he won by two votes that was probably by two Democrats that changed their mind some some of them did actually vote for him when they were confronted I think it was that one senator the stood up and said that he was ashamed of all of them he said they're lying and you know you are lying but trying to prove Cavanaugh to be a victor victor to be a perpetrator he said when you say that he is wrong he's committed a crime you're lying and you know that person was paid and she was paid Cavanaugh has been innocent his whole life a strong believer a loving family man even in high school in college so many people who knew him came up they didn't put him on the way to see him but they told the news reporters in anyway you never probably saw that in the news they had so many more people standing with him than against him but they were desperate because nothing else was working so they chose lying and deceiving which is wrong and I'm talking about this is about our justice system this is about telling the truth this whole thing was about telling the truth is that right it wasn't just a position it was about the Supreme Court or they're supposed to you know make sure truth is being done and justice is being given while they weren't given him justice and the father was telling me in heaven he will win that seat and I will make sure he wins that seat I don't care what they try what they say he is absolutely innocent and he himself will have justice in that moment and he said and when he wins the seat he is one to see for heaven on the Supreme Court because he's a believer and he said yes to God we said yes to God you give him permission to operate in you in your household in your business and so when I was watching all this going on God said when they said you know he had one God said this moment I am sending three special ops angels to be with him the whole time he's on the earth the whole time he's in the Supreme Court which will be a long long time he said these angels will keep him from all harm and no one who comes against him will succeed and he said these angels are some of them wants the hosts the army who fought for Israel in the flesh that's why they're special ops special operatives that's how importance is to God he said when he won he won me a seat God said he won me a seat in Supreme Court [Applause] he is serious about justice and at the moment that they said that he had one you know it was fifty two forty eight and it's them they said he had one I heard millions of little babies in heaven celebrating and I heard them shouting now in America freedom will come to all the little babies and what was allowed for us to die will be struck down and the future is gonna be great for the little babies being born in America amen if you think heaven wasn't involved in that they were very involved even the ones living there were involved but especially the little babies and ones that were aborted that live in heaven they were shouting and celebrating they knew what was going on in the earth they knew how important that he won that seat because they will overturn Roe vs. Wade [Applause] thank you Jesus amen heaven is very excited about this time if you have family members living there they are all cheering right now because heaven is shifting our government so they can then shape the future of this nation and people will come to this country to find God amen so this is definitely a time for freedom and everyone will benefit from it even the ones who didn't want it and you can get so far into deception you don't realizing you don't realize because of the heat of the moment and being used by the enemy you cannot even you can't even I'm trying to think I don't not very good with with human words yeah you can't comprehend what you're saying yes to how that would affect your future and they're not realizing that they were damaging the future of their generations coming on the earth and then I will just talk about the agenda because I will and God wants me to the agenda of this Democratic Party now not even before but now has has really regressed into darkness so much because they filled their self with hate and judgment and lies that were given and even the fake news are getting physical I mean mental therapy mental help because they've messed up their own soul as you think it in your soul or your heart that is what you will become so what they spew down all the time that's why they can't let it go they have become the very thing that they gave out to everybody they ate it themselves every time they said it and winning their soul and they don't know how to be healed they don't know how to be made whole families were separated I know people there family members will not talk to them if they voted for Trump they've written him off their list like they never existed because their souls were filled with darkness I know Trump wasn't perfect God knows he wasn't perfect but if we dug far enough back and almost everybody's past we should took every every part of the media let's go back in their past 30 years and see what they were doing how about all those senators how about all those Democrats that were voting against Cavanaugh why don't we go back in their life and see what they did way back when but when we give our lives to God and whether you know it or not Trump has given his heart to Jesus Christ he's given his heart to Jesus Christ I know a lot of leaders who he calls in all the time Deacon consol he stands in the counsel of the godly which is another reason why the Liberals don't like him because they don't want godliness they don't want righteousness they thought it was bad enough that Trump won and they didn't like him but they realized he was giving God a place in the White House and welcoming God in our country they really got terrified thinking it's all over if he stays in there we'll lose everything we've gained over the last twenty thirty years we'll lose it all we need to do something to stop this but they can't they can't and every time they try to do something they desist on heaven they will lose they'll lose in the elections they'll lose in areas of business they lose in areas of the government because this is God's divine time and when you said right before the election I'm turning that map red whether anyone likes it or not I'm putting my hand on America I'm gonna move across it when they wake up in the morning they will find out that map is red was it red well get ready for the midterm elections [Applause] it's gonna turn it red again because this is his plan and it goes from the top down and our president is saying yes to freedom yes to liberty yester prospering yester protecting our country yes to a sound military yes to the rights of the believers being restored right over to in the Johnson amendment they said they couldn't speak from their pulpit about about the but you know about voting his stuff they couldn't have a political platform at all which wasn't fair because every other group could do it it didn't matter what they were they could be Satanists and they still let them have a political platform it didn't matter what kind of platform that but then but not Christians because we are a threat to the darkness amen so God is moving powerfully on our country so when Cavanaugh won that was a great victory for justice for generations so you should be really excited and celebrate every day of your life that God chose this time and he said I'm starting with America because I know who's going to win I know what their whole plan is I know the body of Christ had been praying and praying for years that he would come and heal our land and all those prayers were collected in bowls and they were chipped amen they were chipped so everyone who prayed that prayer Chronicles for generations in the past are a part of our victory today amen because he is healing our land and things are going to get better not worse amen so vote Republican I November to make sure you go vote there'll be angels in every voting booth [Music] people like you just wild yes I am I'm acting just like heaven because guess what they have seen the future they know the future when your loved one goes home God shows them the future they know what you're gonna be doing you're you're just you know you the generations after you won't be doing he knows it all he's been from the end at the beginning the beginning to the end and he knows all of it and he knows who he chooses is going to be what he wants him to be amen so I don't even know what time it is what time is it okay see I don't that's too small so that's what he wanted to talk about tonight he had me wear my patriotic and before when you allow the burning of our flag that flag will fly high everywhere and that image is being put on every kind of product possible you'll see a lot more red white and blue I saw hope businesses painting their businesses red white and blue I did everywhere I went and you know I've been placed aboard the red white and blue buildings clothing with it on it even some cars were painted red white and blue and I promise you you watch and see how many me how many automobile I didn't know what to call them the manufacturers Saint you Holy Spirit begin to send those cars and trucks out painted red white and blue it's going to happen more and more and more and our flag will be honored because it represents Christ event it represents Christ and America belongs to God America is a Christian nation [Applause] so I'm always happy to talk about America that is beautiful because God is here amen and along with that and the body of Christ beginning to manifest in amazing stunning shocking miraculous things that that is one of the reasons why God waited for the internet to do this because no one can stop those signs and wonders being seen all over the world amen I think a lot of people in this country are very tired of doom and gloom predictions this is not the time for God to use whether as judgment it's not this is the day of his power not the day of his wrath those things are recorded in the very end of the Bible don't jump ahead okay make sure we all walk out our lives and God's timeline this is the time for us to stop those things and it'd be strange that something is allowed to bring destruction through the weather because we won't tolerate it so how many people here have already be become weather warriors can I see our hands in here yeah where's the weather warrior you're taking authority over the storm every time and let me tell you the the meteorologists don't know what's wrong with their minds just like the fake news don't know what's going on the meteorologists don't know what's going on actually we actually typed out one of the reports after lane that was the hurricane that was opposed to hit Hawaii I think was a category 4 and it wasn't very far if this is going to hit hit the coast it's gonna do wipe out buildings and many people will be killed and the storm surge will go over the whole I mean they were making the most destructive you ever noticed how they're getting more destructive with her with her forecast like I understand if a storm comes but it's not wiping everybody out in the state okay it's not they're getting and the thing is this if it doesn't happen they have to fake it I don't know if any of you've seen that I have friends in Florida when one storm came through and it went down the middle and did almost no destruction it actually just did bypass Tampa completely and they were saying Tampa is gonna be head-on it's gonna wipe everybody out there was nothing and I think Roy fields if you know him Roy feels powerful recording artists he's been he was in the Lakeland revival he sings a lot for a lot of known his way he put it was remember the what he put it who's who in the Christian leaders ooh he said I have sung for them I have sung for them and he said but I've never heard this revelation before in my life I had had a chance to meet him and talk to him for about an hour and then his life was totally different he said we all need this revelation to know who we are he said I didn't even know who I was I didn't know I didn't know I lived in God before I was here I didn't know what actually was his offspring and so his whole life he had his head out of there encounter since then he came as the worship leader of the last cruise I was on and and he had an amazing time so revelation changes you but he himself had reported it on Facebook that they were trying to fake the storm doing destruction in his own City which was Kissimmee Florida and there wasn't any and they had like wind machines out there they have water like rising up around this and he said I'm standing out my street like there's not a drop of rain on me so he actually turned him in Peter Nevins said no there's none of that's going on and then we did have a report when it hit you know in Panama City I think I said and I'm trying to think I said neither said the airport or something was flooded with all the rain and that bill when they showed that was not even from there you have to understand they have got years of destruction of storms years of them and so they've been using some of them I'm not saying it wasn't actually saying there wasn't nothing that happened but even in Florence I do know there was there was flooding and stuff like that but you need to realize that if that category that storm and hit head-on they would have blown the buildings off the beach there would be no buildings there'd be nobody because it's like it was like a bowl and when that went think a mature it was a tropical storm it started as a four till we started taking authority over and you saw every single day the news media would say it would get stronger but it got downgraded and it even showed this thing zigzag because every time we would hit it it was exact and they went this is the weirdest storm in the history of meteorology we've never we could never predict it because we were telling it what it couldn't do the believers the sinners can't do that you don't have authority over the storms but the cuts again on Facebook you're gonna start a whole new move of God move of God means it's not gonna stop I've called the weather warriors and I will start in that way with the Bight of Christ who doesn't care whose denomination they belong to because those things affect everybody everywhere they're gonna lay down all I've no one ever said it was assembly god I'm Baptists I'm not I mean nobody ever said that to me on all the comments they never said that I'm so glad that we're taking authority over the storm of the body of Christ that's coming together we're doing this together and we are defeating them it was powerful amen so why don't we stand up and do something if you've never done it before we're going to take authority over the storms that are out there right now and the reason why they've been doing such horrible destruction is because we have let it happen Satan has run rampant earth ruling and reigning and the only ones who really could stop him was the body of Christ filled with Jesus Christ because we've been given power over all the power of the enemy Christ stop the storm amen and he said the things I did you will do is that true well we haven't been doing all the things but we are now so we're going to do this together say I choose as a child of God through the blood of Jesus Christ I take power over all the power of the enemy operating through any storm out there whether it's a tropical storm a hurricane no matter what it is we take power over that we come in the middle of ours to rise in that storm so the high pressure will crush us storm it will be downgraded until it becomes nothing we command the hosts of heaven to go in the storms begin to shred the bands all the way around the storm [Applause] we receive justice through the weather through Jesus Christ so be it amen amen amen sit down so we did it through the but Jesus gave us power worth while the enemy God did not on purpose create destructive weather to kill steal and destroy guess who kills steals and destroys yeah the devil does and now he's losing that remember the keys in hell that Christ took away from him death hell and the grave were those storms bring death and we were also given the keys to the kingdom is that right so Jesus has given us keys he's given his power and authority he's given us declarations he's given as an example how he lived his life we are joint heirs with him I was in law for eight years I totally understand what being a joint heir is you have the rights whatever he had we have whatever you did we can do that's what that means you're a joint heir the last Testament is the last will and testament of Jesus Christ just like in law he gave us us rights in that well amen and when he died and was risen again he even gave us power over death so you don't have to die from sickness and disease even as your soul prospers you will prosper and be in health it is so powerful to understand what the word means and how to apply it to your life that is getting training every missionary should know about commanding the host of heaven and sending them against all the darkness in the countries that their Minister being missionaries in anyone who works against human trafficking should know about using the host that is heavens army that was not created to defend heaven then didn't get to fight when Lucifer fell not one angel fought against any of those one-third of the angels God kicked him out on a lightning bolt he made heaven it is his home he is in charge of heaven so why did he make the hosts why did he make them there's a scroll in heaven that has been opened recently that talks about the destiny of the hosts that they cannot complete their own destiny without us they cannot on their own decide to go attack hell it would have been wiped out already they can't just get together and say ok let's see today we're gonna go to this country and wipe out all this we're gonna then we're going to go this one we're gonna do all this they have to have orders now I know they have positions they have inspectors they have people who command certain parts of the army they have positions like inspector to transport they have a scout to go behind the enemy lines and film all the activities of hell it goes back to headquarters heaven they have all of these positions that's why we have those positions in our army even in our own army those troops on her own the privates can get together and try to drive weapons off somewhere and attack something they can't do that they have to have orders as the military to operate and so does Heaven's military but we were created to be commanders there's many scriptures in the Bible that talked about commanding even God said command ye me didn't he he was not saying tell me what to do he was saying you command what will be done if you already know God you know what his desire is for something you already know it you're living righteous correct then you can call the army to come and fight on your behalf and not just fight on your head behalf but command it or God wouldn't say command Jesus was also the Lord of Hosts he was over the army what he did we can do I'm not here to tell you all the Scriptures I'm just telling you you need to command the army of heaven but the first thing you have to do is you have to realize that you were given power say the hosts of heaven we're not given power over all the power of the enemy say the angels are under us not over us do you understand that we came from inside God himself we are his offspring he spoke and the angels were made they were sent to protect us and keep us in all of our ways now some people knew that and they operated in that that's happened with people before but in this time he wants the body of Christ to realize stop fighting his plans the enemy wants you to fight God's plans because then you won't become what he wants you to become which is dangerous just a matter what your age is your position is how much money you have it doesn't matter if you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior then wash clean of all your sins you're kind of righteous you have entrance into heaven into all of eternity why wouldn't you be able to man say we're kings and priests unto our God those are spiritual levels of authority say every King commands an army in the earth as the body of Christ we are in the kingdom a spiritual Kingdom we have spiritual weapons we get to use them to pull down strongholds of darkness so wherever darkness is and evil is operating we can do something about it amen in this time off living yeah the Holy Spirit would always yell at me don't try it you do it don't just try it if we're supposed to live in a way that nothing by any means will harm us and people can quote that scripture all day long and yet harm comes to you doesn't it we're attacked by the enemy aren't we yeah well the army was designed and created to stop those attacks to keep you in all your ways amen because when we are free of fear of being attacked we can push back the enemy because he certainly is not expecting it so he doesn't like this meeting he doesn't like these words he doesn't like me at all that's okay I don't like him either he's on the bottom of my list actually he's under my feet he is our doormat the Bible even says so so we're not under but we are over because we rule and reign with Christ and the Bible says in this life not talk them up you know later on we will - not that they will not in the in the next life not your life but in the next time when there is no time when time is no more that's the end not the end of everything is the end of time when time when you don't have to have calendars and your body's not going to age and you have to be concerned about am I gonna have this to do that when that time of timeless comes when we're timeless I'm asking for that right now but you asked what you believe in your house do not doubt you should have whatsoever you say I'm saying I'm timeless he is reversing back to my youth the people in heaven are timeless no one is old if your grandmother or great-grandmother moved to heaven at 99 she is not coming back when they step out of this body they're 99 this step of the wrinkled right wrinkled hard of hearing their sight I say it's going they probably don't feel very good they can't run a job and they step out of that body no because of 25 do you think they're going back they aren't they'll pray for you and declare over you and make plans for you in heaven but they are not coming back they won't be happy and the day when we are timeless there will be no war no evil no sickness no disease no lack no threats no rejection of any kind and we will live like that through eternity but we can still create we can invent we can speak to things and they will appear you can ride on light you can ride on music be transported to light do time you have planets to visit for vacation the new heaven will be your home but you're going vacation to other planets he says there will be a new earth new heaven say it and a new earth the earth will not just be God's home in my father's house this is Jesus speaking in his house that's the world in this world this home that's called heaven are many mansions that's what's going on now but at the end of time when he makes a new earth bigger than our galaxy a massive earth that has one landmass in an ocean I know there'll be no more seas the sea separate the land masses but as long as God exists the river of life will never stop flowing from him that's how the crystal sea is made in heaven on the bottom is not saying just gemstones they flow out of the Father they're a part of him so if you should one day wake up and you have emeralds in your skin as a bracelet that's the father's image not even New Age can do that the devil tries to steal as much as he can he lived there remember he knew how things worked in a lot of things he says or his we're never is your life and eternity will be the most most splendors wondrous thing you've ever experienced people move to have a noun for R&R because they won't be there one day they'll be moving to the father's house right now they have a place in the father's house is that what the word says right now they go to prepare a place for you and the world called heaven which is the father's house but on the new earth it will be our house and he's going to pack his bags and climb on the New Jerusalem and we'll come down to the new earth and he'll be with us forever so even he is willing to move with this whole plan for eternity and we will be timeless we will have glorified bodies we will be immortal all of this is in the word mortality will take on immortality when he said know ye not that your gods that's the little G that's what he was talking about one day we'll be immortal like them we'll never die never sin will never lack we'll be timeless there'll be no time in heaven there's no time in the new earth and he'll create all these new things for us to go and put things on it for us to enjoy and have fun every planet will be different and you won't need a spacesuit or a spaceship to go there you'll be timeless this is a beautiful future isn't it so this little bit of time that we are on this earth but we will get to do supernatural the Bible says will be a type and group of people a generation a type and group of people those are those manifested sons and daughters of God it wasn't about Israel becoming a nation I know a lot of people think that generation was the generation they would still be here when Jesus came but a lot of them I've already died moved to heaven haven't they that was in 1948 is that correct Rick got that one in 1948 a miracle happened in Israel do what I'll fix my fix it is it falling off thank you for telling me honey I just I pinned my scars down these little scarves they'd be all the way on the floor I'd walk around with one little piece up here and it's on the floor I'm draggin and nobody ever told me nobody ever said oh my your scarf is swimming off of you so my team have little signs you see they give but you know he just kinda lets it go sometimes so we have been chosen by God to be here or you wouldn't be alive and sitting there people go maybe I wasn't chosen are you alive are you breathing were you born in this time you were chosen you were chosen and you're representing all those who went before you and you don't know who lived a thousand years ago maybe you do maybe you don't know but somewhere in your generational line was someone who laid down their life for the gospel and what he is doing is putting on the earth right now those who generational line somewhere lay down their life for the gospel so don't say you didn't have anybody you had somebody or you wouldn't be sitting here we get to help complete their destiny because he gives a destiny or a purpose for a generational line and even though they didn't get to complete it they started it they share and the same reward we got that's why they're so excited that you're here right now you are remember the body of Christ you are going to reap reward for you and them and they watch you do it they won't miss one time that you win someone to the Lord they won't miss one time that you manifest for God in this earth they will see all of it because we have a cloud of witnesses is that right according to Hebrews 12:1 we have a great cloud of witnesses watching our race that means they get to see it and they're excited and they're all cheering heaven is cheering they laugh every time Satan fails and he can hear them all the way down into hell and heaven roared the other day they're gonna roar on November 6 so I've really enjoyed this time with y'all I hope you were blessed by heaven amen amen and so just we never I told you all these things that I will be working God walked in the wall through the wall of my hotel room a couple months ago and he wrote on the wall literally what I'd be doing for the next 50 years that's not the end of my assignment but he wrote for 50 years the platforms I would speak from the very first one he was switching now don't be concerned I've been spending years many years revealing heaven but I'm in my next phase which is creating heaven to put in the marketplace a lot of people heard me talk about this a while we literally are this year starting to put things in the marketplace that look like heaven sound like heaven you'll be eating off of it wearing it walking on it listening to it you'll have walls that move and say things that's in heaven and so we're doing that now so he changed and switched my priority number one is the business world the marketplace the business world being CEO and putting stuff in the marketplace it represents heaven that this people really people in this world need that because right now Satan has put his mark on everything you wear it you have to stand you look at it it's in design it's an interior design architectural design it's in clothing it's an accessories it's in-home stuff isn't everything it's in all the schools it's everywhere so God is now putting heaven there amen and you can have things that represent in heaven and so I have to do that or we won't be there I'm not saying other people won't do it but we will majorly be impacting this world amen and number two will still be revealing heaven and training the body of Christ but number three will be the arts and entertainment world which means Hollywood so I will be seeing many times with celebrities in Hollywood directors producers and don't do it a lot about the Christians do oh my gosh that person's over there talking to Holly bit they're gonna go down the hole no Hollywood's changing how it was changing what they're gonna produce what they're gonna put out there what they're gonna market and even places of entertainment never had before and earth will be created for you to go and have good family fun Amen new hotel designs it's in it's totally invaded with heaven that the stuff in the rooms the stuff in the walls the stuff displayed there the things you can do while you're there it's all changing whole amusement parks will be lined up with what heaven is doing in the earth right now video games will be shown that young people can be part of working with heavens army destroying the darkness pushing back you know the evil and these video games instead of being invaded by hell they'll be invaded by heaven all kinds of things whatever young people like we're making it with heaven in it and so we all will have movies in the movie theaters that show a lot about heaven of time of the spirit round the spirit realm the spirit world they want the spirit realm they want that unseen realm they're so hungry for the unseen realm it's not a fake it's not a fantasy you know they'll stop running after maybe so superheroes for a while but definitely aliens will be put on the back burner although some of the hosts look like them so I just want to thank you for come tomorrow I have another powerful message to give to encourage and inspire you it's gonna be amazing you're gonna get some protocol from heaven on how to work with the army of heaven and things about your life to be accountable so that you can work with them because tell you heaven I know they hear the prayers of sinners people think they don't but they do he hears the prayers of sinners he couldn't he couldn't answer them amen heaven here's everybody's words but the army is not going to listen to someone trying to command them when they're sinning when they're sweating people you're not going to do it they will stay in there and stare at you so if you want to be a part of using them as one of your spiritual weapons and sending them all over this world the potent strongholds of darkness expose the wicked people themselves take them down not kill them unless they have to I will let you know this that I do know like for Cavanaugh God is releasing ho I'm trying remember what do you call like a truth beam a group of military like what aliens yeah he's sending ho battalions of the hosts that have flesh on them and they were the ones that fought against the armies of Israel they actually fought in the flesh and fought against the flesh they are being released into this earth to keep the lives of those who say yes who say who are willing who are bidden who say yes and who live your life the way we should is an example of Christ so there are things gonna be change I'll be talking about more of that tomorrow and some of the strategies for sending the hosts you need to do it it will change your life you'll never be in a traffic accident you own your plane will be the safest plane in the sky because they will carry you through the sky you can you will not escape seeing parts of your army because they will live over your home they're not gonna be snow no Simon and go back to heaven they're being assigned to earth to the body of Christ who can command and that is your choice so is there anything else in salsa dude I will get a great night's sleep so thank you for blessing me for coming in man you can't

or https://youtu.be/yUdrV8fbt5Q
let's welcome cat everyone up here okay being the mother of three highly anointed dancers who were born years apart from each other I planned mine being 1:15 I thought if I ever have them being number three out of 15 I said if I ever have them I'm planning them on purpose far apart so I can enjoy my life in between and get to know each one of them so I did I had them five years apart within the same month but five years apart except the middle one I needed seven years before I had to turn off but God was amazing he gave them all the exact same gift their natural gift they will still use in heaven is dance they've danced probably some of them for 30 years some 25 years and highly gifted they've raised the debt by dancing they've had people more actually healed by dancing they do intercession and warfare by dancing so much so that my middle daughter has brass knuckles this big tattooed on the top of her feet because there are weapons of God God told her to do it and so everywhere she goes she would have pink hair purple hair she was on so you think you could dance so she could witness and testifies to the judges because she had already been dancing since she was four so what I think she's like 20 something after 20 years of dance she went said I'm going to testify I know they won't put me all the way through because I'll be preaching the gospel at one point and they passed her through every test she mentored sixty other dancers who were going to be trying out because they all had to wait in a room for five days as you waited for your turn and the first day you showed up they they gave you a test they played music for 10 seconds have you passed those judges you were in for the rest of the thing and so every level she would pass every level so she got her try on the platform so she could testify and her here at that time was cut a little bit shorter but it was red with purple overtones and she had her she had a Rose of Sharon on her arm her brass knuckles on her feet and it was modern dance so she didn't have to wear shoes and this was her moment they played the music and she dances so powerfully anointed people just sit there like stunned they don't know what to do they don't know what it is so they said and the whole time she's preparing what she was going to save them and so they said well we know who you are you must be really hot they said the wrong word so why are you here look at you your cool tattoos and she stood up with her moment she said you think you know who I am but I'm a believer in Jesus Christ I get my anointing from him I dance and warfare and worship I destroy the darkness through my movements I make every movement I make us for him it is to worship Him he is my God I will serve no other and they all were sitting there stunned and they finally said we can't pass you through nope nope nope nope we can't pleasure they were so terrified thinking she would do that while she did it on stage she said I did not come to win I came to testify to you that God has young people in this earth so down on fire for him who will not compromise with the world but will make a stand for righteousness and holiness and that's why I came and I fulfilled my commission and they centered and all of the younger people cuz you know they're like what 1718 cent like that and they were so angry because she was so powerful that wasn't fair she said I didn't come to win and every day they meet in this room and they'd all get tweaked you know they do their their thing trying to get better she helped every one of them with their with their routines and she would make them pray first and these kids were from all over the world in every walk of life in every ethnic group and they learned to pray to Jesus and she was um she's don't you ever stop praying he gave you that gift I'll be rooting for every one of you and so this is the heart of my daughter's this is what they were raised in that that was who they were they weren't something else they never went into the world to find out who they were they knew they all still dance they all still minister they performed some have dance companies and and they're very powerful and I'm blessed that God said if you raise up in child and the way he made them to be they will never depart from that because it's knowing their gift and being that gift so I love dance I have 20 years of videos of taping I was the videographer I don't have a clue about dance myself I can't dance except in one day and so I teach everybody when they go somewhere I've been throwing out a Jazzercise classes so that shows you that was not my gift but we got to see all these years of them using that gift they never dropped it and one of them has actually danced here before Kim my daughter Kim and she wants to come back she's gonna help me talk to you about doing an arts a whole arts it's called arts alive and they'll she'll teach dance they have artists that will teach art and they have others that will teach worship you know powerful it's powerful it's like a two day event and and people come in for the first time learn how to express yourself and dance so she has two classes one for those who have experience and those who have no experience and you'll never be the same again and like the fine art is beautiful and amazing they teach you prophetic art like with brushes and paints and stuff and then the worship thing is phenomenal and these are all experts in their field professionals in their field and Kim said as it was leaving mom make sure you asked them and see if they want us to come you know we would love to come yeah she wants to very much come and do that so I'll have to let her know the answers yes but when they started because dance is one of the hottest things done in the throne room it's called in sums 149 it's high praise read Psalms 149 it talks about dance being high praise it binds the enemy in fetters of iron it's a very powerful weapon it is worship but it's also warfare and I want you to know when they first started the fire started pouring down from heaven blue fire blue fire was coming down all over this platform it was around every single dancer and then about halfway through the line of Judah walked in that wall right here huge lion it was Jesus and receiving the honor and the praise they were all dancing around him they didn't couldn't probably see that the other thing that happened was I almost never see this but the Seraphim showed up the Seraphim live over the throne in a cloud of glory and they come down and they do dance in the air above the throne their heads are so on fire with blue fire their hair is blue fire and they were right up here in between these two areas right here and they would dip down and bring more release more fire in here on the dancers so the throat the throne-room was here today okay receiving the honor and the praise from the dancers it's a very glorious thing in heaven to see that happen and so I was delighted when I came and they danced cuz I love to see that I love to see it's very powerful and so truly one of their dance directors was very ill one time and so my oldest daughter and my middle daughter who actually ended up by teaching and taken over the studio for a while danced and she was raised up off her deathbed and they did it for that purpose they were interceding for her to be made whole and she lived she was raised up from the dead and she lived another 10 years a wonderful the first Christian dance company in our entire city the company became 200 members in the company and then the director needed a new knee so my oldest daughter took over the company and three studios and worked all over for her and gave her all the money and so because she loved her because from the time she was 8 she had taught her she used to dance the the director with the New York City Ballet and she had danced all over the world we decided at one point I'm done with this I'm giving myself to Jesus and she got saved and came and started the father's company and so powerfully effective impacted our whole city and now Miss Laury is in heaven watching right now so so dance is something wonderful if you're if you're any of your children they had some guys that did too they didn't wear tutus at anymore tights but they were powerful dancers also and I know people you say dance a picture all ballet there's many other forms of dance you know that they can be involved in and and I loved it with your I was trying to remember what the father calls it and with your battle stick he calls it a battle stick they have those in the throne rooms and the men are the ones who use them in the zone I'm like wow they really got heaven here today and some of you may not even understand what I'm talking about but it's a powerful thing to connect with heaven and then you duplicate it down here okay so if you don't have a church this is a powerful place to come god loves this place not that he doesn't love other places but they give everything to him their lives their gifts and they do it on purpose and intentionally and they're passionate about it God loves to see passion and his people he loves it when you respond when you yell when you get excited when you jump up and down he loves let me tell you heaven is not a quiet place if you're expecting it to change your mindset because if you're 80 you won't feel 80 in heaven you'd be like 20 and if you're already young when you get there you are so excited beyond reason the things that you get to experience and do in heaven they don't even have on this earth heaven is not earth the earth is only a shadow literally a shadow of what is in heaven it's way beyond your imagination don't ever limit God in your lives even here not even here and so never thought I would be chosen to do this not ever in my wildest dreams I didn't like talking to anybody I didn't want anybody to hug me or touch me I was a covert person from the beginning and yet had to be a leader at age eight over my siblings and help and then when as I got older it just increased but I was a very faithful and committed to help my parents I was on my parents side that did not make me popular with the rest of my siblings and being a seer and having supernatural discernment even when I'm like eight nine and ten they didn't get away with anything I was literally know what they were gonna do before they even got to do it okay and so I've met and go retrieve them or whatever they were thought they were going to get into it never happened and my mom would always say I'm leaving you to be in charge the house will still be here they won't burn it down you know they won't have fights in the streets I mean when you got that many kids together and that many personalities there's gonna be a lot of action all the time and so uh and in my husband that God made me marry he said this is one I chose before you were born this is who I chose to you to marry I need you to marry him I need the holy seed you're gonna produce I mean this is how direct God is with me how detailed he is with me and he said you're gonna have three daughters and I need them born into this earth I tried to get out of having the last one that didn't happen I am paid in full right now okay and I only have one that's not married yet and she thinks you might want to be I'm not quite sure about that we'll see what happens nothing is for certain when God's involved in your life and he's got destiny for you he'll get you one way or another okay and that is a that's a good thing it's a god thing be excited for your life he could have had you born 300 years ago nobody would be dressed the way you're dressed nobody would have any of the conveniences of things you would have you know you'd be climbing on some old wagon train hauling around behind cow dung and flies whatever you find and caught that's what you ate you might have a bath once every three months no tell me where that would take place and I for one I always thank God that he had me born now if it had not been the kind of person I didn't like getting dirty I didn't want to get wet I didn't like to sweat that was me so shoving me back 300 years ago I've probably not have been a happy person and so I'm always grateful that I'm born in this special time on the earth well we will see things never seen before on the earth really some things will directly be sent from heaven right in our midst in the most unusual unexpected places a lot of these signs and wonders will not be done even in the midst of a huge big meeting with thousands of people it may be done in your grocery stores [Music] you may take you out through the wall in the grocery store your left your cart will be left behind take you somewhere do some miraculous thing out bring you back your your kosher cart will still be there trust me nobody will take anything out of it and these things will be so spectacular he actually does intend to use you he's not looking for holy recruits out of some of the highest known people you know they're all important they did what they did in the past but in this time God wants teams and groups of people who are willing to work together even though we're different no don't wait for everything trust me we have a team don't wait for every person to line up with the way you think they should be okay if God sent them he sent them and he sent them for a reason and you have to love all them and let them use the gifts God put in them and be excited about it because if all you ever do is complain about those people they're probably never gonna change okay when you can be happy about them and ask God to bless them you actually be surprised at how wonderful they are so you can't expect because he's a powerful days that everything will look perfect or be perfect it will be powerful and there's a big difference between perfect and powerful it will be so powerful when we start coming together and doing things when God says to do it not wait five years to do it but do it he said pray that my people are willing in the day of my power that means lay down your differences you know don't wait for everything to be perfect because we aren't any of us actually perfect right we're all a work in progress but if you have a passion for him and what he wants and he brings other people to be a part of that you should be very excited I get excited all the time although our whole group I don't know of anybody who's perfect know they're all still working on I'm still working on it and so as long as you're going in a forward motion and not sitting and waiting on the side you're gonna do something for God right so I can tell you God is opening more and more the eyes of the everyday believer to begin to see into the spirit realm because it's coming people go well you say things yes I do say things and because I do prophesy that might be in that in the past that could been 10 or 20 years but that's not happening now I know things I said seven years ago are literally happening right now things God showed me I would be doing is happening now and that now is going to open up the whole rest of the floodgate for a lot of other things just to start accelerating we've been in and accelerating the season but more now in the not just the acceleration but we're being motivated to be thrown out there don't look in the mirror and say I don't qualify don't ever say that word you know why you qualify you're alive guy said if you're still alive and you're not in heaven yet you belong to him you're qualified okay the world won't we choose people that they think qualified but God qualifies the chosen it matters what he says about us it matters how why he made us okay so no matter what you think about yourself he qualifies you I was just a little skinny girl they didn't blend well with other people at one point my line I think I talked to two people in all of high school they didn't really know who I was but I was not the person they probably thought I was I did a lot of covert things even for the law they never would have expected me the last person I'm playing earth that they thought could have done some of the things I did and yet God qualifies me and I said yes every time he asked me something and I didn't always have the best attitude growing up I wasn't happy about most things I didn't like almost no food I never slept I mean I was a lot of high maintenance for my mom and she'll assure you of that if she was here right now she would tell me live every day in my life of a strange because I didn't fit the rest of the group you know everybody ate everything they slept normal they did what was expected I never did anything that was expected I ate once a day that was about 1:00 or sleeping I sleep four hours a day so I'm up 20 hours a day what was I gonna do for the extra time I read I was an avid reader I read things that were exciting and interesting I'm an avid horse lover although I don't know one I'm sure I have a herd in heaven and I was fascinated with him you know in the Bible God talks so much about the horse he thinks it's one of the best things he ever made in the animal kingdom he loves horses and we're kind of in horse country right now right I plan one day to have a range somewhere around here with a whole lot of horses I'm not making that up and serious about that I can come and visit my friends and get away I'll have to get away to places already planned in Maine because God said the demand will be so great he'll have to just take me and I'm perfectly happy with that - so get ready to not be normal or think normal and and I will tell you just watch out for the quiet ones you have a child that's quiet there a very deep thinker and God has put a lot in them and I always know when I look around see people real quiet mm-hmm God is gonna do something with you and stick you out there in front of everybody because I was the core I was the quiet when I hardly said anything but all the time things were going on and the spirit around me and so I'm excited today to be here I have given up so much already last night was so powerful it was phenomenal it was so powerful it really was it was amazing and so I always like to ask how many people have never heard me before that are here today any new people a couple people well I don't look normal unless you live in a kurta certain states couple states you know maybe Portland they have a lot of highlights in their hair some places in California do but I learned not everybody does I learn literally last week for a whole week was in Hollywood going over a contract to get a spirit round content for a movie being made right now and that is the resurrection of Jesus Christ to put things in there that people have seen in the Bible but maybe didn't have revelation on it it will be live on the big screen and people will be shocked and stunned to know what Christ did in hell on the third day any man how he wasted hell in their leader is gonna be very powerful and just in case anybody wondered God loves colored highlights in your hair because you're wearing heaven culture this is heaven culture on my head when a lot of people go why you do that you know some places in Florida have highlights that I don't think West Virginia not much in South Carolina you know unless you're a headline or somewhere maybe but when I used to travel through those areas they would come out of the kitchen they would come out of the kitchen where they were cooking to see who I was when it would stop but there were little barbecue places or something like that they all would get around my table and I'm just waiting for their little but we had a meeting right there and it was all talking about heaven and how they lived in heaven and how exciting powerful was and they walked away so stunned you know oh my god am i lights in heaven and we can't have them where we work I want to start prayin it is coming it's gonna become normal just like pierced ears if you weren't around in that day they thought you were gonna go straight to hell if you pierced ears because you were doing idol worship you know like back in Leviticus well we don't live in Leviticus days and I always like to correct people the way they quote scriptures although some of the translations now actually says don't realize yourself to be tattooed they mistranslated that because what it says no Leviticus it says do not marks do not allow marks of the Dead to be put on your body they didn't say don't mark yourself you have marks in heaven that God puts on you it's what you put on you and the reason you put them on you and I have to say that even though people might be uncomfortable you may be living in heaven a point at one point wondering why God ever said that and then you'll get some yourself but it's coming because as we go through time in it's a new time new things are introduced on the earth some men kind of comes goes along with but some of them actually come from heaven and God at one point will ask people personally to put his marks on them like my daughter the brass knuckles on her feet that was before that actually was going around in our city and and she wore sandals in Florida where foot flops or sandals so nobody could miss them right and they knew what she did but when they looked down on her feet Oh do you know you like I don't know your daughter has tattoos of the enemy oh no no that's evidence that she's a gift to crush the enemy that's what those are there for so for all of you who ever wondered about that God will mark you when you get to heaven it says in the Bible that you'll have the mark of the city of your God in your forehead and your God in the palm of your hand which is why Satan wants to use those same two places in the tribulation why did he pick those two places it clearly says that that that number of the item to Christ will be in your palm or in your forehead he only picks what God already has you can't think of anything new himself the microchip is not the mark of the beast and neither is the barcode which they thought it was before the chip came along for forever and ever mankind has tried to picture it so usually in a tract of stuff they just put a big 666 on the forehead or the person that in the Bible track to explain that this was someone who gave themselves to Satan in the in those days that haven't come yet and aren't going to be for quite a while but the barcode and the microchip especially in microchip does it wouldn't count you can't see it say Amen I know if enough about Satan that whatever he does pick will be this big you see a half a mile away people walking down the street because he is adamant about being known and wanted and that day people will have to want that mark no one can be forced at gunpoint to take it a lot of these movies they show about the last days they show people in in cells with guns and stuff threatening them to get it that won't happen that's not reality reality is they will have to choose him as their leader and that is a result of choosing the Antichrist or Satan as their leader that mark that will be clearly seen on the people will be put on them so forget the microchip it's just a good science you know thing to help find people and your pets and stuff or maybe save the fact that you don't have to carry wallets around with you they're always going to be coming up with new technology no one has technology like heaven okay so don't worry about it it's not your job to be concerned about any of that and God wouldn't let you take something that wasn't him anyway you have to remember that you belong to him you gave yourself to him that is not gonna be something that's hidden when that day comes it will not be hidden the people who live in that time will clearly know what they're saying no to or what they're accepting your job is to rule and reign in the power of the Living God and ways never done before you're living in one of those exciting times to be alive on the planet and the Bible says if people who live in heaven could come back it would only be to do that with you to be a part of this time doing the supernatural manifesting for your God on this earth the rain erasing the great area that says there is not a God so that's what they would come back for amen but you're here you're here you're in this meeting and you'll be held accountable by knowing that you were chosen you're breathing you're alive you're not in heaven okay so he's letting anyone who wants to to be a part of what he's doing in this earth you just have to understand don't try to escape don't think that you can live out the time waiting for the rapture to come and I am NOT saying it's not coming he is clearly going to come back when the father sends him what Christ wants you to do is operate in his power say his power supernatural power in front of others to demonstrate there is a God so in the past people were you know they go door to door and you can still do that minister to people when people - cries it's gonna be done a little bit differently not that we'll ever be stopped but there's a lot of people who've already been approached people in this day a lot of them know things that people never knew in the past a lot of its the internet has been used for a lot of God not just evil and that was made by God for His purposes it was never made to be evil but Satan gets involved in every single thing he can get away with don't let him get away with anything with you okay I love what she's helping she said that I say that to him if I see him a lot who are you fooling because I don't belong to you I'm talking about Satan appearing I don't belong to you why are you here you're wasting your time I know I have authority I know I have power over all the power of you and all of yours so you don't waste your time coming here and then he leaves because I put myself under the hand of God no I'm not afraid of anything I've already been told by God if anybody tries to take me my life they will not let them and if you know somebody wants to take your life I will not allow you to pray for them that means they're in very big trouble so I don't have any fear and I'm willing whatever God wants however long he wants to say whatever he wants and I'll have a great opportunity to do that now I'm because of but I'll be involved in I'll get to meet kings and CEOs and millionaires and I promise you they'll hear from God Hollywood's gonna have a lot of God in it amen and I was just a little skinny girl that's what I was as what people thought it was and then later on when I got involved in my church I loved my church I served in my church I loved my pastor and his wife I was very committed and sold out to them and one day God had me write a letter and say I was married to them and they read that letter in church she didn't read my name and they wept and they said we wished everyone here loved us that much that they were committed to hold up our hands to pray for us every day to help us in any way they wanted to I was serious God sent me there to be a blessing amen that meant scrubbing the floors working in children's church doing VBS I have another word for that and won't tell you what I think about that it's a killing station not for the kids question when you're stuck with the 7 year old so 8 year old the three and four year olds were easy when you start thinking you have a mind of your own it changes this one little boy I had was like a thorn in my flesh he always had a better idea it did not matter what we had prepared in VBS you have to have if you are not prepared you will have in our key and mayhem you will be overthrown like a government by well prepared children so you have to have exciting fun things for them to do but this one kid always had a better idea every single name was Micah I should have been suspecting he always wanted to do it his way which was messing up the plan that kid is such a peril of each list go is SiC him on the devil he's very powerful when man I guess it was worth it loving him anyway it is fun to see those you help as children be raised up and be so powerful to forgot I'm gonna I knew you were gonna become something so it's wonderful to have a life sewn to God even in your in perfectness even in your mistakes even in all those things God looks at your heart and he loves every one of you even if you feel alone yourself you are not alone you have angels around you everyone here has angels everyone in here has probably at least 3 to 5 angels you don't have just one some of you have a lot and most of them are very happy right now that you're sitting in those seats because every word ice because anointing in it and it goes in your soul whether you know that or not the words won't leave your soul because God wants you to know you are powerfully made you are so powerfully made if you ever really saw who you were you would be so bold the devil would get so terrified he doesn't attack you because he's afraid he doesn't attack you because he's angry he doesn't get angry he's too smart to be angry he knows what happens when he makes people angry he's gets you stuck but he does attack you because he's terrified of you and he's hoping you never ever find out who you are I've even said this in a men's prison Danone Yin began to hit every one of them the anointing they carried because you got you're given an anointing for some purpose they're very anointing begin I can see it begin to rise out and come and discover them and they begin to weep they begin to shake they never thought of their self that way I'm sure nobody ever came and told them that their treasures hidden in darkness so when light comes in and removes the scales off of their eyes then they get angry at Satan even though they know what they did was wrong and they're paying a price for that they get anything that he trapped him he trapped them he hunted them he got them to fall he kept encouraging them to do wrong then he made them get caught how about man he might have been put away where they would never get to be who they were sent to be and every time I go speak everything every one of the men got saved filled with the Holy Spirit and then I really saw fire of God into them I said whatever God has planned for you you can be powerful right here you can make a difference right here don't you let one demon show their face in this place don't you let them think they have authority over you belong to Jesus Christ you are now a weapon for God in this place and sometimes ho blocks and the prison would get saved including the warden because of these people running after Jesus Christ letting him work Foley through them even in the prisons there's gonna be movement from the prison's one day so maybe you're not in a building but you're in a prison don't stay there god I declare every person in this room right now that has been chosen by you that belongs to you that has a divine purpose I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control any of them steal their destiny crush them beat them up in Jesus name I command the hosts of heaven you get in here right now you pull down every stronghold you shred every platform Satan's been running over in their lives right now that they might be free free free everybody out free free in Jesus name Amen amen that's how you pray over your family get serious about it amen then celebrate because your words are powerful they have life in them they have power in them if Christ lives in you when you speak it's like him speaking amen so you are important to God every person is important there was a lot of them messed up out there they don't even know who he is don't know how much he loves them but the moves that are coming in the habitation that is coming to this earth they will know he's going to move on every single person without permission I know you said well they have to have permission sometimes they do sometimes things are sovereignly done and this already been declared in the world in the last days what does he say do you ever think that through in your head I will pour out my spirit on all flesh that means everybody on the earth without permission I know what that feels like begin to burn on the inside of you too you think you're going to explode then the flood of the life of God comes in on top of that burning and it actually comes out of the pores of your body it consumes your whole head it begins to erase things on your soul the walls of your soul he begins to bleach them white from things that happen to you in the past or maybe you even did in the past it will be like you there's no way to remember it because it's gone and people when that begins to happen through things will happen they'll either run to God or run into the darkness and both of those things will happen but a lot of them will run after God they'll actually drag people out of home he's an ass and do you know who God is do you know him do you know him on the street do you know him do you know him do you know him do you know him I just felt him I need to know who he is it'll be happening everywhere even in churches your neighbors have been watching you knowing how you live your life maybe making fun of you or harassing you or something they won't be doing that when that happens they don't pound your door down until you answer it there's gonna be a hunger predators like never before since this earth was made to know the one who made them if you're young you have a powerful life ahead of you if you're not young ask to be timeless because he's into restoring you that means the way you look and the way you feel you have to declare you have to declare it you have to declare it I know that works the whole thing about whatever you say your words if you don't waste your words and a bunch of crazy stupid stuff but you make them very focused you've already learned one of the biggest secrets in the Bible you should have whatsoever you say he really means that if it's not for something you know just to spoil on yourself it's not just about you now being timeless is not just a view he wants you to be timeless how will restore your youth how many people have been saying that when I was young I was smart when I was young I would read stuff and then I actually believed it in the Bible I literally believed it and so I would act on it when I was young even though it was quiet out to people I was never quiet to God go in my room when I had a moment to myself at a dorm room with my four sisters at home I go out in the yard at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning cuz nobody was out there but the frogs lizards no alligators but a lot of other creatures were in Florida you got at night you're gonna find some don't worry the alligators don't walk around like dogs unless they've been trained to walk on a leash then maybe people do crazy stuff there I would just get along god I would start saying to his word to him your word says this okay I'm not participating with the change in my life when that thing comes it sounds like a curse to me you know when women go through the change I have seen women in my life goes I said that sounds like a curse I'm not I'm not under the curse I was just clearing I will not participate in any way whatsoever I'm gonna wake up in the morning it'll be done so when I turned 55 I went to sleep when I woke up I was done I didn't have one symptom not one single symptom of anything I was not participating with it so if you're young girls say it you don't have to participate okay to me that looked like a curse I wasn't going to have it I believed it and I said it and I reminded my god I've been born again I'm no longer under the curse I received nothing of the curse so I don't want age I started adding age I don't want to look old no matter how old I am I don't want to look codon won't ever be old I always want to be new every day and I'm not just fitting in that and I think I was like twelve when I said all that but at 55 all those years later when all my friends started having that I say I'm not participating are you participating are you planning are you literally planning for that why so 55 I went to bed one way I woke up done no hot flashes for me no other so I wasn't going to participate with it so say that about yourself right now no matter how don't expect your hearing to go don't expect your joints to hurt don't ever expect one day you'll need a cane to walk don't don't prepare for it and if you are reverse it I'm not preparing to be old [Applause] I'm expecting to get younger then you don't think like old people I don't know if I can get out of bed someone bring me my okay I'm not making funny I'm just saying that even society and the commercials if you love hallmark never listen to the commercials by the end of six months you'll have all the diseases they've been putting in you you'll have symptoms of them because you're filling your soul if I'm somewhere in my house I might turn that new to not participating I'm not gonna have that sickness that disease I'm not taking medicines that kill me faster than the diseases I'm not protect I'm yelling this at the top they can't wait to get a whole thing to miss that I don't want in here I'm not listening don't listen to it we just go on our life accepting and receiving because what you hear is going in your soul even you young people what you hear is going in here you get enough in there that's what you will become if you don't like you there is something in your soul get it out if people have been barred and been beating you up get all those words out cuz that's not who you are if you live in a family that bachelor's each other all the time loose all the words go outside and lose some of your soul and and you know put God in there instead go back in a different person in the past we didn't know what to do about it but what you can you just choose to do it amen be free and stay free this is a powerful time you have to understand you're a supernatural being [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we represent heaven but have we been living like it it's no wonder the world doesn't want him we have not been very good examples or witnesses have we and it doesn't matter where you live those people don't rule your life you still make choices release the anointing into every wall in your home in the floors your family be walking on sit on the furniture release the anointing then no one ain't brakes top you live with that it's in you first John 2:20 what is it where's the horse Rick it's the first John 2:27 yes yes when you become born again you get a deposit of anointing and it abides that means lives in you that anointing the anointing that Christ operated in that anointing that someone touched the hem of his garment and healed him the anointing that Peter and Paul uses so much there was a cloud of it around them you have it whatever you put it on it won't ever wash off or wear off go to your family home put it in the refrigerator handle I bet everybody touches that handle I do this we've had testimony from people who actually tested it in family members who were angry for 20 years got restored them because they had so much in the anointing of John they touch the refrigerator handle it would go up in them the anointing breaks the yoke at the workplace make sure you're using it okay I was still working in the world when I found out about this and I would sit and everybody's cheer after work in our break room I touched every table they didn't have cameras way back then they didn't have the money to put canvases that they didn't know I don't know what they would have thought about me everybody liked me in my job even the sinners I work for attorneys had 80 attorneys that's a lot of people in that building I had great favor with them they would not swear around me they just they wouldn't know what to say sometimes because that was their normal length but you know talking about languages that was their normal language when I came around I just didn't say anything they just take their head and wave didn't want to swear I would really see no we had so many people get saved in that company cuz the anointing was on everything it was in the floors and the walls I was gonna make sure I coated it you don't ever run out your favorite restaurant make sure you leave it in the tables you know drop something and touch the floor you can wash your hand later because it literally comes out of you I got a real creative eye I put it on the wheels in my car and the anointing is like fire if you can see it it looks like fire so when I Drive fire tracks everywhere I go people cross over them they drive over them you know when he goes up inside their car it gets on them see you can be creative you give me do covert operations till he throws you out there you know I'm because the more you use it the more powerful it becomes it does something else it burns the demons like you put a flame torch on you that's what it does to them they don't like that fire that's God's fire so how about that run them out of your neighborhood oh yeah Jen like Glen you see when you see stuff there's residue left by other people who are really looking they leave a residue of the enemy and so we see that when we go places before I sit down anywhere now I will touch that seat and I'll say I'll cleanse it for the kingdom and then the fire of God does this and removes it in hotel rooms oh my hotel is in my favorite place you know what I do it's 3:00 in the morning I walk down the hall in touch every door now I know they have cameras I don't what they think but I'm not doing anything harmful when I check in I let them know I pray you may see me in the hallways I'm just praying for a big never oh well that's lovely thank you for giving me permission because I released it before I get in the hotel I send the host to drive every demon out of every hotel I'm not tolerating him around me and I see them running out okay I see the host going there and literally running them out then I released the life of God into the hotel even into the whole place you know how people sometimes don't treat you nice we always get treated nice because they're actually beginning to bask in the anointing that's covering the entire counter that they are touching as they register me I do get upgrades I put it in the planes I put it in every Airport I'm not gonna waste my life just walking around breathing everywhere you go you can do something people said I like to pierce a demon we release the anointing you physically is a physical person cannot attack a demon just in case you ever wondered there are spiritual beings but you have spiritual weapons in you there can be leashed upon them I'll go by places that I know you know places of ill repute that's the nicest way to say it I will send the anointing in there like fire and I can see through the walls I see the demons streaming as it hits them they begin to scream and ride then they're burning in this fire from God the place gets extremely boring because there's nothing in there to and you know empower sin or whatever's going on my one sister not Jen I say that I have a sister who was kidnapped and dragged away when she was young we prayed her we finally got her back years later and and she didn't trust anybody but but right now limite she's a firehouse she is on fire for God she is she is so destroying places of darkness you know that demonic and everything she's also a seer and in her life there's time in her life but she would dance in clubs and she knew every time I drove by seriously would tell me this she said you know I know you drove by earlier today didn't you why yes I did she said the men fell asleep on the counters [Laughter] and she would stand there dancing and she look at the paper we may as well go home my sister just override she's released to fire God in here and every demon is left my family's very real wasn't so God did something even better than at a time when we didn't have a place he moved me in with her her places one of the place that I slept on the floor there was so much anointing you would float in it when he came in the door and she finally came in one day literally threw her stuff her bags and I'm giving up I cannot do this anymore I come home there's anointing I'm gonna work you've release the anointing it's in the clothes I'm wearing it's in my closet it's in my bag I'm carrying I'm just gonna have to leave and she quit so if God has moved you in family there is a reason please release it so no one can tell me this doesn't work you can't tell me it's too late she would literally call me this place is dead and we actually did shut a place down literally it was one of the biggest clubs and I kept declaring that it would be taken to the ground there wouldn't be a brick left because it sucked up the lives of young girls who my sister would win to the Lord while she was in that club and she told me you don't have to live like this I know Jesus Christ is this crazy she's running from him but she said I know I can help you you can quit God can give you a life I know you have children I know you hate this they usually do most all of them heat it and she says so I'm gonna go pray with you back here i'ma lay hands on Jesus crazy she said I know I still have anointing it's been really dormant but I'm gonna pray for you to receive Jesus Christ and if you do this I will promise you she'll find a better job and every single time it worked for her every time these girls want to be mentored by her but she wasn't even serving god she said no I'll show you a place you can go and go and get fed spiritually and she said I know one day I'll have to give up what God finally got tired of waiting on him so he moved me in the anointing breaks the yoke and you can't deny you have it there is a scripture that talks about it and if I say these words the anointing does what everyone in the room knows it breaks the yoke well that's the anointing that's in first John 2:27 did you get a deposit off when you received Christ how long ago was that it's been sitting in you waiting for you to let it out the more you let it out it will come outside your whole being it can't even be contained inside it will be outside you and sometimes listen to this if I want you I could fill the whole room with mine cuz so many years every day of my life I loose it I feel it leaving me when that woman touched the hem of His garment in me to demand on that what did Christ say he felt it leaving him that was power that was the anointing that totally healed that woman totally after years it races people from the dead it drives demons out of people it heals people in this world because in that world that's how they used it in this world think send it over the internet through every single phone call it will go and if you don't do it guess what it's not gonna happen just do it it's in the Bible it was used in the Bible it didn't go away God's never changed that I teach children to do it so by the time they're 30 they could probably feel like a whole city block if not more by your presence someday someone will walk through a hospital when every person has healed because you're walking down the hall not even touching them it will be the anointing that you carry every missionary team should be training their people wherever they go to release the anointing okay there you go there's where that there's that that's the anointing the anointing you haven't deposited up it's a deposit because when you put it out you get more the more you give out the more deposits the more you never stop never stop I get mine I get I get refilled all day long every single day I get more and I release it in the entire buildings I don't want the enemy bad I wasn't born to live with him and I'm never tolerating him in my presence if you remember the bodies of the Christ lived like this what would this world look like by one simple thing not even all the rest it's available just by one little simple thing yes you could prove as in the Word of God they're scripture to back it up you have to be willing well you have to even know first because this is not always taught in church every new Christian should be taught about the anointing every single one should know you are powerful you are dangerous you have weapons against hell built-in you put in you from the day you receive Jesus Christ and no one can say I don't want that they don't even have to know you've used it it is a secret weapon unless people need it and then they come and ask when you lay hands on them always always always release the anointing always every time you shake a hand say in your spirit every DS it's a spiritual weapon come here come up here I'm gonna show you when you meet somebody somebody goes you go I'm gonna say it out loud bits with you and she says hi and ago hi how are you doing the whole time I can feel it going on in my arm into her arm so you don't even have to tell people use the anointing people if you don't even want to know the the deeper higher stuff that maybe boggles your mind sometimes if you were in heaven some of the stuff you saw would do that to your head if you saw some of the army of heaven you'd really you probably fall under chairs they're fierce they have Spears coming out of the entire body they go into the camp an enemy and they spin and shred their name is shredder they're my friends in heaven you will have angels as friends it won't be weird they've always been there they've always been made by God having a friend is not worshiping they have assignments they're very focused on their assignment on this earth at this time because evil is still here what did you think they were gonna do one day what are they gonna do sticking a little group somewhere in a cloud when the devil's not here seriously think about things like that in your head sometimes they have personalities they're exciting they like things they have things they like that things they don't like they have opinions about you now if they're your guardian angel they always think you're perfect and amazing they sometimes get frustrated they go home for R&R that's why you need more than one and we laugh but this is truth [Music] here our supernatural being carrying their light of God and the glory is wrapped around you and you're living with humans they have conversations we're gonna have a sitcom one day about guardian angels it will be a comedy and God is perfectly okay with that sometimes it is comic comical for them but when you do something when you do something that is against the enemy when you stand up for what is right they get ecstatic they will yell they will run you know that whole thing about getting inside you running around the house while when you're by yourself they do that because they've been waiting yeah [Applause] in those two running oh god did you see that did you hear what they said [Applause] they've been with you like forever when day you'll ride the rush in heaven with them that's a rollercoaster so yes they will have kind of new lives at one point because there's no more evil you know especially the host I think Gabriel's group is more probable used to just connecting and giving messages and stuff but the hosts all they do is fight they fight the war they fight the war they fight the war they fight the war they fight their war they fight their war they fight they war that's what they do so one day they won't have that they're gonna have fun that's what they're gonna do they'll probably escort us to new planets to explore new planets so good to do exciting things what they'll do and we'll know them right now we need to know God right that's what they want us to do but one day their life will be different and I know we're down here most people in like natural people not were the understanding how things operate they God made them now he made them first but we existed before they did I love these revelations before he made the angels we existed in God that thing about him being from the beginning to the end and the beginning you were in him you saw all that 90 verse 1 through 2 you were with him so he made this statement to me one day because I talked a lot about the angels because I know a lot about them and God said yes they've been with me for a long time I made them a very long time ago in tribes they're all made in tribes the army Gabriel's Lucifer heads and ones he was over so they're not there anymore but there's still some that do worship the Seraphim they still have some that sing in heaven but we actually replace all the worship angels that's why we worship that's why they don't want you to worship the ones the fallen ones they were worship angels who literally would go before the throne of God and worship Him and they chose the one who was their leader who was accreted being over him that's why they cannot repent like they can't repent amen but we existed we always were in him we didn't just appear it's not all of a sudden guy said I want to make billions of little spiritual beings and one day I'll send to the earth they were always we were always in him when there was just Melchizedek and the living creatures and the word and the Holy Spirit before he started making stuff we were there living in and out riding on the rainbow that's where you were everyone who ever existed it came from him eternity is in him that's why he can take you anywhere that's your dad amen so stand up for a minute we're gonna declare something stuff in them god I thank you that your children are here today to hear about you to hear about your plans for them to find out who they are god I pray not one word drops to the ground that was spoken to them God that you will not let it leave their being but they will hear it and hear it over and over and over and over God that they will be empowered and it will be inspired and they will be set on fire to pursue you and your son even more that they will know the Holy Spirit like their best friend because he wants to be thank you god you made a special if we were made in your image than we are special if we're to operate just like you operate that makes this even more special put a burning desire in all of their hearts God to be just like you that was the whole point of Christ donning so he could duplicate himself we are not we will never be God but we are the sons and daughters of God we were loaned to our parents no matter what they were like whether you loved him or didn't want to be with him you were loaned cuz we go home we're all brothers and sisters in the Lord he is your father he is the one you came from he made you in His image people go isn't he just a spirit he has a head he has a body or you would not have one he has arms his legs or you wouldn't have any he doesn't look strange he makes strange things makes a lot of strange creatures in heaven but we don't look strange but we're supposed to live that way Christel live just like him he spoke where there was nothing and then there was he puts power in our words he writes things on our soul before he sends us his hope is that you will come back so don't stop praying for your own safe Amalie your unsaved friends those that work don't stop praying for them declare they will know him love him serve him that you will be together in eternity they will not miss their destiny no matter how they act or talk we want them free amen God wants more in heaven than in hell people always talk about how many are going to hell I have news for you I don't think they'll ever be more in Hell than in him because he has a purpose and God I I declare that they will know their purpose they will run after that purpose it will be powerful in this life and receive great reward now and in the life to come not just in heaven God let them have a great harvest of finances in restoration and love and joy and happiness in this life God that they can demonstrate your image and your character the people in this earth that heaven is not boring God is not boring yes he does love you he does care but he is so holy to even think that when you go home to heaven you had the right to step inside of him that's because he's got and you are his child and he does purpose that Jesus said father you and me and me and you I pray that they will be one even as we are one and he was talking about when you come home to heaven you will step inside the Father Christ will step inside the Father Holy Spirit will step inside the Father and that is one we won't be the three and want to be the foreign one because that is where you came from heaven is like home because that's where he is amen you were born to be great don't let the enemy lie to you she's right he's the father of liars his language is lying so god I thank you for this time together father I I pray that they be empowered that their lives changed forever they will burn with your fire in your love everywhere they go remind them Holy Spirit to release the anointing all the time they can do damage to hell's plans and break yokes off of people because they carry the anointing that your son not just anybody but what your son walked in when they get bored again they get a measure and a deposit of the anointing he walked in they get light from you they get a stone of fire put in their spirit man that brings in light and the more they obey and the more they love that light will become so brilliant they will look like an inferno one day thank you God for truth and life to be and everybody here and if they're not married when they get married let be in their marriage let it be in their children and the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren and then the generations let it build father until you says it's over it's not over so father thank you for tooth in life and celebration today it is a way of life in heaven no sadness no sickness no disease no handicaps no age no jealousy no coveting no arguing however you will share your mind with some people you do not become a robot you become more you than you ever were before your gift will increase in every way people will love you they will love your gift they'll enjoy what God put in you and haven't you get to enjoy everything that they carry and that they did that they'll do in heaven heaven is an exciting place this is a vapor of time and I'm just gonna say when he sends the last one from himself he will no longer need time and time will be no more the end of time is not a date it is an event there you go yes sir there's a free revelation for you that is why he is the only one they can say when it's over you got it we'll have a blessed day amen [Applause] [Music]

or https://youtu.be/qVZFUEoHuHw
welcome everyone I'm excited about this night how about you how many people were not here last night can I see your hands wow I'm so glad you made it amen how many people this is the first time you've heard me speak how many have heard me on YouTube but not in person how many people never heard me speak before thank you Jesus help them all I was never made to be normal I'm one of 15 I'm number three that means that was a mother at a Jay stop as a helper if you never were part of a big family a tribe you don't understand that if you were you know exactly what I'm talking about you pretty much never had a life that was your life you learned at a young age to surrender you learned how to be in charge you know how to to break up fights to bring peace be adventurous and exciting with the things you have them do to keep them busy so they weren't fighting how to feed that many people how to make that much food i watch that many dishes 150 every day peel 50 pounds of potato once a week eight loads of laundry a day I think we did like 60 a week I helped with all of it and so I learned at early age to hear God for help my baby sister sitting on the front row is number 15 I was like a second mom to her so we grew up knowing each other really well she lives with me has lived with me since 1999 and so has my mom because my dad decided to go home to heaven he's having a wonderful time up there on his ranch with all of our pets it's too late to tell me they don't go there it's the father's choice man there's some things only he decides and if he decides to do who's gonna argue it's too late they're there I recognize many of my pets I had him when I was like 7 you know much before that not a lot but ever since that time although all the pets I've ever had I've recognized all of them and many of my siblings pets they had our brother Joey's duck named Max when he was 9 my brother's alligator named Charlie that lived in our bathtub until it was bath time my brother's iguana lizard named Iggy they've done to the downstairs closet which was also our phone booth you know in the 50s and 60s you had one phone with one line and it was hooked to the wall and sometimes it was a party line that doesn't mean it was a party means you shared everybody's conversation with whoever they were talking to you until they were done unless you could convince them you really needed the phone so I grew up in the time in the era before microwaves at the very beginning of television when you had a round screen it was black and white and had five shows not a lot to watch right we had a big old house we had a big yard and all of our friends wanted to come and visit us so that means we had probably had 30 around 30 all the time in our yard and so we learned how to get along with the rest of the world just because we had to grow up together and my father knew God well the father and the son in the Holy Spirit very well so did his mother some seventh generation of knowing odd living for him loving for him and I love everyone no matter the mistakes you make even what you believe I know where you came from you came from him he had plans for everyone not everyone chose his plans many people don't even know him but he wants to know them so I have a lot of Grace and I have unending patience long-suffering and patience in my life so I can put up with just about anything all the time and God needed me to be that way if I was going to share his home to people all over the world no matter what I would have thought about them I changed I changed several times in my life I got more and more like God because there was supposed to be just like him I actually began to say that there was nothing else to do except say it so I used to stand and say God I want to be just like you now if you loved your father would you say that about him my brothers used to say that about my earthly father I'm gonna be just like you dad I said that about my Heavenly Father I wanna be just like you I'm gonna talk like you I want to act like you want people to see you when they see me I want them to hear you when they hear me and I want to crush darkness and so one day I was just minding my own business which is God's business I was speaking in a church I also speak in many other places anyone who wants to hear about heaven Ellen bite me they have to get past the pink hair whoever knew that that would be a stumbling block right I've been the same and the same as far as my relationship with God since I was age 4 that's a very long time 62 years I've known Jesus Christ personally and so you know I knew he was watching my life all the time I mean he does live in us right he's not blind but he still loves us he has hope for us and he has a lot of hope for us because Christ in us is the hope of so if he lives in you you're not going to escape carrying it and that means one day you'll shine like the stars in the heavens because the word says so so before the one day I was going to tell you about there was another time I was in another city and I think we're out in fairgrounds or something I don't remember we had to go to ladies room there were no lights all the lights had blown out and that was a problem so I went in there to see what was going on when I walked in the door it was this long big room and it was dark until I opened the door and then it was light so I started looking for the light I'm literally looking where's the light coming from I'm not kidding about any of this and where's the light coming from none of the lights are on but everywhere I looked there was light until I looked in the mirror it was coming from me I was stunned but it was it was it was overwhelming to me that I was seeing the word alive in me but when you begin to declare things about God or for God those things are gonna start happening in your life and I would tell people all the time one day you shine like the stars in the heavens because he does let me tell you he shines I'm done my Jesus Christ he's got so much glory coming from you he can dim that glory if he wants to but I've seen him full-out glory like a million diamonds and I used to be so undone whenever I would see him and so I'm a little steam is still staying in the ladies bathroom when there's no light anywhere except coming from me and what this is crazy so I still thought well I know I can see it in the mirror but let's look at all the stalls so I opened every dough every door and there was darkness till I went in then it was light and I walked up and down then it was fun I went up and down everywhere in there and it was light everywhere and I thought if somebody needs to come in here now why the lights by the lights shining right now you can see whatever you need to do and so these were just like I would call them random encounters or instances that happened to me most of my life but that was one that really surprised even me and I heard the Lord say did I not say you would shine like the stars in the heavens that even the night would be light round about you and he was just saying the word to me and he was confirming the word and so if you're faithful to him he's gonna be faithful to you and I know everyone's been through hard times or they have issues in their life or things that they're facing that might not be easy remember who he is and remember who you are okay if you begin to remember who you are according to the word you change the way you look at everything and sometimes nothing seems impossible I've been in a lot of impossible places in my life and it never touched me I made a decision I'm not changing according to circumstances or what people think of what people say oh it is actually happening I don't know what any of it affects me because my hope is in him my eternity is in him no man holds my eternity in their hands it's in his hands and I told people one time when we had absolutely nothing and slept on people's floors that wasn't to teach us something that was to show other something that no matter where you are you can carry the glory you can shift things change things by the decisions you make and the choices you make every day of your life it doesn't stop you from ruling and reigning from Christ it doesn't take away your authority and I told somebody one time they're saying well how are you holding up I want what I'm up what am i holding up what are you talking about well you know all the things you're going through and I'm not going to do anything I'm living my life for Christ's no matter what's going on I will move things I will not let things move me now I begin to declare the goodness of God over my life over my family's life because I knew this was a very short thing in my life I knew it wasn't the devil how about that one it was God showing people that you can live powerfully no matter what's going on around you about the decisions you choose it can change things I didn't change anything I did about my church I still served I helped what I had I would give I love people anyway I was rejoicing every day of my life I chose to be happy and we were saying with the front sweeping on their floors and it was my daughter's a fifth birthday and you know what she was happy about anything could because she had lived for the hottest we trained our children to know God Himself to know who he is what his plans are for us and she just all she wanted was a little baby doll carriage and a baby doll and we couldn't get any of that at the time because things had but something had been taken from us it wasn't us doing it we didn't even curse the person and so there was a sound outside the front door she was awake she ran to the front door and outside was a brand-new with a big bow on it the most beautiful baby doll cares I've seen in my life and the most beautiful baby I've seen full of accessories in this beautiful carriage from someone who knew nothing about what was going on and she ran out saying look my present has arrived the Angels brought us and and so we celebrated her birthday it was awesome the next year before the next year ended someone walked up doesn't said here take this and live here free for a year it was a million dollar condo out at one of the most exclusive places in our city at the beach [Music] we didn't call this person we didn't tell them anything we lived the same way every day if we don't even living in that place because we trusted God we knew he held our future in his hands and I refused to let the enemy have any fun no I tormented him the entire time because all I ever did was have a good report I had a god report of what God was saying about us amen so no matter what it looks like start worshiping him declaring who he is who holds your future in his hand amen because we're entering into powerful times on this earth I've been talking about this for a while but things are literally starting to happen that I said even 12 years ago literally happening exactly the way God told me they would happen and I'm here especially to do two things I'm gonna talk about Trump I hope you like him I hope you realize God does not always choose the one we think is better he chooses the one who is the best for what he needs even my own mom and she was here she came up and give her a test my mom is a hoot she's a be something I forget how old she is all the time she calls people who are 69 old but she never includes herself she travels all over the world with me on no medication she has no help to do anything she's planning to live to be 120 unless God once or longer she'd like to see my dad before them but she understands he's having a good time so she's okay with that but she's very political and has been most of her life because she knows what is right and what is wrong and she has a plumb switch to prove it if you'd ever watch any my when I campaigned this whole last term before Trump was elected I had a lot of Trump reports and my mom wanted to be in as many she could on my facebook she gave her own thoughts and opinions on everything most of the time she had her plumb switch with her people said we need your mom my mom did speak her mind but it was along the lines of what God believed and purpose she knew what life was she knew what death was she didn't have a problem discerning them or telling anyone which one to choose she hasn't changed and she's still my mom even though I'm in my 60s Jen's in her 40s our mom is still our mom and I can probably hear her when she goes to heaven one day giving me her opinions on things she loves this place she loves Pastor Dave and Dee Dee so much she's getting ready for her next month when we go on our british isles cruise she's going to get to for the very first time visit the land of her earthly ancestors which is the irish she's a good example of an irish look I'll tell you why and she's expecting to have a lot of fun amen so she's getting on her treadmill getting in shape picking out her she already got her suitcase packed I think and so she has a lot of fun when she go she will meet a hundred new people who haul them all her friends so she still enjoys her life she starts her own prayer line yeah if people want children if they if they're in a place where they can have babies gate not saying if you can have or not I'm saying if you want them and you're married you're gonna have one if she prays for you we have had other evidence of here right here in this church she pray for them I think it was like nine months later their daughter had a baby and so my mom is serious that she'll start a prayer line at meetings who would like to have babies you must be married because that is coming first and she'll pray for him in every one of them as far as we know every one of them has had a baby that she prayed for him I mean she will she'll make sure you understand what it means to have one cuz if anybody knows it would be her what's gonna happen as the baby gets older this is what you can expect don't be shocked when this happens or this happens it's all gonna be okay all this stuff is normal you just give your life away for about ten years and so she's a lot of fun but my mom put a lot on me my dad put a tremendous amount my mom put a lot of the practical logical things that we need to know how to treat people how to be polite how to be a young lady cuz you never know who you're gonna make sure you always have clean underwear that was always on the list every single day I always do what Jen always wear your seat belt or if you're in the car with her she will put it on you herself and so she does not want people to break the law and she reminds us of it 24 hours a day even if we're not even in other countries I'm down you she's really on top of things so she's a lot of fun my dad was the most amazing person I knew on the earth and I love to talk about him but tonight he wants me to talk about Trump in heaven they're rooting for him I don't know what earth people think about heaven knows that God picked him and what he's already done for this country proves that God picked him amen and he's going to win in 2020 in case you wonder write it down write it down it's going to have and he's only through like two years and he's already created five million jobs if you didn't know I know all the stats I have friends who are part of the Trump administration um I don't know him yet but I will God said I would and I'm you know when whenever that happens is good with me but he's got a lot of things planned he hasn't even talked about yet I'm talking about the president I did just come from the Trump 2020 announcement rally in Orlando Florida it was so deafening you could hardly hear anything from the people they had a hundred thousand tickets but the place only held 20-some thousand people so everybody else was outside they had Jumbotron set up and this is the honest truth no matter what you've heard on the news there were 35 hecklers thirty-five against to the tens of thousands which which came to cheer him on and thank him for what he has done and the thing about the hecklers because I made sure I was outside most of the time on purpose this time I was over there by them releasing the anointing into every one of them they needed help if I was going to be one of them I would have set up my stand I would have given our plan I literally would have said this is our plan for the Democratic Party this is what we got planned it's going to be great they didn't do that all they could do was swear at Trump and swear it people it was really sad so I was praying all the time releasing the anointing sending the host upholding on the demonic off of them I mean I was over here having a prayer warrior time they couldn't scream over the sound of the the jumbo screens they couldn't because I was on the corner like right here's the massive Amway Center that was deafening was like a wave would come from here from the jumbotron that wave would come from here and I was being hit by both waves and I didn't want to make some statements because I'm a seer that means I see the spirit or I'm not like I see everybody's angels here everybody say Thank You angel for putting up with me loving me and watching over me making work as much well I have to tell you what exciting points of me being there and I literally just came from Hollywood from being there for seven days night and day I'm gonna be part of giving content I was sharing this last night I literally um what I said seven years ago what God has said to me I said it happened this last week in Hollywood they're starting up my contract to give spiritual realm content for the resurrection of Jesus Christ movie that's being made in Hollywood in Hollywood so you're gonna see the truth on the screen to the entire movie like Colossians where Christ spoiled and messed up the principalities and powers in the midst of hell ruined their very village forever stripped all the royal robes off of Satan and took the gemstones everyone that God put on him according to Ezekiel 28 you will see him pluck them off one at a time in the movie leaving only the mountings that held them you'll see him take the keys of hell death in the grave why the rush to the all of the hell that was present to watch this show it was a show clearly the word said Christ made a show of it openly so he had a show in hell wasting hell in front of all of Hell okay and you will see that in every detail I can't tell you much more than that but I promise you you will see that in detail while people send up all of a theater and scream for Jesus Christ you'll see the depths of Hell where it took place and the Bible says all through the Bible as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days so we'll be in the earth God had a plan no matter what anyone thought he had a plan when he sent his son and on the day he died which is actually in the garden when he drank the cup you will also see what he drank it won't be a thought in your mind anymore because he died in the garden he died to his own will he said so if it's possible father take this cup from me because he saw what he knew what was in that cup evil the most worst evil ever into his perfectly pure body walking as a man righteous righteous righteous with no sin asked to take that that is what had to be nailed to the cross not just his body that had to go in this perfect body every sin that could be committed had to be nailed to the cross he is the only one who can forgive because he's the only one that drank that cup no one took that inside of themselves and but was nailed to the cross it was what was in him that he had to drink in that garden it was God's will and he couldn't even look upon his son he couldn't hear his father for that time he sets them on the cross so this would be the most different movie you'll ever see in your life it will introduce the spirit realm to all of Hollywood in the whole world [Applause] so yes I am excited because God is taking Hollywood amen you'll see many changes in some of the worst places in our country here because God has always planned to have them for himself Satan has been ruling in these places for a long time so he's very much afraid I will not use the word angry there's a difference in angry and terrified he Satan is terrified he can't stop it cuz Godin has somebody who's never gonna say no who is not afraid of what the enemy might do the enemy is afraid of what I might do does the word say that if you submit yourself under the hand of God you know resisters I mean oh no I'm not taking you I will not tolerate anything you're offering me I'm gonna serve you I serve the Most High God of heaven earth I just polish you I'll never surrender you don't waste your time get out [Applause] well that is how we're supposed to live that as a manifested daughter of God manifesting his power his plans his love his ways his will by the way they live it's not something you do every now and then it is a lifestyle and they're people and God made me take years to get to this point so people would know who I am and what I stand for and even how I live it would be hard for someone to try to bash me because most people wouldn't believe it someone sees me the first time I don't believe you I think you lied about everything why don't you go ask God you cannot hear him because you should if you belong to him the word says you not hear the voice of another if you want truth go ask him and pursue him until you hear it do you give up in two weeks how can you give you something that's gonna take 50 years because some things I've been waiting 50 years for and I will still get it because I'm not giving up and I'm not gonna step back I'll have whatever he wants to give me and you should be saying the same thing so Hollywood is going to be wrecked by the Most High God by the hosts of heaven I've been bombarding Hollywood since I left they're sending in sweeps of that place ten billion hosts of heaven to pull down every stronghold of Satan every realm any high level being has been ruling from there being shredded the ones that can't will have their mouth shut while I'm there because I don't have to tolerate them God didn't did he his son didn't did he are we supposed to be just like them we made in their image and after their likeness which means the way they operate were supposed to operate so when the body finally gets that message and they wake up stand up and stand out you'll see many powerful changes and shifts happens in this world there are 10 year-olds right now commanding an army of the hosts of heaven and they've been doing it for three years they wreak havoc on hell the enemy runs from them this is who we are we're not weak little humans we may live in this world but you are not you are an alien you're from another world and God is serious about us living on earth as they live in heaven so this time for America is a great time it will set things up for many years to come 24 years of God in the White House will happen [Music] [Applause] so you can expect Trump to win in 2020 and then pence win for the next eight years after that and whoever pence picks his vice-president will be president for eight years eight years after that twenty four years in the White House maybe the Democrats should take a long vacation and wait it out I'm trying to help them it is sound advice you can only talk like this if you've seen God face to face and he told you that except he doesn't just tell me he shows me when Trump said he was winning God showed me took me in Fisher and showed me Trump sitting in the White House when there's still 17 people in the Republican group running against him God said I will eliminate them one by one they'll be forced to take him because even the leaders didn't want him because they couldn't control him they couldn't scare him they couldn't buy him God picked the right person so I know I don't know who Pence is going to pick but they will seriously consider it they've already heard me declare all this on the inaugural prayer breakfast when they let me do the prayer or Trump and pence I prophesied so I'm looking forward to these years in my life don't miss them don't sit on a rock somewhere and just watch it go by be a part of it because once you step out and start doing something it just accelerates your faith explodes when you begin to see God do things quickly because we're in a time of acceleration it will be quickly we still have years left I don't always tell how many years left I don't know the date in time I know the event like at one point there'll be I'm talking about when there's no more time on the earth I'm not talking about just the millennial reign time not past that because it's during them alone and ring you know that's a thousand years right how many people know that been to Israel been to the temple I know that Christ will sit on a throne for 1,000 years in that place when no one is destroying Israel if you've wondered about that don't be concerned about it keep praying for them God is blessing them the desert is blooming like it never has before I was there five years ago it was all desert when I came this time because I was also there for like I forgot how many days it seemed like eternity I didn't get to speak in a nice hotel I actually had viewed the pilgrim his tour where you went to Masada and every place Jesus went then other you know Elijah you know I'm not Carmel I was there I was in the garden tomb where the two angels who rolled the stone away are still there I stood in the garden flower bed where Christ did that's why Mary thought he was the gardener he likes flowers I've been in the upper room I spoke on the Sea of Galilee I was in Shiloh where Joshua led the people into the Promised Land that's where they first settled I was there I saw every spiritual spirit round the thing that had been opened by all these mighty men and women of God and I think the thing that moved me the most was you could hold a Bible and stand not quite but it seemed I can see from one end Israel to the other it's not very big but everything in the Bible happened in that small area and they have kept those places they've kept them and they like Americans but Israel loves Trump they love him because in the short amount of time what he was able to do for that country that's never been done before it was actually promised by many presidents in our country but they never did it he did it and they all loved him it doesn't matter how old they are doesn't matter if they're Orthodox or you know messianic or secular Jews it doesn't matter they all love him because he's made their country safer he's finally announced it is literally a real country amen it had the right to that land they got the Golan Heights back you've got to go everywhere in this country because Americans are welcome by anybody a general matter if it's Palestinians it doesn't matter who it is Syrians if they live in that country they kind of separate up the land is real smart they don't have as much war because they sat down and talked to these people well they own all the land the Palestinians aren't but they made an agreement we'll let you live there but you'll pay taxes instead of having awards that will keep fighting what we all live our lives so they don't go in their area without permission but everybody gets along and so all these different sections I think is like ABC cently they came up with a plan I was amazed at the plan but but the American tourists can go to any part of Israel they want to because those people know they're gonna make money so they welcome tourists all the time it's like they won't let an Israeli bus driver go into one area but they'll let a bus driver from that area pick up the Americans and bring them in that area and so that's why there's not as much war also the threat that Trump said if you attack them you're attacking me in my country I think that helps a little bit God purpose for them to be friends and this is a season of destiny for Israel it's a season of destiny for Korea for England amen of course for America and Hollywood for priority things got his pinpointed to start something between 2018 and then the 2019 major things would happen in each one of those places it was set of course for their destiny and God made sure I got to go to each one of those places and declare something for him and Korea was the first one at the end of the right at the end of the games I was invited to speak to a university isn't that amazing with my twelfth grade education see my graduation certificate they wanted me to come teaching about heaven and give college credits for it and they all did very well that was quite interesting I lost 12 pounds because I don't like fish guess what they ate every day of their life I had pretzels Brazil nuts and oranges that's what I ate for 12 days and in Israel it was almost the same I didn't like their food either guess what they eat a lot of fish the whole hotel smelled like fish so I ate like tomatoes a roll I again had some kind of nuts I think it was almonds or something I ate almonds and every now and then I have some little dessert thing that was about it so I lost 12 pounds there also if you go to Israel make sure you're in pretty good shape because you will climb up everything steps made out of stone steps that go forever and then you're gonna come back down there's no trolley car to take down okay you walk up these steps down these steps up these mountains down these mountains sometimes inside the mountains but you walk you're gonna walk those people walk no wonder they're all in good shape don't ride a camel don't walk by mine either my heart went out to the wise men as they crossed the desert for to hurt each with a bunch of camels it wasn't three camels with three why's my whole life I thought while they had a long journey together there must have got each other know each other really well right it's just a three of them no they each had lines of camels and they carried their tents their food their food for the camels their water their servants their homes they carried everything with the smelly camels and thinking I have a whole new view of being on that camera so some of it was funny most of it was very powerful as I got to meet some really amazing Jewish people they took us into the Jewish quarter we had a really great tour guide his name is Yoshi if you ever plan to go there look him up they call him the unofficial mayor of tourism he also he's in his 70s he's been I forgot three different digs actually where the unearthed stuff and everything he knows a lot about that takes you into the old Roman places before Christ was even born and you see a lot learn a lot but the thing that you never get over is the presence of God there and you're so impacted by you realize how they live their lives and yet they have survived survived survived and they have outlived all of their enemies which they are very pleased with and they'll always make the statement no matter what went on they're gone and we are still here so God does have amazing plans he really does have priority list he's working on and he's going to complete his priority list it's important to pray always pray never stop praying make sure you declare and decree also it is a high level of praying and when we pray many times we're asking which is good because you don't have it right if you don't ask you have not because you ask not asking comes in a form of the prayer reviews to be been doing on most of our lives declaring and occurring is another level of Prayer where you have so much faith in you you know what you say is going to happen because you know the word what the word says and your faith grows as you step out and believe and trust God more and do things you you become soulful of God and you understand the word come so alive to you because you're living it you're not just reading you're living it and so God does have a timeline in heaven I was shown that timeline up into heaven so many times I lost count I stopped counting but I remember every time I've been he has a timeline behind his throne and I've seen part of that timeline and there's still a lot left that hasn't happened and every one of those things I saw was not like a date it wasn't like March 2nd 2019 it was the name of the event that was going to take place and there's still things we haven't done that the word talks about so I know there are people literally writing books and sharing from their platform it's called all gonna end well they've been saying that a long time the Mayans lost out they had their last chance they're all dead and gone and we're still here so the Mayans timeline that's gone that was actually written down and people said well we don't have much time left I want I'll still be here and it'll all be gone I'm not going anywhere yeah and so God has his timeline and there are events we're living in one of those events right now that he calls the kingdom age and in this timeframe of this kingdom age which is several generations of time it is it is going to not end into the Millennial age starts amen or right before the Millennial age possibly I don't know when that's going to end or happen either I just know it's not for right now the perros times are not for right now this is the day of his power or not the day of his wrath the most important thing you can learn about God is what time is it that's why the tribe of Judah wouldn't do anything without consulting the tribe of Issachar who knew the times and seasons of God how to operate in it what you needed to operate in it what you needed to do to be successful in it and the manifested sons and daughters will operate just like the tribe of Issachar in this time they will know what time it is on God's timeline and how to live the way you need to to be successful so living on earth as it doesn't happen is very important to know that and to actually live it to believe in God let your faith explode in him be prepared to celebrate not to escape forget escaping I love it I love it the father says you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape being great that's what he thinks about this time it's a time to be great for him great with him amen even you don't understand anything I'm saying trust me it's not over how about that one so roll of your rapture rug don't worry about escaping because the rapture won't be an escape it will be a celebration so even that's not going to be what most people think we have to escape we have to we have to escape the mark of the beast I don't think he's on the earth yet you know why he won't be able to do much because in this time we get stronger and greater with God we manifest the power of the Living God and do you think so shocking that it will stun he'll push darkness back and shift this world and change things the enterprise couldn't be here it says clear in the world until he that is withheld is removed the Antichrist cannot appear and we're just finding out who we are so forget about the rest of stuff that is in the father's hands jesus said to occupy until he comes back not high we also get to put the third show on God put the first one on kicking Satan out of heaven with all of his fallen angels who were angry and bitter at their newfound leader who lied to them the first thing he said to him was a lie everything after that has been a lie he even lied them when Christ's went into hell remember because he had to he was telling he's gonna wipe up hell with him get ready we're gonna have a show oh I'm putting on the biggest show he said well wipe him up and people are gonna know fine you once and for all I have more power I have more authority this is my heir my area my realm my role here and no one's going to come in here and tell me what to do and yet he beat him up how many people saw the Avengers and saw the Hulk take Loki Beibei Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam pretty much that's what's gonna happen in the movie I love what Jeff says Iron Man shows up first in Jesus this is not this is a this is a fictional account okay taking some license in this because Jesus did melt the faces of the principalities they melted like laughs so there's an Iron Man to the leader of all these that he had taken so much time to call in because principalities don't sit in hell if you understood how hell operated you would understand how much that scripture what that means in that scripture when it says the principalities and powers he wasted them and spoiled them well they wouldn't even be in Hell normally they rule on Thrones around this world because Satan was gonna have a big show he called them all in all that word went everywhere call him in call him in I want him to watch put him on the front row at the gates of Hell right inside the court yard they're gonna see me man all stoked I'm a book at my royal robes on no he's no shine his stones that at that time he still had I got a shine on so they you know they glow let me fell because of his duty he's about to lose it all he had the keys I'm in charge of death this was him he actually said these words he bragged about it on purpose so here comes all the hierarchy all the little demons have to be way in the back screaming and complaining whining why they'd be guys coming here they all hate each other by the way there's no love and Satan's care so he's gonna have a good show and all this time Christ is saying nothing just waiting for his father to say something or hear something third day lightning bolt hits hell Brett when the show is gonna start you know in order to have a show you have to have lights you got to have action you have drama you have a lot of noise and somebody recording it all oh don't forget the audience got to have the audience so Satan had all planned out from his master table or he had planned all this out right figured God didn't come the first day God wasn't didn't know where he was he went smart enough didn't come the second day he was afraid he wasn't strong enough so now we're moving him from the back of Hell up here we're gonna plan a show that did not happen not the way they planned so when that happened there was a little shudder in hell they remember the lightning bolt that's what took him out of heaven that was the father's only thing he had to do with the whole show it was his sons stands up and the fire of God comes out of his hands it begins to melt one by one the little guys in the back row were really GAD they weren't they were glad they weren't on the front row there's a big opening towards the back of Hell from the courtyard they were trying to cram themselves they were running so fast screaming trying to get away from the Son of God melt everything literally running down this this darkened tunnel they were screaming and jumping running on top of each other they didn't care the principalities were getting the front row and then he melts half the faces of all them some of them managed to get away when I was a little girl I would see them when I went into my places I see these demons their heads were like this big there was this thick their eye sockets were melted their mouths were disfigured and melted and I was standing there and go I wonder what happened to them what what happened to them I don't think hell can melt their own demons I mean I didn't really know until I was taken back in time and I was shown it now I understand completely I don't know why you're chiming this God but I'm enjoying every moment of it until I got the call from the producer saying I'm gonna make a resurrection movie want me to give me spiritual content and trust me they want it in the movie he is not afraid of what any man's gonna say he's waiting 15 years to do this film and he doesn't care he's a businessman okay it says easier to work with business people than religious people because if it doesn't line up with everybody's doctrine they don't want it and they'll crucify you if you put it in there and they said no don't put it in there he's ignoring every one of them I've waited 15 years to do this movie I'm doing it God's way I want my god wants and I don't care what anybody says amen so I'm very excited about this whole thing because the world will finally know Jesus Christ is the son of God not good so God informed me several years ago that I'm gonna put a third show on but I won't be doing it you will it's for the sons and daughters that's why the earth cries out for them to stand up and do something he said I did the first show my son the second show you all get to do the third one lights action drama lots of yelling raising the dead that were cremated I'm serious but if you go to a funeral and he says get up there and take the lid off that John you command that spirit to come back in that body are you going to do it you should say that very loudly because trust me if he says that to you you are gonna know it is the Son of God you're not in your head gonna even have there's no time to even argue with that when he says something you get so empowered you're like sure take the lid off the jar I command your spirit to come back into that body in Jesus name and all the ashes come out like a whirlwind and there's the person that is part of the third show-stopping earthquakes and then telling them put it back the way it was before they happen we are over the earth we are over the ocean we over all of the atmosphere over every creature on this earth we have a Thornton dominion over them we're just finally going to demonstrate it so don't ask me where's that in the word I just told you it's Genesis 1:26 and in Romans what talks about the manifested sons or daughters that is you don't wait for some great name person to come stand somewhere and do it cuz stuffs gonna happen everywhere and who's gonna do something about it we are with Jesus Christ don't think I'm too old you don't care for ninety nine or nine if he picked you he picked you and you sit in your seats all you want to say I don't want to do that it won't work he has this wonderful powerful way about himself to influence you and convince you especially if he comes in person you're gonna go and you're gonna think you're gonna melt into the ground when those eyes that blaze with passion for you look in you and say but I need you to do this you're gonna run over top of everybody you know you're not gonna care what one person says you're not gonna be very quiet by the way practice yelling people go on quiet you won't be quiet on that day I was a person who never spoke I was happy never speaking to anybody I think I spoke to two kids people in high school I wasn't trying to be a part of anything care at a tribe they spoke all the time I didn't need to hear someone else talking I was the person who never of us the wallflower the one who never wanted to say anything I didn't want to hug people I had enough people hugging me at home I didn't want to hug people I cared about him you know god help him I did help them my dad did so I helped my help my dad helped people but still I was a person who never wanted to be known I would have never had pink hair on my head I like my long blonde hair I didn't ask for pink hair Jesus Christ came in person sat on my loveseat at 4 a.m. put his arm around me so I thought my body was gonna melt into his it began to tell me what my destiny was this is after they've been taking me to heaven since 1996 now he tells me the other side of the story and then he hooks him he goes and we need you to have pink highlights in your hair I didn't dare voice anything who was gonna tell the Lord of glory I don't want to do that and then in my head I'm thinking why you know why my daughter's gonna get married in two months the in-laws already think I'm strange all over takers walk down the aisle with pink he knows every thought you're thinking and he looks at me and pleases are on your toes because it is absolutely necessary that when the world sees you and they hear you and they know you know us but you love and you have pink hair you're never going to judge them they'll listen to anything you say we need that pink hair is heaven's marketing plan I'm sure there's not a pastor on this earth that ever thought God would use pink hair as a marketing plan I've met some of them for four years I served so many pastors of different events in my city love them they knew me so well but I had gone over the deep end when I had pink hair put on my head I want y'all y'all need to get more of the Spirit in you because you could too son you know know me by the spirit not the not the flesh right it's a flesh test and just get ready for you ask you to have green hair I wouldn't encourage you to go get it because he has a purpose for it and I've been trying to explain ever since I've had this since 2006 I've had pink hair I've won more people to Lord then I had my entire life before that it works just stand somewhere if you're over fifty someone's gonna come and ask you what is that well on Heaven's ambassadora they have hair like this in heaven and then I start talking about the things they like cuz Jesus is telling me the Holy Spirit is telling me the whole time I'm stinging in front of them talk about the talk about the extreme sports in heaven I was talking to two teenage girls on the beach I think Jen was there yeah they had skateboards with them but you know a skateboard a skateboard right so I start talking about extreme sports in heaven where you don't even need a helmet you do 100-foot jumps and your skateboards got fire coming out of it and they drop their skateboards dock 14 what are you talking about I was told there wasn't a god oh no I've met him I been to his home called heaven and you would not believe the things I have there and did you know he made you and did you know you lived in him before you came here they don't care about any doctrine they've only heard God hates them because they're sinners they've only been told about Hell not God so I talked to them for 40 minutes they're so filled so excited about God do you want to know where they could go they went to give yourself to him they want to know where can I go that I can hear this stuff I said well I don't know how many places are here yet but the church I go to they do teach about heaven that there is a heaven did you teach you how to live your life set your blessing him helping people that's the way you talk to people you're not you're not accusing them of anything I talk to them like they know him and that's what God said talk to them like they already know us then they're interested so in this time learn how to talk to people and you know what the angel standing around you they're gonna help keep you protect you especially if you command an army from heaven that might be new to you too don't be afraid by that we are over the Angels is that true everybody are we gonna judge them and they succumb well you can't judge somebody that you're under you need to start thinking about what the Bible says about you make a list stand in front of a mirror and say it every day I did that I did it all the time and one day Jesus walked in my wall and the wall of my home and he keeps walking in there all the time it's not impossible for you to go to heaven and see heaven it's quite wonderful but I'm not ready to go over there I know people go the cry when they have to leave I don't cry because I'm not gonna leave here without fulfilling everything he wants me to do and that is to help campaign for this coming election I'll have I have a new studio I'm gonna have a broadcast at least once a week jump on the Trump 2020 train give reports from heaven the whole time but God is saying and then you see things happen through the whole election God has a plan for this country to make it a pattern for other countries leaders to one after we just have to love those that don't understand or don't like it but their lives even their lives are better than they were before even they are benefiting I know people who blasted and yelled and hollered and yet they're small businessmen they get 25percent reduction on their taxes and they don't say no they're gonna vote for him this time because something actually happened during someone's term that did something to help them amen everybody stand up we're gonna declare something you don't have to but you can and then we're gonna have some Q&A time it's hard if I have a Q&A if I start with cueing any time I never want to stop it's hard to stop so I can stop what I'm talking about so we can have some because people have questions and it's my London or my favorite things to do is to answer people's questions if I know I'll answer if I don't I just say I don't know amen so we're going to clear something say father I am your child I want your will your way in my life and for this earth so I declare the upcoming election in 2020 the one you have chosen will win in a landslide you will show your favor over that administration and give them new things to do to help our country be greater than it ever was before and God because I care I pray for the other side the blinders we've taken off the rise they will stop hating they will start loving that they will benefit from this whole thing because this is your plan and we want your man so help the others God because we're running our race your will your way hallelujah [Applause] we need to shout on that everybody [Applause] we're we need more in the body of Christ like cat that lays it down I mean 24 years because she's heard God and she's not ashamed to proclaim what God has told her regardless of the persecution she takes and I know she doesn't say but it's got to be something else on Facebook and different things and quotes and things that people say and she is dedicated committed to her God and so as we go into the question and answers we want to take an offering for her and pass offering the offering baskets for her while we're doing this because this is a fun time so go ahead and have a seat and pastor Brooke if you and Renato could take these mics so that we can get every question on it so our streamers can hear the questions oh she's awesome so she doesn't have to repeat it up here and father we just thank you once again Lord God for this ministry and this and this marketplace ministry that's out there father and it's a business Lord God you have all of that wrapped up in in this precious one called Kat and Lord we thank you for her obedience to do what you called her to do and it empowers us Lord David and I as you know we have been empowered in these last two nights we've been empowered with a new boldness if that's possible I don't know what we're gonna be like but father God we are going into an upgrade we are all upgrading so Lord we want a blessed camp we want to bless this ministry we wanted to go out to the outermost parts of the earth and Lord she doesn't even need this money because she's got you we need to give and we need to support and we need to deposit because Lord were sowing so that we can then benefit within ourselves Lord God's so that we upgrade so we can be these fiery lions and lionesses out there roaring so Lord we just thank you for leading and guiding our giving tonight in Jesus name okay tell us tell us how to get we get so people don't know some people understand this and this is what we're gonna do this is the order we're gonna do on this side on this side and on this side we're gonna rotate back and forth we're not oh you'll be on this side pastor Brooke on this side and what you do you'll take your questions we'll have the questions come up on this side or this side and ask the questions here so we can have the mics so then it'll be clear for the cameras too so awesome and so you can give online at WWE or on your mobile phone text go mz2 seven seven nine seven seven and you'll seek a career there or you can give cash or check now the questions I want to say just a couple of words about the questions some people think they don't have one until they hear the first one the answer and then everybody has questions and I'm a detail person that's why God picked me so most questions have a lot of detail to them so and you're gonna love every one of them it doesn't matter you're going to learn from this Q&A session but try to keep it to questions about heaven itself about the spirit realm activities or about the time we're living in right now because some people go into it's not it's easy to answer a personal question about yourself because most of the stuff he gives me is for the corporate body of Christ so it should be something that everyone here would be interested in I wanted to know the answer to it makes it much easier for me because if I answered everybody's personal question we would literally be here all night long so try to keep it to something and just one question okay somebody showed up one time they had 115 questions on the lid I heard from a prophet a long time ago that you are a wise person if a prophet is coming and you want a question you write it down and hand it to that prophet put your phone number on it or your email and eventually you'll hear something back but if you come unprepared then you're gonna go over with whatever God gave them to share when you missed your chance to ask something that you want to know so always come prepared okay and any of the questions if you don't get to come up here and speak in them write it on a piece of paper and leave it at the products table with your first name and your age and where you're from because I am literally looking for a lot of new questions for book three and we're gonna change out all the ones that are on our website so we're always looking for new questions so it's not going to be lost okay so let's just get the first question when the father asks us to resurrect the ashes can it be a person this would be somebody who just recently died yeah you're not learning upbringing they're not coming anyway somebody been dead it's been 10 years you think they're gonna leave heaven look I know you've walked on truly Europe they're a part of your lives but if you could go there and see how they were living you wouldn't ask them to come back just be prepared when you go and you know what's gonna happen to get there then no wonder they didn't want to come back down here in their old bodies so it would normally this would be somebody who just died like at a funeral and you were at the funeral something like that unless one thing so this is help this is what happens I was shown in the future and the entire plane crashes everybody's burn up in the plane like to ashes and a believer goes in resurrects everybody up that burned up in the plane they all come back to life they get their bodies back they even have their clothes on that is something that will be that will happen that's like a greater work or Manifest asunder so that could be something like that but it's usually something that just happened okay so I know that the Lord promotes us on earth as we're faithful right so are we going to be continued to be promoted when we're in heaven into eternity well God I think everybody heard that question I kind of say it a god promotes us on the earth and it says that he's the one who lifts up and puts down we know he does that and sometimes even unexpected people unknown people he does that and he's certainly gonna do that a lot like over the next 20-30 years you're gonna see that happen a lot down here God has his ways to reward you when you get to heaven and you cannot say no to that reward that reward you'll never forget for the rest of your existence and that is the main way God rewards you in heaven for all you've done on the earth for him even things you didn't even think he was aware of but he doesn't stop rewarding you so it's not so much like you have to be promoted in heaven you're already promoted because you move there the gift he put in you people will run to see you use that gift so you in a way your whole life changes whatever your passion is he putting you to do with your natural gift he prepares everything in heaven for you to use that gift so a lot of people going to come they're going to celebrate who you are they're gonna love it so that way is a non-stop promoting of you because of the way he designed heaven so you're gonna love it you're gonna just love it Kat has the Lord shown you much about the destiny of New York and Connecticut I'd like to know better how to pray and I am from those areas originally I do know that New York is going to become a region of light in this country yes because of and he even explained vine because they were willing to open their borders to bring all the unwanted the ones coming to find rescue New York was very unique for God's purpose for it and they fulfilled that purpose that many purpose he had was for them to welcome them in people came from all over the world set up their own settlements and then because some of them became very great people they went to other places but New York was like a birthing place for people for their destinies for their gifts and God is planning to honor that it will become a region of light where one point there'll be no crime no sin and no sickness and I was I was born in New York so I also know that I left heaven and was sent to New York New York Yankee sent all the way to the deep south I promised to tell people that okay if you come to floor don't worry about being carried off by an alligator you probably will never even see an alligator they don't roam they're not like the Buffalo they have to stay in the water or their hide will fall off the only time you see an amount of the water is crossing the road to go to another body of water their height is about this thick and the dinosaurs even we see how these questions go the dinosaurs on the earth when it was made the first time they could not have survived on the earth like it is now because those dinosaurs had to stay in continual mist and water so the atmosphere was like a continual mist the sky was a peachy pink the Sun wasn't there he lit the original earth with his glory and they did wrong with watch her angels that's why they find footprints it's not a human footprint it's a watcher angel they hadn't flesh on them there is a history lesson go ahead what's the next question first of all I want to say thank you for being the gift and the wrap the Revelator day you are so we love you and the other one is without giving too much away when you us to expect your next book and King without giving all of it away what to expect in the next book I am working on the next book but God has a timeline for that and he says the movie has to come first because it'll take one-third of my life every year to work in the movie in Hollywood on the movie and I have to be honest I have to be then when they do anything because of the spirit realm they've never seen it so even though we give them sketches and drawings they're not quite sure the activity or the words that were spoken at that time what does the atmosphere feel like so they have creators who are going to work on all the spirit realm stuff I have to be present when that's done as you present when they actually create the sets I have to be present when they do the filming and so I'll probably get the weekends off and that's going to take 18 months just when they get to that part so I'll be working on an off on book 3 it will be 3 times bigger then it'll be the last one called revealing heaven number 3 so he started a relationship with you in heaven in book 1 and book two increases in every level it shows you more of what's in heaven book 3 is going to show things that will shock you and stun you that's in heaven it'll it'll have a picture of a human soul I can tell you that literally how he made your soul how it operates will be in the book even the scene from the third day in hell I can tell you that will be when the illustrations I have 25 illustrations I'm working on I always do those first and then he gives me the chapter titles of what to write about because I know so much about it it's going to be stunning i opening and you will celebrate a lot when you see the things that are that are going to be in that third book they'll even be prophecy at the end about the future and even some scenes from the future like one of the planets that will be created when the new earth is made so it's gonna be pretty cool since we are part of the putting on the third show like the X power 'full first show and second show can you tell us anything about that that you might know and one other thing anything about John F Kennedy jr. um I have not seen John F Kennedy jr. in heaven that doesn't mean he's not there heaven is bigger than our whole galaxy it's a plan it's a world it's not a flat place and almost every picture I've seen of heaven all they can draw as the throne room they don't know they know there's a throne room there so you see a picture of the throne room right and usually the father and the son are on the back wall and there's like a mass of millions of people I can tell you not like that the throne-room is in the middle the throne is in the middle of the throne room and there's four sets of steps that go up there so everybody can run up and see them whenever they want to so that part needs a little correction because he's not on the back wall away from everybody the throne room expands because it's alive he can hold as many people as he wants to I can just tell you the third show would be one of the greatest of all because it's what God has purpose went from the time we lived in him and he sent us and took our little spirit man and knit it together in her mother's womb with our flesh body we can't make a spirit man people we can't make anything that has made out of spiritual content we just can't that's God's only God can do that part so there is no life until the spirit is attached to that data flesh and we will see so many powerful things some of the things I've been talking about even tonight will be part of that third show but one of the things I don't talk a lot about is the presence of the glory the presence of the glory will be so powerful most people don't know what the glory is they know it's probably going to be beautiful it's going to be amazing it literally is like carrying the life of God yourself and in operating at sometimes without measure everyone has a measure the work talks about us operating in a measure god gives those measures but some of the manifests the sons of daughters who will be everyday people will operate when they're operating it'll be like without measure the power be so tremendous that sometimes it will impact an entire state when something is demonstrated or done sometimes it will impact an entire country what will happen I know the Dead will be raised in mass like thousands at one time by one person and so these are some of the things and this is part of the third show it won't be one day it's not going to be like you know in hell on the third day that was a day and heaven it wasn't just a de space-time there's no time in heaven but it it wasn't something he could do if there was time you think about one third of the Angels he kicked out along with their leader that probably if there was time would have been a while along enough for them to have a big party going on the whole time and pretty sure that happened because they were all happy he was kicked out they you think about it heaven was holy it was pure it was undefiled they all loved one another they work together you know like brothers did God made tribes of angels for very specific purposes they all knew their own purpose they were happy about why he made them to do the Army was there they had no enemy to fight there was no enemy but God had made an army for the specific person purpose of fighting against the dark army there was no dark army until Lucifer decided to take over they knew who their enemies would be from that point on and so I just can tell you this that the show is going to be tremendous it will be ongoing probably for several generations which will also shift the way all of our lives will begin to operate for several generations after that and I know people have a timeline for the rapture nobody knows that day except the father and he's the one saying this stuff okay he showed me the next fifty years of my life that doesn't mean it's my last assignment I just know exactly what I'll be doing for the next 50 years what platforms I'll be operating for him and I'm telling you I just started the fifty year or so so I can guarantee you I know it's even beyond that time and because it doesn't end until God says it ends amen and even that I think the probably the last big show will be the marriage supper of the Lamb I've also been shown parts of that it's going to be beyond anything you ever imagined it only gets better with God you don't lose it's worth anything to be a part of him and what he wants it's not worth anything to help hell hell doesn't celebrate anybody they take the worst people who sold their self literally met the Satan so that really does happen - and lies to them like he did I mean he did that in heaven right he did that on the earth even tried to attempt Jesus to do that he's never changes them all and so he does get people to do all kinds of horrific things and he promises them with lies I'll give you power Authority I'll give you part of my kingdom you'll rule with me he tortures them worse than anyone else and makes a show of it himself in hell he hates them worse than anybody they get nothing they get worse done to him done to them than anyone else who just rejected tries it's only worse and bad for them okay so he didn't love anyone don't help him don't advertise for him it's about time we start advertising about the glory God and the goodness of the earth and the good things that are happening all over this earth because I don't think the fake news understand that or they don't know about it but there are powerful things happening right now in this earth that God is in charge of that are happening about people loving one another countries helping each other and you never see that that's gonna change okay next question I always imagined heaven as being the sort of place where everybody can fly around and have SuperSpeed and stuff so like during the kingdom age does that mean people will be able to do that here I would say since we're all saying on earth as it is in heaven I have to see some of that happening here and I'm sure at different times if you need you - why wouldn't you fly I mean why wouldn't you he transported Phillip through the sky on a chariot he's not the only one he did that to either so why not because yes to do fly in heaven I was take a new place and this is C this is what rocks people is not the fact that tell me flying heaven is who teaches you to do that in heaven that the religious minded I get they almost like gnash their teeth when I tell them things like this because they can't see in their head happening I was taken to a place in heaven that was this massive amusement park it's in my first book it really exists I've been there several times since then it has the impossible impossible impossible things happening that you have so much fun with doing and this is the thing if somebody receive Jesus Christ as their Savior as they were dying they will be in heaven and they will still use the gift God sent them as so if you sent them doing wonderful fun things they have movies in heaven no defilement no profane language no sexuality no graphic violence forget it you could there's no ratings they don't need them but heaven makes ratings for our movies down here our is rotten [Laughter] pg13 partly good 13 percent PG partly good G mostly good so remember that when you go to watch a movie Superman teaches you how to fly huh Christopher Reeves Christopher Reeves teaches you to fly you think about the humor and all that because they have a place where you actually learn you don't just jump up and do it there's things you have to learn in heaven there's things just given to you and you do it but he wants you to discover things I mean he's our Father like you want your kids to discover things and then you do them how wonderful does that make you feel well it's no different in heaven so they have a place in heaven where you can go and they have stands for all your friends and family to come watch you learn to fly it doesn't work out the first time there's more laughter in heaven than anything in this earth and people invite their friends on purpose to learn because they know they're gonna have a mini show right there so everybody's friends and family are waiting because they've already learned right they can just dream they have the beginners area god smart you could hit each other and weren't hurt but why right so they have the beginners area where you learn basic instructions on flying then you have the intermediate area then you have whatever you want to go in heaven so this is the basic every time where the beginners learn and most of them get out there and they try to fly this is one thing I've seen them doing they're trying to fly across the air that doesn't work sometimes they look like they're rowing a boat I don't know what they're doing and some of them just throw their selves out there and they spin spin spin spin spin spin spin spin but your instructor will stop you in eventually you learn no this is very distance it's just like right just right you better learn to laugh there's a lot to laugh and sometimes it's you but yes you will fly in heaven so why not down here you never know what he's gonna do with you I walked on there I didn't expect that I've been talking about it I stepped right off and just kept walking and so I was just doing what was normal and it became super naturally heaven normal so what's the next question so I have a lot of visions of the kingdom of God and a lot of it's similar I'm walking up step Jesus gives me the keys and opened the door and I see a lot of rooms I see a lot of items he wants me to take does that actually change this 3d realm I mean what's the point in all that we're talking about why you're on the earth you're talking about why you're in heaven if I see the kingdom of God and I have a vision and the in Jesus gives me something what's on point to that there's a point to and I'm sure he's got a point I'd always know the point but it's the same thing that how he operates with me he'll show me something and it might be years later and then I do it that doesn't mean he's not going to let you do it because he has timing for everything he has times he reveals things that's what he's doing then there's times he activates it was something you do or an event that's gonna happen he will activate it and then you will actually do it and there will be there are places built on this earth in spiritual areas where because of what we're doing in who we are in this time we will have access to those places and do things and that's probably what he was showing you that was awesome I just want to thank you first of all for supporting our great president because the fake news lies about him all the time and I thank you for doing that and also I want to also thank you that in 2009 my husband and I lost our youngest son to an accident you came here a few months later for your first time here in 2010 mm-hmm and you you actually said a portal opened up above the ceiling here and you you described him you saw him hanging by his legs off the porch yeah I want to thank you for that because what's his name Luke yes it was and the for him and the first time I heard you speak before you said that I was you know my flesh was like what is she talking about I mean of course I believed in heaven but we believe for his bodily resurrection here and it happened and I know you said just a while ago that that would not happen because he doesn't want to come back you're not as much as he loves you this is how they feel in heaven they don't they don't feel like I stay have no sorrow they have no grief there isn't any in heaven they celebrate knowing one day you're going to be there with them and their whole focus is you being there and to them it's not like 10 years have gone by they don't even think timewise like like we would on the earth so all I can tell you is he still feels the same way he's still having an awesome time and he is watching this meeting and my question for you is as far as I know you spoke about atheism last night you said that all people have got in them he put that in them and my father is an atheist I've been praying for him for 20 years and my question is can I command the host of heaven to go and save him because I just spoke to him on Father's Day and nothing's changed don't go Bible and anything you're hearing or seeing do not go by what the evidence is in the natural you have to believe what God's Word promises you okay he promises you he says if you believe in something say and you do not doubt in your heart you shall have what whatsoever you say so don't change what you're saying don't change it okay that's the best thing closure I can give you okay this is the question I've been wanting to ask you for a while in heaven there's no sin and so this scripture has kind of puzzled me where it says if you don't forgive neither will you be forgiven and so if you're a Christian and there's somebody you hadn't forgiven how does that work there's a big difference in being angry and upset and for unforgiveness consuming you unforgiveness is like a spirit to consumes you just being angry and upset for somebody and you don't want to say you know it's okay there's a big difference God is the only one who can judge that he's not turning people away because they had a reason to be angry or upset and you don't want to speak to somebody or if you think about him you it hurt you inside it's more you losing stuff from your soul loose all that all the trauma whatever you experience from them whatever they said you did you need to lose that from your soul and the reason for that is you won't think about it no more because sometimes we're hurting worse holding back from something then the person who actually did something to us and let me tell you if they make it to heaven they will not remember that people don't remember those things when they get to heaven they love you no matter who you are and they don't want anyone suffering over something they caused to happen on or something someone on the earth did to them because that is what Satan will do he will take whatever caused you to feel that way and he will ram it down you everyday and he will make that that that block longer and bigger he'll cause that division between you to be stronger if you let him do that so God says look at what's happening to you and deal with that first because when that's dealt with you it will become be very easy one day for you to say I'm just gonna let it go and I'm going to forgive them but the more you dwell on it and meditate on those things it will get stronger have a stronger hold on you so in God even said the the person who's carrying that the person who's carrying that in them it's because they're suffering from something and yet the person who caused it probably isn't even thinking about anymore or maybe they are maybe they're just being hateful to you but their freedom comes when your freedom comes so don't let that be something that consumes your Reks your life or your destiny because that happened to you don't carry it you loose it what you loose on earth they will loose in heaven and you will get to a place where it doesn't even affect you then you can say this even though I don't feel like this in my flesh I choose as an act of my will to forgive that person and that way your emotions are not even involved okay I kept Hey I just wanted to thank you first of all for your first book I took a book to Venezuela after my mother passed away and everybody got set free from greevey and yes and from depression they were so sad after they read your book I told him this is was true well my question tonight is an originally from Venezuela I've been here 40 years mm-hmm has the Lord show you anything about the evil government be in Venezuela removed absolutely soon absolutely is shown he's talked to me about Venezuela and actually I was having the event in Orlando and a woman came all the way from Venezuela right when it started brought me the Venezuelan flag and said I'm giving you to this to take before the course of heaven and before the Father himself to bring a resolution for our country so that it can be free to the people who want to serve you there will be free to serve you and God said I will do it God said it only takes one person sometimes to move his heart and then this woman came for only that reason all the way from that country with that flag so God would be able to do something because of her words and what she declared and she was from there he cannot reject or let her words drop to the ground so you will see something major happened in Venezuela what you say that's what I've been doing I can't be clear in the Venice oil I set free and I tell my family there's be set free by the Word of God the power of God amen I [Applause] would like to say one more thing about the woman who talked about unforgiveness especially especially if something happened between you and a loved one I started to start to talk about that than I didn't and finish it no matter what relationship you had here if that person goes to heaven they will have more love for you than they ever had down here on this earth love you cannot even understand in your mind right now you cannot conceive of the love of God living inside of somebody who has hope for you who is declaring over you that's asking God to bless you even if they didn't treat you right when they were here if they died suddenly and you were not expecting it they understand God understand sometimes that can create a wound and you don't let that won't be there that person is having the time of their life they're not just exist ting they're living they live in his love they're filled with his life and the greatest thing they would ever want for you is for you to complete your destiny they may their destiny may be finished in heaven sometimes some people don't realize that I've even seen young people who were raised up here on this earth and when they got to heaven they finished their destiny so even young people don't miss that and and you may heart have a hard time understanding that but God still has plans for children or for people and they have a destiny their ultimate destiny in heaven is to be that gift whether it's to run a golf course or a fishery or a carnival or a you know a rodeo have a line of bakeries in heaven whatever that gift was they never got to use on the earth they will still use that in heaven but the thing that I noticed the most on there is how much love people have I feel ways of it coming from the people these are the ones who've moved home to heaven and how much they care about their family members and they're declaring over every member of their family not just one of them so something great happens on the inside of them when they see him before the one that they came from and the Lord has courts him up the steps of the throne and gives him literally back to the Father they know they are home and they know that's who sent them to that earth men's I want encourage anybody if you've lost somebody recently they're never going to forget you they're not going to replace you no one can ever replace you on this earth but in case you wonder it's okay to love again and that may not be the right time to tell you but you just need to know that one day that may happen whoever's in heaven that loves you is not going to be angry at you if you have someone to love they're probably asking God to send you someone to love and this is the point when you get home you're not married to anybody that means you can still have them as your best friend and so that you're ready that relationship if you are married on the earth you're a little bit closer together as best friends you know the people that weren't so it's not like that relationship is gone you're just not married for a reason and this is the reason and it's a really good reason the reason we go home and we're not married when we get there we come home is the father son or daughter you live right next to the people that you were married to you'll be best friends but there's a legitimate reason because we can only have one bridegroom it would not be right and the Holy Spirit gave me this revelation just a couple weeks ago somebody was asking me about that and I said well I think there's probably a good reason why you're not married and so I was told this is why you were not married there's going to be a marriage in heaven and there can only be one bridegroom and that bridegroom is for both male and female we will be the Bride of Christ you can't be married to someone else it wouldn't be right that is that was very revelatory so knowing people I say ask me well how come on can't be married I said because you already have a marriage waiting on you in heaven and we are all patrols to one person and his name is Jesus Christ and no matter how you feel about each other here when you get there you will love him more than anyone in existence so there's only one bytecode and one bride and we're it so maybe I don't know what time it is probably have time to take a couple more Oh who's next okay other than being in the presence of the Most High God and Jesus Christ what was your most memorable and transformational experience that you took from heaven in heaven it is hard to talk about that there's probably more than one one was when I was caught up to heaven I don't remember which what time that was what what number that was I gave up after about a thousand times I stopped counting but I remember very clearly every time I've gone but the one impacted me the most because I'd seen Jesus many times on the earth doesn't mean I'm familiar with him I'm still overwhelmed and undone but this was with the father because I knew he loved everybody people picture him super glued to the throne they think he can never leave it that's ridiculous okay he goes all over heaven he's year's time with everybody in heaven but he has his own special place he takes you to and it says it talks about in the world where it says that and all you're getting of knowledge get understanding and it says that is knowledge of the Holy One that's the father so that's why he you hear me talk so much about the father Jesus said I want you to introduce the father to the earth let them know about his love what he thinks about them how they live before they were here so they'll understand and love him like they do me because there's a lot about Jesus and the board people had encounters with Jesus everywhere not so much with the father but in this time he wants us to know him so he caught me up one time when he catches me up I'm always eight years old so that's why I remember things it's real easy to remember that's what he doesn't give me things he doesn't use long words even when he speaks to me up there he speaks to me like I'm a real child I have pigtails and I'm very excited when I rob didn't want to run up and sit on his lap so he can hold me because I understand he is my my father he he's our Father and I love this goodness Abba Father you know or daddy however you want to look at it when you get there that's how you're gonna think about him he caught me up one time but it wasn't to the throne he took me by my hand and this is the thing about God he can be a 150 foot tall if he wants to be he means big as a source if he wants to be he's big okay he can hold anyone in his arms no matter how big you are here you're not so big that he can't hold you in his arms but he can also make himself smaller so he can walk right next to you so here my look grow pigtails I'm looking up at him his hair is filled with life it's white it's just beautiful as glowing his eyes have flames of fire blue flames of fire and he's got the most gentlest spirit I tell people Jesus is the Waring one Jesus is the warring King me but the father has such love in him because of his son before his sudden you know he would pour out his wrath on the others and remember that he wiped it out remember only did that he's not like that anymore because of what his son paid for he's loved itself kindness itself and he took my hand I've been doing this probably for several years you took my hand he said come I'm gonna take you into my chamber and it said on it chamber of understanding and it was this place like this massive gemstone a huge massive gemstone because you have to remember the stones of fire are in him we he has one that's his own special place that he takes people to especially when they come home to heaven so he can get to know you better and so I walked in there I wasn't afraid of anything and then it was this whirlwind of the dark glory and that says I hide myself in the dark remember the dark clouds of glory it looks like a million peacock feathers with eyes in them with real eyes and that's what he sometimes will hide himself in and but when I stepped in there with him they were gone it was this beautiful place and that wasn't massive outside but inside it was like it looks like it went forever and he looked at me said where would you like to go and I said well I want to be right here with you I don't need to go anywhere he said I can take you to the future I can show you the new earth I didn't show you things to come on what no I know I want to be here with you like I I want to be here with you I don't need to go in order goes I can take you to the past I can show you heaven before Lucifer fell I can show you before the earth was made don't you want to go and I said no right here it's where my heart is my heart is for you my heart is to do you will you love me before I came enough to send your son that you love so much that even at one point had to turn your very back on him because of he had to take all the evil and I'm just a little girl saying this to him Hey because you wanted me just like me and there's no greater place anyone could ever desire to be tend to be with me and so I know it blessed his heart so much that's why I remember it so clearly that it was burned in me and I can't see him any other way I can't see him as a god of Wrath I can't see him as a God of anger or vengeance or a wanting to pour something up on you if he is willing to give the most precious thing he had for us before even while we were yet sinners he sent his precious son who was everything they did everything together before even became Jesus when he was the word they created together they went everywhere together and he was willing to send them you know why so we could come back to him that's how much he loves people he loves them that's why he is long-suffering that's why he said he doesn't even want the vilest sinner set free but we have to make a choice he won't force people to take him and I know right now there's people preaching that God's going to restore all things and they throw in that when they say that they literally mean everything he's gonna not make a new earth he's gonna restore this one he's gonna forgive Satan he's gonna remove the fallen angels he's gonna make it like it never happened that is not what he said and I would just say what he said to me he said I cannot allow things to come to this holy place he said I gave my son I'm not keeping you out of heaven I'm making a way for you to come to heaven because I am not allowing or permitting evil wickedness sin to come back into this place again and pollute I can't do it so I'm not doing something to keep you out I did something to let you come in but you have to make that choice he says so people who say a loving God wouldn't send people to hell I don't I make a way so they don't have go there but they will choose their self where they will live so he is a loving God but he doesn't want you wouldn't want he said if I let everyone on earth who ever existed to come to heaven then heaven would be just like the earth and that is not going to happen you would not want that to happen yourself so unfortunately there are people in hell I have been to hell he won't let me talk about it because he's still introducing heaven it's real it's worse than you ever dreamed like heaven is great or Mabuse 11 then you ever great dreamed Satan loves nobody well I give yourself I'm not willing so praise that you won't be willing and you will learn to forgive and you will learn to but this is the thing you can share love love is the greatest thing he ever made but love includes truth I used to say you can't give love and not give truth because you're not really loving but actually it's part of it so if you love you have to share the truth amen so don't leave it out somewhere and just only share love he'll love people all the way to hell because they're choosing that love is a wonderful way to show them you care and he cares but you can't leave out the truth amen so any more questions oh she has a question from Facebook oh let her answer yes we're we want to know what God wants to do for Colorado and we were battling Hell here and we need help from heaven to overcome the fifth chair I do know that and so does God he's not ignorant to anything and Colorado is also gonna be a region of light and let me tell you what the people sitting in this room have Authority enough to do that you don't need to look to heaven to bring a lightning bolt down here strike someone dead that you don't like who is in office it's your authority taking over the evil the demonic that is ruling that is controlling those people that's why we were given an army they will bombard continually send them continually to wherever that person sits whatever their title is send them against the demonic controlling them I will also add this we're living in a time where if they won't yield God will take them from the earth that would be his last choice but because of this time were in that he calls holy and powerful for us he wants us especially if it's a place he calls his own and I don't know why he some would be regions of light popping because of who will choose to live in those places reasons the regions of darkness and talk too fast regions of darkness will exist because people want them and the regions of light will begin to produce the glory of God and those people will run from those places because they so want the evil they still want to live that way they want that lifestyle they will not be able to live in a place for God the glory of God is powerful and the reason it's powerful is because you're carrying it it's not a great wave coming from heaven to sit on a place it will be in us Christ in us is the hope of glory that glory will become a region in places in the earth so what you do is begin to live more like God declare like him hear him come against any evil entities spiritual entities and they will begin to be driven out and then the influence they had over those people will be gone and fear will fall on those who are leading that's how it works so it's in you and the way you live your life and what you say and how you operate is what will change things in this earth Damon okay we're gonna let somebody on line ask a question you can I have the microphone I wasn't gonna ask any of these questions I told him on Facebook that I was screams taking screenshots of them to save them for a future podcast but this one needs to be answered and I know you've talked about this before but it's kind of a two-part question the first part she said can a believer who commits suicide go to heaven and the reason she asked is because Judas had committed suicide in the Bible but a young girl said that she saw him in heaven I don't know who the young girl was but he is in hell and even Jesus himself said that he did not remain with him number one Judas was never a true believer he fought against everything Jesus did he wanted Jesus to take over the world so he would benefit from it he did not have any love for him at all and he gave himself to Satan he never repented for what he did he went out for the guilt he had he hung himself judas is in hell and Jesus said father I have all those that you gave me save the son of perdition he did not have him because he was in hell well I can answer the other part of that question why she probably thought she saw him there is a mock heaven in a mock Hell there are things that are built in the spirit realm there's there all around you a lot of them are built by heaven and heaven uses them when their angels are sent on an assignment there's also something built by Hell not very well none of their stuff looks very good but they have places for the demons to gather and in infiltrate places and stuff like that and they have built to bring confusion to the body because the father is catching so many people up to heaven and so many people down to hell Satan always does something to try to stop it bring confusion or counteract it so it would look like somebody's not telling the truth and one of those places is a mock hell and this is the thing about the enemy when he thinks he's winning he gets very sloppy and then he becomes not intelligent and then he'll show people he'll this is something you have to test spirits if an angel comes up you said I'm here to take you somewhere you have to say are you from the spirit of the Most High God who sent his son you die it's very simple you ask them that they can't lie there's no way they cannot they will disappear or they'll say nothing to you but most people just go with them and if you go that means you're open to be shown whatever if it's not an angel there's still demons that can have a measure of light in them now every one of them look like defiled horrible ugly things so if people don't ask like someone a leader in the body was caught up by supposing aliens to be to Saturn did the wings of Saturn and this actually happened and they didn't test them so they went to the rings of Saturn by these demons who said they were aliens and they gave them higher enlightenment to know about the gods of the Egyptians and now they have rejected Jesus Christ they date everything we judge did everything about him said they now serve the God of the Egyptians that's why you have to test spirits so that was not real saddened by the way there was a mock place made in the spirit realm to look like that okay something that is just very right now it's really critical because a lot of people are talking about this the ascension movement where they get in groups and as an act of their will they are all group lifted to what they say is heaven could they be actually going to a mock realm that is is a counterfeit since I've never been a part of that group I know things like that happen and there's always the chance of that happening if you don't have the opportunity to question who is taking you I do know that people are doing that I know some people got his commission to do that there's some people who decide in their own soul to do it their self that is not wise because we do within us the way God made us we do have different authorities within us we have abilities to come in and speak to things and that's how a lot of people got caught in the New Age movement years ago now people are caught in to all kinds of things and they don't understand it's not God because this is saying if they have a real encounter that's the point they made I had a real encounter when a lot of people have real encounters but where did you go and who took you there that's how Satan gets away with these mock places and he's caught all kinds of people to the mock heaven and they all meet mother Mary who was ruling there there's always some kind of a thing that gives you hints something's not right always because I've heard of many encounters people have and there's always a measure of something that is not truth people are caught in the mock hell they're shown children in hell that is absolutely a lie there are no children in hell these people have also seen and talked with mother Mary in heaven that is not true she does not call herself that she is Mary who bore Jesus but she worshiped worships Jesus Christ as her own Savior and then more encounter started building and building Satan took a lot of people to hell because he enjoyed it and it wasn't even the real hell because if they had been to the real hell they'd still be screaming they wouldn't act like it was so nonchalant well I saw Christians there and I was told they won't help because they wore blue jeans how many people got blue jeans on them and then they were told that the Christians weren't helped because they had colored highlights in their hair and then somebody else was taken to the mock Kalen they were said they're always told these are Christians these are Christians because they wore jewelry the horrible part about it is these people believe it because they were little taken by a spiritual being through the spirit room to a place that to them was literally real so that's why it's you need an understanding of the spirit realm you need to understand what that place is it's the original realm that God made it was made before the physical realm in order to make this physical planet he had to take like a canvas the physical realm and stretch it around part of the spiritual realm so we could hang all the planets in the sky so we would have a place to live and have physical body so this stuff happens but Satan still has powers I mean he'll do anything you can to lie to people if you can get them to to be deceived and they say yes then they can be taken to places and he'll say as an angel light this is now your assignment years ago all of this world and share this truth and it's a lie so it's bringing confusion to the body because people thought well I thought I thought you couldn't fake anything well if you believe the father of lies and he's one who created the lie yes but there's a way not to be deceived okay number one don't want after things that you're not aware of or how to operate in those places God give you commissions if an angel really came from him and was supposed to take you you can ask that angel if he says yes I was sent by the Most High then you should certainly go but but this is happening everywhere and I've even seen some people on shows talking about their experiences in Hell and they didn't go to the real hell they didn't go to the real heaven okay they never talk about the glory the splendor the love of God they always talk about people who would not I've heard him talk about people that wouldn't be in heaven I've also talked about people who they say are in Hell and are not in Hell so you have to know who's sharing and you have to know yourself how to discern the spirit and so if anything comes to you and sit just was to go with me you would do if it was a person wouldn't it I mean if some stranger came to your door and said you're supposed to go with me I'm gonna take you so and so we're going to go to the White House go that would you with that person I hope not well it's no difference in the spirit room so you just have to know who is talking to you and if they have the right to talk to you you always have the right to refuse and if you refuse this God and you've tested them they said yes I'm from God and you don't go he'll probably give you another chance and we're done the line to go so yes yes and Satan in the in the day is coming one of the one of the there's we know their signs and wonders but to be unholy signs and wonders it talks about them in the Bible too and this is the thing he will heal people they'll actually have witches don't trust a witch don't watch witchcraft don't read witchcraft have nothing to do with witchcraft witchcraft is real it was real back in the day of Jesus is still real now and none of it is good none of it it is the most controlling thing you can get involved with and you will be deceived over and over again and that's not a good thing and this is what Satan will do he'll have because people be having miracles everywhere right so Satan will have his own in the park and they'll say these witches will say come and join us we're a good coven we love people we can heal you do you have something needs to be healed and they'll heal them in front of everybody all Satan has to do is remove the disease that he put there and it will be a mock healing just to bring deception to people so we're a little ways away from that happening but as much as you can get understanding on the better your prepared but I will just say this to you Satan has used Harry Potter for years to introduce witchcraft is being good if you read it loose it from your soul if you have it get rid of it if you just watch it lay their hands and loose it from their soul because the author hates Christians and they literally practice witchcraft and that book I've never read it but people tell me stuff in it some of those acts that they do in those books and now this they sell spell kits is real witch cloud there are even a Harry Potter University being built in Richmond Virginia and guess how many people Robbie's in there because it's a fantasy they think and not a fantasy nothing from hell is a fantasy amen so there's always there's always good stuff to share with you powerful stuff to share with you but but if you can receive a warning that will save you a lot of stuff later in your life then just receive it because I do know I'm going to see her since there's a little girl and I saw operations of Hell everywhere I know what they do to trick people mark people follow people so when you send get marked by the enemy then they follow you and try to get you to fall again so nothing's being hidden there's an unseen world sees you all the time okay so live up right right just get rid of the junk get rid of it it'll be like it was never there enemy will have no way to track you or find you and he should have nothing to do with you no right to do anything to you and you can say that too but the good news is this we're entering into a time where you have to understand the more of God the spirit realm around you which has always been here I see beings operating everywhere all the time even here what I've been present in the hotel outside the hotel everywhere I go I see activities I am purpose sometimes we'll say something to the demons because they don't think you can see them I make sure they know who I believe then I ask the host to go attack them then they run screaming down the street the host is just falling behind and whacking them with their sword you know crushing them and so I reek havoc wherever I go that's good and there are kids doing it right now their children will be raised in this time to begin to know we find out about the glory we will get to carry the glory but our kids will live in the glory and their kids will know nothing but the glory which is why God needs generations on the earth when you start something new he needs generally in order for it to operate so I can say if you're young you have a long powerful life ahead of you and if you're not young asked to be timeless and get ready to live longer because you have a decision to make for God you don't have to be bound by time even now if you choose not to so this is a great time to be on the earth I think we'll probably take one more one more question does he have a question oh I want to hear his question okay he was curious to know if you could describe what heaven looks like specifically wondering is it bright yellow is it golden but if you could maybe describe its characteristics landscapes just I I can share Hume in this but I've seen so much of it it is all light there's no darkness in heaven nobody ever sleeps because they never get tired they have rainbow bridges they have arrogance they can fly on they have dinosaurs you can ride on they have fountains filled with chocolate and home is made out of jell-o you can eat they have a fantastic you can go into cartoon village and write a cartoon out and then you go in and you are it okay this is heaven this is really heaven they have rodeos they have they have they have hunting but you do it with a camera the point is this when you hunt the creature you're looking for a supernatural spiritual being it will get you before you ever get it you go back to the clubhouse and there's your face plastered on a 40-foot screen because the creature you're looking for got you first they celebrate Christmas in heaven everybody will end with this one who is it oh the friendly forest there is a friendly forest where the trees talk and they will sing and dance with you even the stones little stones pebbles jump up and down with faces and they sing glories to God the tree cannot brood itself and go to your mansion and root itself and be a friend and talking to have conversations with you I've seen all of us in heaven my sister Jen is writing children's books that will show a lot of these scenes in heaven for children will know the truth about heaven and our Lord and the father and the angels angels are made out of everything they don't all look like us probably half of them don't have our creatures they're very fierce through the army they have weapons coming out of them so trust me the army that bur Texas is through hell terrifying the glory of God is everywhere father sends a wave of his rainbow through heaven to look for you and bring you back to himself in the throne room you never want to leave there they celebrate they have celebrations in the throne room works like a big party they like celebrations sometimes worship is just jump it up and down and screaming you know like they do here on this earth that came from heaven it all creates glory for god it's worship for god angels love to crowd surf at some of the concerts they have in heaven there are real beings that have personalities they care very much for us God made them for us that they're not against you amen any other questions oh I have to answer that one asked he was asking about if anybody commits suicide did they go to heaven it depends on of us actually suicide or not I was caught up by the father on purpose I was going to go to Penn State and he said I'm gonna have you bust a myth that's been around for a long time that people cannot take their life and go to heaven he said that depends on if this suicide or not he said go look up the word suicide in the dictionary sometimes yes me do it and it says someone who willingly knowingly intelligently in the right mind decide they're going to end their life usually is to hurt people like terrorists like terrorist bombers they on purpose choose to no longer live they do it usually for a horrible purpose but what most people are doing aren't ending their life they're ending their suffering and God says I judge and then after he said that he took me three times to heaven people who had ended their suffering but loved Jesus Christ they all three were in heaven they did not want to stop living they loved their families but they saw no other escape the pain was so great they had some of them one had mental issues one had medical issues one had emotional issues and and most of the time one of it was from medicine that was given them to heal them it gave them trauma and continual suicidal thoughts flooded them and today I can't handle this anymore I'm going home to Jesus and they ended their suffering and God said I don't want everyone thinking their loved ones who knew me who believed in me who trusted me even if they fell for some reason but they never gave me up or quit loving me and something happened and their life ended they are not in hell he said I would be an unjust god if I took somebody who loved me and served me and they had an accident and something happened physically to their head that they weren't thinking right all they knew was pain and agony and they couldn't live they couldn't handle the suffering or the thing with the medicine that actually happens a lot they even have things on bottles that say it could give you suicidal thoughts and so God said I'm gonna make sure you understand this he put despair on me despair is what comes right before suicide and you begin to have those thoughts he made me carry it for a week and tell nobody and all I could think in my head it was like I was literally experiencing it there was no I felt no hope and this is and I knew him there was no hope in my mind that this would ever end all I could think of was I'm getting out of here I can't bear to be here this is so great I wanted to be taken but he wouldn't take it from me he told me first he said I will not take it off of you at the end of the week I will take it off of you and you will never forget what that felt like and you understand my people cannot take the agony or the suffering of that bombarding them all the time and it was horrible at the end of the week it was like it never happened and what huh I'm gonna go share that message everywhere and after that I went to Pennsylvania for the first time and shared that message and I found out several people in the meeting had had loved ones who had done that they all ran down front they were crying they were hanging on to me and there was even a well-known person I won't mention their name that their son took his life his ended his suffering and he had been in an accident a well-known person and so this young man has served God his whole life he was like in his late 20s loved Jesus but all he kept saying was I can't handle this he'd been an accident they gave him this medicine they took him off the medicine they had to put him back on the medicine and he finally said I can't I'm leaving I'm leaving he kept telling I'm leaving and then they found him and he was dead and God and he was coming to our city to speak and God said his wife is hiding herself the mother is hiding herself because of all the believer saying is too bad your son is burning in hell the world didn't say that the world this is the awful part the world said were so sorry for your loss you know we want to help console' you we want to comfort you this is the world but the ones in the body were saying instantly he was burning in hell so she hid she wouldn't come out she wouldn't go anywhere she didn't want her face to be seen and she was grieving already right and God said I'm not tolerating this I'm gonna let them know exactly what their son is doing he caught me up to heaven I saw their son I didn't know about them and how was taken to his father's managing because this man was young and I was taken to his father's literally his father's managin being built in heaven and it had this great mantle it was at the foot of the mountain of spices and it was absolutely beautiful and that's where he was staying at that time and there was a trophy on the mantle that said Satan 0 God 1 and it was he was saying that Satan did not get their son then it was walked to the management I saw siblings that weren't even born yet in photographs in this person's mansion and then I saw the son another time he was packing up a horse he was going to go to the mountain of spices to go do a hunt and he said I wish my dad knew there's a new way to shoot animals that won't hurt them and he was packing camera gear so this is how I found out about the hunting and he was going up into these woods to go hunting and he said man I remember all the fun I had with my dad and my brothers one who did this but it's even better now and so I saw these creatures hunting behind the trees I'm sure there was some of the ones he was going to try to get I saw him stop by the clubhouse and register that he was going on this hunt so if he if his scope got the picture that it would be put up there your picture okay is in the in the in the corner the one who took the picture the one they captured is on the screen most of the time the creatures here in Europe they're on the screen so all that was happening and I wrote three pages three days in a row God took me to heaven and showed me the Sun I was also taken into his mother's mansion which was right next door had the name of the family over this part because they were like I called him like like community or family mansions like you live in a whole wing of your own this wing could be like fifty thousand hundred thousand square feet it could be half the size of a city because God's gracious and so I typed all this up he was coming to speak I took it to my pastor and said I got this word he read it he was crying goes you make sure he gets that word they are suffering so much he said I'm an agreement with his word that hit their son it changed him forever it changed his mom came out of hiding she was filled with joining the celebration the father was weeping to know that God cared enough to show that his son were his son was I didn't know where they lived they lived at the big mountains at the bottom of the big mountains in Colorado and so he said that's why I made their mansions there because I knew they would love it and he said and and and this person said we went hunting I took my son's hunting all the time well it wasn't really to kill something as much as it was to have the experience of being together and then all these things I saw was exactly the way they lived their life things he said himself for his mother I saw him wearing plaid like this plaid shirt and jeans and that was exactly what it was wearing when they found him so every over and over again I saw things that disconfirmed them that their son was in heaven amen so thank you thank you

when you hear something that you want to sow into and grab it you sow into it we want to bless her so much when she goes back she's gonna freak out when she sees the multiplication that happens because she is a prophetess and we want to bless the prophetess in her ministry so so because she's gonna go and we're gonna pass baskets at the end but if you have to leave early please make your way up here if you don't if that weirds you out to come up then give it to one of the ushers that are standing in the back and they will receive that offering and put it in the offering basket for you can you turn her up Lisa please oh now you can hear me okay yeah I can hear now it's just making is that making it rain I'm always excited to come here because I don't have you know boundaries put on me some places just afraid of the new and actually it's not really new it's just being revealed and all through time God has done that when it was his time to do something new it was revealed in the earth it was always his plan we're just finding out about it and that's true in every age this come on this earth God has done something new new things to say new ways to live new ways to operate like them because the Bible says we're supposed to do that right course food who are we supposed to be like say Jesus really loud does he want us to operate like he did then don't be afraid to do it you know I'm not afraid of the face of man that's not gonna work I've already been in his presence I know what his heart is I know what the father's plans are for the sir it's not time to end it yet I tell people stop fighting about the time when you want to escape on your rapture odd I have news for everybody the rapture is not an escape it will be a celebration isn't that true it's a celebration because an escape would be fear and he has nothing to do with fear and neither should you there should be no fear in you God holds you in his hand when he's ready he's taking you home nobody can stop that but if he want you to stay nobody can stop that either you know John could have stayed John the Beloved could still be here amongst us if he decided to stay because Jesus said to the disciples what is it you but I love him to remain until they come again has he come again yet then that means John could be here correct how long would that have been so if God decides to keep somebody two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred years now what is it you I'm saying yes by the way I won't even buy a life insurance policy my staff walked into the phone when people want to sell life insurance oh she doesn't want it well can we ask her no it won't do any good but everybody needs it and they go no she's not planning on dying and then they hang up and we all laughed for that but I'm not I have no plans I lay down my life I live in him as long as he wants me here I'm staying I know John missed what he saw he missed it so much he couldn't stand to be here anymore nobody took his life either nobody killed him no disease took his life he decided to go how about that it's people go oh no you you can't choose with this day or not yes I can I can choose that it's up to him when I go but I don't want to go I'm not missing anything I'm not missing anything he's gonna do on this earth as long as he wants me to here be here I'm staying and one day I want you to plan to come here I'm just letting you know that I'll just show up I walked through the wall I've been here on the blackboard in heaven they have no time I want to live that way I want to be just like them let us make man in our image and after all excuse me I've been talking so much I don't know where I left my water I think it's on the floor that's somewhere I'll be sharing about this a little bit but I just got back from Hollywood and I talked non-stop I did make some side meetings so I'm not even talking about the meetings I did I'm talking about the producer I met with [Music] God is taking Hollywood I mean seriously he is taking it and he'll is terrified no he'll can get mad but the time will come when they get so afraid of you you become dangerous well I'm dangerous and when I go in somewhere in Hollywood they run out they won't they won't they can't stand to be near me they don't want to be near me they will burn like they will literally burn and they'll feel the pain I'm of sure one day says make them feel the pain and on the back will be a devil and they'll be going like this I want to share a couple things though before I actually start because I almost never do this but we actually have some new things we're in Phase two of what God called me to do the first whole half not half the first season I had in doing this was to reveal heaven to earth the second season is to create heaven on earth that season will be much longer than the first one it's still a way to reveal it but why not be able to hold it or wear it or sit on it or watch or have it in your walls or have it in your floors heaven is invading literally invading people's lives everywhere in ways that we maybe not expect one of it is going to be the movie industry and so God is making us extremely bold about what we say so there's no question when you're in that arena you need to make sure there's no question about who you represent I'm gonna make that perfectly clear and then the Holy Spirit always gives us new little we call them Kingdom quotes but they're actually Holy Spirit quotes he makes me save him I purpose because he likes to hear them and our newest one is I don't do demons in case hell should wander by we want to make sure they remember the day they were kicked out with a lightning bolt which is right in the middle there you go bring back back back to the remembrance in case they forgot so this is a car magnet we don't do traditional bumper stickers just can go on your car and it's huge [Laughter] it does get looks we just released it about a month ago we have buttons that you can wear and talk about you want to make a conversation just wear one and walk somewhere and people love especially in our country they love to read any kind of a sign or button you're wearing or t-shirt or cap that you have to see what it says they literally have to see it and I've seen people follow people down the street so they can finally read the bumper sticker so now they see this and right along with this one we have other ones we have one that says roll up your wraps your rug and rule okay so right there's I don't do demons roll up your rapture rug and rule there you go what does that mean one of my staff said why don't we just say roll up your wraps are there every Baptists on the earth could be so mad at us they'd be thrown things out so we got to say why okay why number one it is not time for the rapture right now we haven't occupied that means take Dominion take Dominion deucey do something powerful with your life I will I'd I had to read an entire movie script in 20 hours because I will be editing it thank God Margaret was with me and this can be powerful not like anything you have seen on this earth anywhere not anywhere at all and so we also have along with the census since this is the Holy Spirit's favorite quote right now we also have a cup cozies and if I can get it on here I might it does if it fits water bottles but it also fits cups and then make it fit this one now nobody has these yet it also says I don't do demons take your water bottle to work set it around you will stir up things so these are brand new and everything we have is made in America since I'm going to market this okay this is sewn on two sides but it lays flat for traveling we plan to take hundreds of these overseas with us and and it says they don't do demons and on the back is where you can find out more revealing heaven calm and the Holy Spirit picks the colors everything he wanted to make sure you could see this a mile away okay so this is another thing we've got right here we we have we have gone back because we used to have these when I first started we didn't have any maintenance so we've had some new ones made it does have the book cover on it revealing heaven we'll have a book to also have one with its colors and when I get booked three them will do that this is also made in America this opens and shuts it does not come off and this however you get it off you snap it off but look how hard that is this double double pane double insulated made in America dishwasher safe microwave-safe how about that and yeah for hot or cold and it works we've tested all of our own stuff so I love that we can put maybe this is our newest one it literally just came out hey we made this thing as big as the magnet are you kidding 22 ounces I don't do jima that's good because this one is yours and I love the colors we make sure everything matches well you know the Holy Spirit doesn't like a lot of clutter on things because they want you to see what it's sayin right and so this is our newest one we literally just got them I love them and because we're making a statement this is what the Holy Spirit said you're making a statement about who you are and what you stand for without blasting any other denomination or religion you're literally can safely if you care make a statement about what you believe in what you don't tolerate and people are sowing dunks they've never seen anything like this before you know it's either something very liberal or demonic or you might have a cross on something but God is into saying very plainly what he means and this means you are not partnering nor tolerating nor participating with darkness of any kind whatsoever and so people have to say well what does that mean well I just tell them that means I torment demons that's what it means and then I quote a scripture you know this is what this means this is our privilege in this time as the body of Christ you know God had his time when he kicked him out of heaven right when they were all became evil and then Jesus had his time when he wasted hell on the third day and melted the faces of the principalities and powers in hell stripped their leader of everything took every gemstone off that God put on him and took the keys of hell death in the break so guess who gets the third show we do God said oh it's the show he said I am a show person all the way I was the first show man in the center ring when I kicked all those all those demonic angels out that they rose up against me he said there was light lightning bolt there was action they went down there was lights and there was action ok this is the Sun in hell all darkness you know ready for by the way Satan was planning a show by the way if you didn't know that he was Satan was planning a show himself to torture the Son of God in front of all of his demons and he actually called in the principalities and powers because they don't stay in Hell they are seated on Thrones on dark Thrones all around this world so he called them in to hell to the courtyard of Hell where he was going to put the show on well guess what the Son of God put the show on and it says so in the Bible he spoiled ruined principalities and powers and made a show of it openly triumphing in it I call that a show there was lights the fire of God coming out of his hands there was action the melting faces of the principalities and there was a lot of noise the demons screaming now we get to manifest and demonstrate for him in this earth doing supernatural signs and wonders the greater works stunning hell and shocking this world so whether you knew it or not you're the 3rd show how about that so we like to make things that are you know preparing for the show right I'm wearing this pin that I wore the first time it was in 2016 early in 2016 when the elections well the the campaigning was going on and it says let the show begin and it has begun don't totally begun these are these coasters the ones that are made out of the pressed whatever that is they can get wet and then they drown you reuse them reuse them this is the weather warriors which we also are kind of still in charge of them what are the weather warriors we tell the weather what it cannot do we're not we're not stopping the weather we're stopping the destruction of Hell getting in the weather when God created weather for this earth he did not create it to be destructive it was a nourish and replenish the earth in the winter it was to cover up like the earth thrust right and and it does a lot of other things like kill the insects and the bugs unfortunately in Florida we don't get a lot of snow we didn't get a lot we don't get a lot of that down there but other places have it so God designed this earth to operate in a certain way but since there's a wicked evil being who hates everyone and including the earth here he has tried to take over himself and yet the Bible clearly says Jesus gave us power this is not my message yet this is my introduction the word clearly says that Jesus said to all believers I give you power over the power of the enemy so this is using that power right here God did did not design hurricanes himself Satan gets involved in that and gets controlling them he wants to kill steal and destroy and he will use that in any form of whether he can while we're stopping it yes we have a right because Jesus said we were joint heirs what he did we can do he stopped to storm people we actually do that and there's a whole lot of people we now call them the weather warrior so God had us design a logo God is into images trust me this is another logo almost everything we have it's either a logo or it's the beginning of a move of God because I don't get to do anything that's normal okay I'm never gonna be normal not ever another thing we have the right to do is to command the host of heaven some of you may have a problem with this don't be concerned about commanding the host of heaven that would be the army of heaven and and God loves that army he designed them to war for us they are not protecting heaven they never have protected heaven they don't need to protect heaven the one who made them is on the throne so they've never stopped people from coming up into heaven and taking things okay although somebody translated that word you know about the kingdom of heaven suffering violence they think that means that people from earth are going up there and stealing things that literally came out of a Bible translation it really did I don't know how they got that I don't know where that even came from okay that scripture has a revelation to it the scripture is from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force is that correct is that what that scripture says well everybody's focusing on the word suffers because they don't understand although scripturally there is another meaning for that and the Holy Spirit showed me think of this scripture suffer the little children to come unto me now does that mean the little children are being attacked say no does that mean that he's saying cause the little children to come unto me encourage the little children to come unto me so let's put that word in the other scripture from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven encourages and causes spiritual violence to rise up on the inside of you so you the believer can take it by force from the enemy now that scripture makes sense doesn't it because it does not mean the other thing there's literally no way anyone's gonna get up to heaven without God's permission amen they want us to be spiritually violent that word is that means passionately violent against the spiritual darkness don't tolerate them don't participate with them and there's another scripture that clearly says that our weapons of warfare are not natural they are not physical but they are spiritual they say the word day they are supernatural and spiritual weapons and they pull down what what kind of strongholds are they pulling down they pull down principalities right and strongholds of darkness is that right that sounds like an army to me an army we've almost been totally ignoring for a very long time and yet they were created by God for us to be over angels are not over us it says in the times to come we will judge them does that say that the Bible so if we're going to judge them then they can't be over us is that correct we have some authority over them we cannot worship them but commanding if you look in the dictionary if you look at the word commanding it does not mean worship it does not mean we're worshipping but I happen to known the military must have orders I've had so many members of my family in the military including my husband was in the Marine Corps they cannot work on their own can you imagine them running out of boot camp taking weapons they barely not go in attacking things does that happen do they have to have orders from headquarters even when they're overseas they have somebody over them that has to give them orders heavens army is no different I have news to me even though there's an army that army cannot leave their bitters in heaven attack whoever they feel like that's not going to happen they have to have orders they operate by orders they harpin under the word of the lord so that means you're not going to move this army unless he lives in you and he operates through you they're gonna listen to anybody else but there had to come a time on this earth in order for them to fulfill their destiny that we could send them on missions ourselves are we joint heirs with Christ was he the Lord of Hosts did he command heavens army is that our right then why aren't we doing it well I know you are now but every time I introduce the army of heaven I always have to go through this preparation for people that never considered in their head they know what praying to Jesus they ask Jesus to send help but if we're like them and they create we can create if they come in weak in command is that right it is always his power that does it we don't do anything without Christ we don't get anything we can't have anything we can't just choose to do stuff on our own even in the same way we don't operate without Christ that army cannot operate without commanders back in 2014 I was shown millions of the army of heaven being sent to this earth and they were waiting 2014 the father introduced me to the army of heaven and taught me how to command them from that day I have not ever been attacked I am never sick they were made to keep us and protect us in all our ways the Angels we have with us all the time they're sent at the time of our conception at the time we are conceived they are sent I see them all the time waiting outside pregnant mothers those angels I know where hers are those angels that are waiting you're waiting for that baby to be born that's when you have guardian angels they don't just come to you and get a certain age they're there with you your entire life they have already got their orders from the Father they know boundaries that they have they know what they were sent there for the army has another purpose they are sent to attack and destroy the plans of the dark armies Satan has an army too it's not as big it's not as well organized it does not love each other they hate each other they kind of do what they wanted they get punished a lot but God's army cares about each other they work well together they are fierce against the darkness they don't ever abandon their post they're very destructive they operate in the spirit realm wherever you send them wherever there is darkness whether it was evil wherever there is violence you can send them there this earth is going to change drastically when the body of Christ finally stops fighting it arguing with it not wanting to do anything with it because they're afraid their lives are going to change especially in this time on the earth when God is boldly gonna have a step forth and start doing things okay and going places where they never wanted to go before you send the army before you all the strongholds are pulled down and we just had friends that just witnessed that I kept telling them they go on these missions trips all over Korea and the last time all the reporter was how many times they got attacked how many people were put in hospitals the own people in the hospital how many places they got rejected in places already agreed to have them come and I said when they were done but you did send the army right we forgot so when they went this year they sent me a text we have sent our army every one of us we are given them very specific detailed orders and every place we go they'll go there first they'll be there while we're there we don't expect a no holdups delays incidents accident sicknesses nothing of any kind happen every time they went to I forgot how many like 2030 cities they went to Korea I got a report every time every single time they were going to know that they know they sent the army not one incident not in their travel not in their protection not in the places they stayed in not the cities they went to there were so many miracles and souls one and the joy of it all they had any interference from the devil not one not one not one they want me to come back right away so that I can again teach and train their entire congregation how to command their own army from heaven that will live over your home in the sky they do not go back to heaven they are assigned by heaven to you people walk down my street look over my home all the time they can see beings there all the time don't look for somebody that looks like you those are Gabriel's group Gabriel's group look like humans except they have wings sometimes they hide them there on a Centon assignment on the earth could get easily move around amongst us the hosts of heaven would not be able to do that someone have six-inch years coming out of every pore of their being some are the weapon themselves they have 18 eyes okay they're made out of every kind of form of substance you can think of they could not easily move amongst us people would call them aliens and probably have in the past they're creatures almost every one of them are creatures creatures are in heaven they're ones that look like what we call part human part animal the living creatures don't get freaked out I'll give you proof the living creatures around the throne do not look like humans they have massive heads that are curved like this I know when people say they've seen them because that's what their heads are shaped like the one like a lion the one like an eagle the one like an ox the one that has the face of a man does not look like Jesus Christ because you have wonder they have eyes in their heads in the back of their heads and every one of their six wings they have hooves golden hooves for their feet they walk upright they have these gossamer gowns on that make a frequencies and they're about 80 to 100 foot tall every one of them are fierce don't go up to heaven try to make friends with them and the two that hold up the arms of the throne are even more weird they each have four heads they would not easily mix with people on the earth God has planned every design of every being he has ever made including you he knew what your face would look like before he made you before you were on the earth you got your body in heaven you were a little spiritual being some different sizes about this biggest different sizes you are made out of light you lived in him you moved in and out of him on the Rays of his rainbow that was the only place they could go move in and out they played inside they played in the River of Life that's where you were that's where you came from that's why he is your father that's why you are his sons and daughters you are says you are his offspring so anyone reunion if you have children let me see your hands are your children your offspring did the mother carry those offspring yes so she nurtured them right she carried them she had water in her womb so they would feel like it was a familiar place because inside the father is the river of life we played in it we moved in it that's where you lived you lived in the river of life you played on the stones of fire that's why we like sparkly things the stone sapphire huge gemstones inside the father you've jumped on them you played on them you slid down this mountain this powerful mountain that is inside the father you'd slide down the river of life you jump off the gem stones into the river of life and that's where you played so when you made the womb of a woman he put water in it so while you were growing inside you wouldn't be afraid we couldn't leave his presence and live somewhere in heaven you have not lived on the earth before some people believe all kinds of crazy things you didn't come to the earth until he sent you here he knit you together in your mother's womb when he took that little spirit of life from himself sent it by the Holy Spirit at the time of conception he knit it and attached it to that dot of flesh that is when life begins he sent you from himself he made this whole earth this physical realm just so he could send you here and you could have a body that's how well he plans he knows every day of your life he planned good things for you not the bad there's the evil being here named Satan some people think even he does not excuse me I've been to hell and I've seen him he hates everybody but himself his plan is to wipe you out every way he can anytime you can and right now powerful powerful children are being sent to this earth for the years that are starting on this earth some of the greatest leaders in the body of Christ they're still being born he needed him here now so he timed your birth on the earth you are wonderfully and perfectly made you carry parts of his image outside and inside how did I get all this information because I've been caught up to heaven non-stop since 1996 I didn't ask for that I don't I don't know how to tell you to get that Commission I was given the Commission I don't decide when I go how long I Stay I don't decide what I go see he does I come from many generations of believers who were sold out in love with Jesus Christ many of them had encounters with him but even the ones that didn't he never step back and they went forward in their life they touch this earth impacted this earth with their life never stopped loving God never stopped trusting him never ever ever ever I'm seventh generation I should be different I was not raised normally like a lot of people were I knew who God was from the time I could before I could walk I remember even laying in his hand when he was sitting on the throne he was talking to me I was about this big like this like a little like I was and even at that time this I know they say you know the sex of the child was determined in certain ways down here but let me tell you he wrote on your soul what you would be because he determined who he needed you to be male or female there is no other choice on your will on your will your will which is one of those powerful things you have I'm still not starting yet who here does not know but human soul looks like we see your hands if you don't know literally how it's made you know what your mind your will and your emotions but do you know what those things look like he showed me back in 2010 he showed me I have a photographic memory which comes in really handy with what I do cuz I've remembered every single time my mistake in heaven he showed me the human soul because he's gonna release something that would change the body of Christ forever and that's exactly what he said to me when they learn how to really guard their soul they can cause it to prosper their self when they get their soul to prosper they will always prosper and they will live in divine health so I am never sick because I order my soul accordingly I let no darkness in I don't watch anything that belongs I don't read it I don't watch it and I don't say it and I don't listen to it either it says guard your heart that is your soul you know the heart the word heart means something more than this thing is it on this side I forget this beating thing is not what he's talking about guard your heart is not about this heart it's this one the very core of your being in your spirit man is where your soul is guard that fraud will flow the way you live your life the issues of life for out of this soul that you have inside you will determine how you live your life as a man thinketh in his soul so is he so if you don't like you you can change it if you don't like things happening to you you can change that too if you don't like the atmosphere in your home you can change that too according to what you say what you think how you order your life can change your life when Adam was laying there not alive and God blew the Father the word was with him the word was always with him when they created that's why you can say talking of the word there's nothing that was made that was not made by him well how come the father was there they worked together all the time God spoke it the word made it that's how it works whenever the father said the word that's why it was his name would make it they were always together so they were together in the garden the word made Adam but he was missing something he wasn't alive he needed his spirit his little spirit man that had lived in God all that time kept him knew who he would become he leaned over and breathed that little spirit man these fear of life from inside himself or he had been living into Adams nostrils and then he said Adam has become a living soul that's very important that was now saying because we had souls wanted living in God we just didn't really need them because your soul you decide where you're gonna live what you're gonna say what you're gonna wear what you're gonna eat we didn't have to decide any of that when we lived him he was our home he was our very existence so he gave us something to wear right he nurtured us he's called the many breasted one he took care of us the whole time we were with him it says that in the Bible that just meant that he would comfort us he would hold us he would love us it does say that in the Bible depending on translation you get some of the newer ones I don't know what for if it says that or not but it does say that about him no matter how your father your physical one treated you on this earth he is your real father so your soul is very key to your very existence most of the time I grew up in church think I was born there practically we went every meeting we had in the churches that we attended and and I learned a lot I listened a lot I learned a lot but they never really told me what my soul was for except that it was not good almost every statement made it's dark man designs and desires bad things and things and bad things and well maybe if they choose that they do you know to a five-year-old don't know how darker could be and I would sit there on that pew and this is what I would think how could they say that I meet from God I'm light I carry light how can my soul be bad they just don't know something they just don't know this is at five I would think about those things my soul has to be good Jesus lives in it cuz I got born again 84 well no my souls not bad my cell no I think on the things of God No mine is not we need to find out why our solace for it's got to be important he didn't make spare parts and if they say it's my mind my will and my emotions that pretty much I could do nothing without it so he decided to literally show me and in 2010 he caught me up to heaven show me this is a human soul and the very core of your being is your will it looks like a column it is a column it's a strong column with writings on it that God Himself wrote on before he sent you here he wrote things on it no man can literally say and mean it that there is no God they lie or they don't know but they cannot say that or even really convince yourself even atheists when they get saved say I always knew there was something he wrote on your will and then attached to that will is your mind not your human brain your human brain is just kind of wrapped around that mind because when you die you still think when you step out of that physical body and you're in your spirit body you think you have emotions you make choices you'd be pretty bored in heaven if you couldn't your soul goes with you your body gets separated your soul stays with your spirit man you have your favorite places in heaven you have your favorite foods in heaven so that soul stays with you all the time it just fed all day long your physical body gets fed three times day unless you like to snack a lot in foreign countries eat twice a day America its three times with dessert and snacks but your spirit man your soul is sped all day long and if you play stuff at night it's fed at night what are you feeding you everything you see everything you hear everything you read and what you say yourself you feed other people's souls when you say certain things your into them I'm I'm feeding you everybody's soul right now your soul is taking it in you have layers in your soul it gets stored in there if there's ever anything you really forgot you need to remember just tell God that I need my soul I need to know from the files of my soul I need that I need that I said it till one time and in front of me sitting in my desk I needed a little scrap of paper pastor had written his name and phone number down he was gonna invite me to come and I lost it but I looked at it first I had read it looked at it read I knew the same shape and size of that piece of paper and it was stored in my soul this was like 2 years later when I can't find it I need it I know they want me to comment on one thing I'm ignoring them and when I said ok see my soul show it to me in front of me came this piece of paper out in the spirit it literally it literally just like this came out like this and I could see it it was the same piece of paper I had looked at because it's stored in you and he said write it down cleric it's gonna go back in there so get my pen I am writing as fast as I can I was so excited it didn't go like this flip flip now that is wonderful if it's something good but if you have horrible traumas that is also stored in your soul people get tormented for years about the things they had to witness or see it wasn't even anything they had to do with you don't have to keep it anything in your soul you don't want you loose it with the keys to the community you know what that says write the keys of the kingdom what you loose on earth does that mean you're going to keep it if you loose it nope and we always thought the keys at the kingdom wants to bind the devil they do a lot of things actually but what I was taught for the father that day was how to get stuff out of your soul whether it was addictions any kind of addiction trauma violent acts words that were said that you don't wanna remember those words they hurt they wound wounds out of your soul it doesn't matter what it is witchcraft practice against you it's gone gone gone angry hateful words offense and forgetting us gone God said I don't have six months for people I don't have six months for them to be healed anymore you can lose spirits of infirmity sickness and disease from your soul and it's gone and I just happened to glance in my clock and then he caught me up to heaven and he showed me the human soul then he started telling me one thing after another for another they can lose Cistus this assists this this this all this stuff all this stuff all this stuff they can choose to loose it and it we can't take it out remember it's loosed from heaven then you bind the things of God to your soul and this really changes how you live you think and you act you can actually say and now I choose with my will to bind to my soul the life of God the love of God the presence of God the plans and purposes of God from my life his creativity his celebration his expectation you get so filled with God and no one can take it out it's part of that abundant life and it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter how long ago you experienced things you can even lose things from your children Souls if they're not adults yet we've already had testimonies there's people being in the congregations you lay your hand on their head as the covering of their soul I chooses my will to lose from my child so every bit of the bullying that they Oaks means all the hateful mean disgusting vile critical words spoken over my child I choose to lose them from their soul right now haven't come down pulls them out it's like it never happened and kids go on happy like it never happened instead of being affected sometimes for a very long time like if you try out for something and you reject it sometimes it hurts children just loose it we have kids are doing on their own we have 10 year olds that command armies up from heaven because they didn't argue about doing it those 10 year olds are certainly not worshiping their commanding what do they do they command them to go to their school and protect every student there to stop all violence from coming into their zoo to pull down strongholds of Satan rising against the school too potent on strongholds trying to convince them that there's something different than they are you choose that's why he gave you a will that's why he will not control people Satan controls he'll be happy to take your will and do whatever he wants to with it and if you put enough of him in it you're gonna act like him is that right you choose with yourself who are you going to serve you choose each day am I going to choose life or death there's a lot of that going on in this election and a lot of people are choosing death that's not God God wants us to live and live more abundantly amen tomorrow night I'll be talking about America and Trump 2020 [Music] [Applause] but God has told me I think he knows amen he on purpose has chosen America to be a pattern that even other government leaders of other countries can choose to pattern their ways after America I remember I travel a whole lot in 2017 and I would meet up people from all over the world I never knew never met them they'd all come up to me and say you must be an American you have pink hair we don't have that here but we want to know what do you think about your president because what we've been hearing on the news we cannot possibly believe it could be true but he's already visited our country and encouraged our leaders we already know that business is booming in America we know he's creating jobs for that country we hope our leader becomes just like him but we want to know what do you think I said well I think 80percent of America loves him that's why they voted him in and by the way stop watching CNN I think the fake news doesn't like us either and I'd have these long discussions with these people never knew and these were like medical doctors I mean really leaders in their own community and it probably did from eight different countries and they all asked me the same thing and they got the same answer so God still has big plans for America you think he's wrapping things up in ten years I don't think so we are just learning to operate and levels of authority that were given to us by Jesus Christ we're just learning to really take authority over the weather because we're over it not under it if we're just learning this why would you wrap everything up this is what God says I will not have a weak pathetic testimony of my son's death and all he gave you I'm not taking anybody anywhere until they're operating like him so why do we do all this everything we do we do because of him we do it with him because of him and for him we're light in this world so if you wonder who to vote for someone who doesn't represent the darkness that does not represent death that cares about what's going on in this world or especially their country and God certainly cares about it he cares about everyone but but we were willing the body of Christ is willing to help God is that right they worshiped him they loved him they honor him what he wants they're willing to do the majority are willing they just don't know what to do some of them and since before pastors weren't allowed to give any help now they are of course you did design the Internet that bypasses everything so God has great plans and the next thing I'm going to show you is really the first time on planet Earth this has ever been done and the father said I'm going to ask you to do something I want it done right away he said I'm going to mark the year that I released for the first time the faces of the hosts of heaven to humanity he said I want you to put them in a calendar you're gonna call it the hosts undercover he said they'd better undercover for a long time but now they won't be because he's serious about crushing hell he does have he has a defined time when time will be no more if you want to know what that means I can tell you that means there'll be no more time to count days and there were no limit to space like in heaven there can be 10 things right here there's layers in heaven so the comet on many earths when time will be no more he will not need this physical and even when that happens it won't be a date it will be an event because God counts things by events the time just happens to fall in every time he does something he does it because of an event so on his timeline he measures his timeline by events that's how he does it so there'll be a certain event at one point when that happens he won't need this earth anymore there will be a new earth made the Bible talks about it some people don't want to even admit that day I don't know what this thing is are afraid to leave it I guess seriously there are whole groups now saying there is we'll just be remade or keeping it I don't think that's scriptural there isn't any they just think he's gonna make it all better it wouldn't be able to hold what he's got playing for us in the new earth you couldn't have put it the new earth will be so huge the very fact that the New Jerusalem will sit on that the earth this earth would go whoop just put this in just with the New Jerusalem honor okay what's that that's God's transport down to the new work that's what it is he's packing up leaving his own home he's always had leaving heaven one day because we will stay in his home for a temporary time when you die and move to heaven that your RNR you get a beautiful mansion you get to do things you never thought of before it's R&R for that place because God intends fully at one time when time as know where he's gonna take all of us and it by belonging to him that we are his put us on a brand new earth and he will pack up his bags get on the New Jerusalem and it will be his transport we will be down here waiting on the new earth for him we will see him coming these are real things that are talked about in the Word of God but people are so stuck where they're at they don't know how much further they can go so they don't really know where they are so they go to what they know they all talk about the tribulation they talk about the Rabb they don't know they talk about doom and gloom because you know the tribulation is doom and gloom right heaven isn't heaven doesn't give you a funeral somebody please have a party when their loved ones go home because that's what they're having in heaven they don't get a funeral in heaven they get a party it's called a celebration the Bible says he celebrates every time one comes home that is a celebration that's a lot different than the funeral it's a funeral would fun after you end so I'm going to show you this we have some back there I don't know how many we have but we're going to give this one to Dave and Dee Dee so they'll make sure they get one he had us create this it was definitely a supernatural thing because I have about 400 pictures of the hosts he actually sent them to me to get pictures of them it if there were a lot of them I took pictures if this is the thing if you didn't want them shown they they collapsed the picture did it was like no definition that's just a flat nothing and I began I said well what's wrong with this one he said no I don't want you to keep that one I'll get another one so perfectly sharp and clear he said you're gonna keep that one I didn't know it was keeping them to make this calendar we're gonna put them on a lot of other things cuz they will inspire you and empower you to know these guys are real and their greatest passion is to war against the darkness they didn't cry when Lucifer was kicked out the day Michael cried Gabriel Michael didn't try they had a party because they were fed up with Lucifer going around tempting their own friends to fall picture in your town and how did God deal with evil he kicked it out he didn't tolerate it he didn't make a place for it he didn't say it's okay you're different he kicked it out he didn't want it there he didn't want to filing heaven anymore it will never be allowed back he is not going to forgive Satan and he is not going to forgive one fallen angel they live with him they got one chance it's up soz about these guys in the unit on the front cover is a being I know I didn't not like this one on purpose sometimes we outlined them to help you in the corner we would show a being like this one then down here we just outlined it in case you couldn't tell because spiritual beings are made different the army especially they don't have a hand like this all of them don't some have a head they have more than one eye or they have one big eye guess what else I cops thing came from the enemy will take anything you can that balloons of God and twist it and defile it he will now Medusa that was his own creation but there's a lot of beings in heaven there's many beings that have like a horse body and beautiful you know there's them is very beautiful they're not evil Satan took the image and made it evil so I'm gonna show you a couple of the pages now this one's very easily seen this is a real fire angel made out of guess what fire and he's a spirit she she's all spiritual being his arms don't come from his shoulders they come from his chest this is his arm this is his whole arm coming out of his body this is his head if you could look at this closer you could see his eyes his nose his mouth this is his wings right here his hair his wings he is walking on legs do you see the legs he's walking on the river in our city and in his hand he's carrying a deposit of the fire of God his name is Inferno and gentes picture it was right after our National Day of Prayer and all the wild intercessors got on a riverboat we wrote up a nun our st. Johns River and we would drop salt in the water salting it and we said on purpose this is to make way to cleanse the water for the fire of God to come and then God sent it so about a month later after that event he showed up on the river we were going over to visit my sister on the other side of the river and he said don't go the way you normally go go this other way or you're gonna miss what I'm gonna send in the sky she's a photographer I'm driving I have to say Jen took this picture I took a lot of them but she did take this one and we were we are miles dropped off when we came over we were on the Express system we came over this part down under where this is this bridge is three miles long as a three mile long bridge that connects to the other side of our city he was walking on the water not not standing he was we got about eight pictures of him and he was kind of white then he started getting more and more fire in him and people were going crazy they were pulling over I mean many pictures got this people got this picture so this is this was one of not the very first one but one of the best that was in 2009 and so I'll show you another one we'll have them back there now these are all army members these are not any of gabriel's I don't have any pictures of Gabriel's I've drawn them I painted them I don't have any pictures god I'm purpose connecting me to the army and so I'll show you another one just kind of passing around here some of them if you ever see something the sky looks like a dragon it's an Eragon they belong to heaven if God told me their name I know what their name is this one right here is there's a whole group there angels are made in tribes both on Gabriel side the first tribes were hid in heaven they weren't angels he made them in tribes because they had a defined purpose every tribe had a defined purpose and this one is the guardian angel over the state of New York his name is Excalibur can you see his face very clearly in the back can you see it oh thank you yeah he looks like a lion you see his mouth up and you can see his Mane yeah he's part of the tribe of the Royal Guard they all look like lions you've seen a lot of lines in the sky it was these guys right here and they do look like they look like lions and they guard the Royals because you are kings and priests into your God so that is their defying purpose they come to guard those who will rule and reign with Christ so that's that's the Royal Guard I also have ones that transport troops from heaven at pictures of the troops of heaven have pictures of one that goes into as covert and he he videotapes the actions of darkness and he goes right up to Michael's throne Michaels building he has one eye okay this is this is that angel its name is scout because he's a scout he goes behind the lines you should be able to see the one big eye it's right here you see a mark on that angel see that mark next to his eye it's a mark like a tattoo God marks the enemy stole it that's God's thing he marks them with different marks and this one right here is literally going like this looking and watching activities of Hell's army who are clueless to what they're doing they are absolutely clueless and so he's standing in a cloud in his wings or other army members of the hosts to protect them from any attacks of the enemy and so God has really good plans so this is a scout host of hosts of heaven with one eye right here if you could see a close you could literally see a face on the eye it records and this is something he asked us to create we didn't choose to do it ourselves I'm gonna show you another one oh we actually entry on here like here a roll up your Raptor rug and roll up you're out for rock and in here we have things like don't forget to ask for grace for today and then we have special days we put a special days in here we don't have Halloween so sorry we took it out we took liberties we don't have holidays from other false religions either so get used to it and so then we put statements at the bottom each the Holy Spirit gave us you must choose to be chosen you know that thing God many are called but few are chosen is because they didn't choose to be chosen you choose it you choose to be chosen this one is one of the best ones we have his name is Rex yeah it's it's me do you see his face he looks like a lion he's high up in the command of the Royal Guard really high up he's got wings that come from his neck my son-in-law likes to say he has horns and I want one no he didn't really have horns those are wings and I can't do this as well so my turn around this is one wing and this is another one and there's eyes lining there's eyes in all these wings eyes he has the eye on the end of his beard this is his moustache can you see his moustache it's long isn't that people say do angels have beards and mustaches the answer is yes you can see them right here he's holding a scroll on his hand can you see the scroll this is the scroll has a face it's a living scroll his name is Justus that scroll was dropped inside of me I had to say yes because I was said during the time when when we would command and the scrolls name is Justus and God said that he would read himself to me would that bother you've got to ask you that what would you say that's well I actually had to say yes my husband was with me somebody who never sees angels he's got five layers of a soul he's Scottish he's like a mountain he can't be moved anywhere he just belong to Jesus but he was with me when this beam came in over five storeys of condos and when spiritual beings come in the physical realm they flatten they come in and then they open up we have pictures of him flattened coming in we had pictures of him fully open we have pictures of him just waiting and then I asked the Holy after I got nuns screaming and yelling my husband's like oh something's coming in that was his whole statement something's coming in I'm like I'm excited I'm so excited wonder what he's here for a wonder what he wants and so I saw the spirit what is he here for was he's got orders from headquarters during the army from heaven for you to command and I said what I do he says you have to say I receive the scroll so I said I received it he dropped it and went inside of me and I said well whatever do he said nothing it'll read itself to you scrolls in heaven books in heaven read themselves to you so this is normal for heaven this is what happens when you live supernatural this is what happens when you choose to live the way God designed you to be amen and so we have heard him say one word and there's another picture after this I don't have that with me but after he dropped the scroll out of this this rift this deep blue is heaven right there that's heaven and when I said yes and you dropped inside of me out of these came two more beings one had a shofar one had a trumpet they began to blow them because God was signifying something the earth was going to command the army and so that's what that signified if I had said no it might have changed things or he would have found someone else I wasn't willing to do that amen so I have that picture you literally see these beings one looks very ancient he's got a long beard his eyes a rectangle and he's got a shofar the other one has a trumpet trumpet he's just got like a big like a I can't remem what you call those things capes or woods whatever you want to call that he had something like that and they were there celebrating then they were gone like that so we had a very little time I said I'm taking pictures I don't know about you I'm taking pictures to get some pictures of it so this is what's in this calendar and every month it has something to encourage you and the hosts make toast may the hosts go with you we say that to people all the time stand up stand out be dangerous against hell but this is not your normal calendar okay and over here what we know about that being we will tell you if we know something about it right there will tell you and and on the back he had us actually we couldn't hide who we are I said you're gonna show who you are so this is about a company one quest international tells you what it is there's me there's Margaret and then we have another page you said you're also going to show the creative team I sent all this through so people know who helped to create it because I don't do everything by myself there I am there's our our very funny English guy there's Jan okay in about two weeks we had it done do you ever work in any kind of marketing or creating that's that's definitely that's a heaven thing we stayed up we traveled we worked on it in the hotel room the hardest part was was picking out we just put all these pictures out everywhere we took them with us and then and God gave us what to say push back darkness I mean this whole thing is about God it's all about heaven it's about God's time on the earth and there's a there's others so there's one for each month in here and people go what the years have to over yet but they're not done this is about a time it's about a time like God counts event by events this is an event that God had picked scrolls were literally open and heaven unlocked and open so the host could work with us to fulfill their destiny that they were created to war for us so that's my introduction and we will have some back there if we if we know the name some look pretty fierce but these guys war you think about they war just like a military they're warring for you they fight for you literally for you for your family they'll keep the darkness as long as you're not bringing in your home they'll keep it out of your home amen and so these are some of our products our cups this is just our book cover of book 1 that's what that is and eventually we'll have whole sets of cups made like with some of the hosts on them that you can get you can go to revealing heaven dot-com and they'll all be on all those will be online yeah our phone numbers on our website you can call it if you can't find something you can call it and so um yeah our events are planned for specific purposes that we have our own there to train people to be prepared to be a part of a move of God like we have for the first time we're going to be training whether Warriors at our event at the end this next weekend actually it's called heavens invitation and we've had every year since we've been going and now we're adding weather warriors as one of the whole days to be trained how do you train how you learn too because you know Jesus already knew all that when he was asleep in the boat he already knew he could do that he was hoping the disciples would learned from him and yet what did they do there they're in terror for their own life there's a lord of glory on the boat with him and he's sleeping I'm sure you wanted to say why didn't you handle it when he learned to multiply the food he was training them the whole time why didn't you multiply food we can go and buy it we can't fine well why didn't you multiply it I mean disciples he wanted them to learn what he did why don't you traveling through the spirit realm will fill up God it Philip did as a lifestyle it was so normal for him he just did it you don't try it you do only purpose and focus and you keep doing it and something is going to happen and he doesn't care if you're ninety nine or nine it's what you choose what you decide you want but wherever you don't don't reject it sometimes it's Jesus just taught them something he didn't say what do you want this or not he just did it it's up to you if you do it or not amen and this new time we're living in the earth where we will demonstrate the power of the Living God we're not waiting on that time we're in that time you weren't here the last time I was here I just got back from Reno where I walked on the air who wants to do that be passionate about it I didn't even walk on water first I know Jesus said the books I did you will do and greater works you will do I jumped right into the greater works you know why that happened because I was violently passionate about something I had just hit my foot under stone and I roared this should not have happened to me I will not tolerate this again your word says that the angels will catch me up so I don't even - my foot on a stone I will never do that again and so next the week after I'm in Reno and between the green room and where we were there was a drop-off this big I walked right off of it I didn't even think I didn't know I was walking in here but I had said that and this the floor of a stone that was really humor I think on their part I said it wouldn't - stop and literally I don't know if they caught me I don't know what they did I don't know what they did I just know I didn't hit it I didn't fall on it I didn't hit it my foot didn't get dashed my head didn't get - it was like so high I would have fallen my whole body would have been I just walked like it was nothing I'm just doing the father's business right the pastor's in front of me walking and talking and I'm just walking and talking behind him and gents are shelling you're floating in air and what no I'm not I had my iPad or holding my iPad and I'm just talking to the pastor she says yes you are yes you are you know I thought she was playing a joke on me or something so I just keep walking I'm walking I walked out about 6 foot she goes you are walking on air why don't you look down so I'm walking outside I went I threw my iPad and I was there for about three more seconds just so he knew I would never forget that I was walking out here and I just went down really slow I began shaking Jen we were shaking and the pastor owns what just happened jingles she was flirting and he's a really good friend he said that's awesome will you do it out in the congregation why you just walk off that platform sweetie I want you to walk out that place son the whole time I'm when I first looked down and went wow it was this like walking on water and the father said oh no Jesus could feel the water he knew water was there didn't have anything to do but he said he could feel the water you couldn't feel the air no I couldn't say that's a greater work okay and he said well I'll get used to it until everybody they better start getting used to it everybody say I receive it this is definitely a different time we can't we can't think the same if you stay in your old mindset that's where you'll be when you either die and go to heaven or get raptured if you're gonna live for a couple hundred more years you'll probably get raptured if not then you're probably just going to go there and I've been shown a lot in the future and we're just starting into something so powerful the next 50 years will be so powerful on this very powerful I have grandchildren that are already being caught up to heaven it will be normal for children to visit heaven normal especially if their parents are believers it's gonna be normal he describes it all the time things that I've seen that I never even told him about okay he was three when it started rota volcano or the lava of a volcano with my father who lives in heaven and with Jesus huh he'd never met my father he called him grandpa but my dad looks 25 and he said and he gave me some Mary Janes he didn't know where Mary Jane was maybe somebody's you don't know either my dad's favorite candy in heaven he was giving him candy what do grandparents do they give candy so they still get to heaven he was with him and they were gonna ride this volcano and he was telling his mom all this and she said you better get over here right now get over here I said what did you expect what's gonna happen and so he's telling me all this Indy goes you know what and a three year old would not know even how a volcano was well he said there was lava it was red it was like kind of burning like and he said you know this mount was really cool grandpa took us straight up the side of the mountain no wheels on his car we we just kind of glided up to the top in the mountain we jumped off and went inside the volcano he said you know what my mom he said that would have burned anybody else to death but because of my god we didn't burn we wrote on and it was a fun ride and he you know what he's seven now and it hasn't stopped he'll preach to anybody anything he talks to his army he asked for grace every day and he looses stuff from his soul they don't ever have meltdowns in their car because as soon as they can talk she teaches him how to ask for credits this is our life this is this is our life this is how we're supposed to be living we're not from this world we live here worse we'll be acting like the world we come from amen so it's already starting it's already starting you know I have three daughters they see they hear I told them they had two and they're a girl might you won't sin because you don't get a choice I'm not letting you guys not letting you he said he needed holy seed in this earth and I gave up myself to get married and have you hi this is their conversation when they're little just looking at me I expect you to do greater things than I do and my grandchildren will be even greater so you will have nine children [Laughter] people don't tell you kiss him it's better than the screaming telling there'll be nothing in their dumb they never thought they were that they never thought they were those things and if someone told me they said oh no I'm not I belong to Jesus Christ one day when we had everything we owned taken away from us not our fault thrown out of our home we packed everything up we picked our kids up in a moving van and my daughter who is 16 said to me what an adventure with God I cannot wait to see what is he gonna do with us I am so excited she's 16 raise him up in the admonition of the Lord train them up in the gifts that God gave them and they'll never depart from those gifts the advance had never stopped they never ran in the world I'm serious never ran in the world trying to figure out who they were they knew they were dancers that was what he made them it was their passion from the time they were three four and eight that's all they ever did they didn't want to be something else they knew they were a gift sent from heaven and that's the gift they were every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of you were those lights why would he say that why would he put that in the same thing why would he say that together every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights you were the lights your spare man's made out of light you were a gift he sent you it's not that hard that's God to give you revelation I want you to enjoy your life I want you to celebrate your life you choose every day to be happy you're not happy there's no excuse to not be happy you don't have to keep that junk in you so stand up we're gonna do it I know you've done it again we're gonna do it i'ma pray over you and I'm gonna let you go amen I know there's new people here if you don't know about a soul checkup it's a lifestyle it is a lifestyle it will keep you so full of God so happy so inspired it opens up portals of heaven over you you get witty ideas and inventions you can even share it with others to help them because you have a will you can do this you have a soul he gave it to you you decide to use it or not using I'm not forcing anyone you say yes or no you do it or you don't do it it's really easy because almost everything God ever gave us is some he talks to me like I'm eight he doesn't give me big words he doesn't give me any long you know any long definitions on stuff he keeps it really simple that's why eight-year-olds can read my book and if they follow me and they come to a meeting they won't want their own they don't want to share it with their parents and their parents we'll play there's over 400 hours of me speaking on YouTube a lot of them played me all night long and those kids love it they wander no truth they want to know who God is no one can tell them there's something else because what you fill yourself with you will become amen so this is so simple you're gonna choose with your will to do this first you're gonna choose and say I choose my will to lose from my soul and then I'll give a list of most things that people have in their souls if I don't say something you can say it yourself you can also lose soul ties you made with other people that didn't treat you nice so good you can loose them from your soul then when we're all done because I see Jesus come down and he pulls things out of you literally it's like grey matter he pulls it out and then you bind things of God and they come in waves each thing you say it comes in a wave and I feel it go through me and through everybody here like the love of God the life I feel it comes like a wave so here we go are you ready you say as a child of God I choose with my will to lose from my soul all anger and wrath all hate all critical harsh judgmental words whether they were spoken to me or I spoke them I choose to lose from my soul all witchcraft whether I watched it read it or practiced it or anyone practice it around me I loose it i loosed from my soul all addictions from a person a place or a thing I will not keep any of them they will no longer control me in any way I loose from my soul any in all violence whether I watched it whether I read it whether I spoke it or someone spoke to me I also lose all traumas whether I experience violence or abuse of any kind or a witnessed it I loose all of it in Jesus name I loose from my soul all sadness all oppression depression and all despair any suicidal thoughts I loose them all in Jesus name I loose from my soul all sickness or disease are spirits of infirmity anything that is terminal in my body all emotional pain physical pain or mental pain I loose it all in Jesus name I loose from my soul all confusion any confusion any strife of any kind I will not keep it I lose from my soul all fear of any kind I will not be fearful in any way at least from my soul any lack any poverty mentality any mishandling of money I loose it from my soul I loose it from my soul all darkness I will not participate I will not tolerate and I will not advertise darkness of any kind at least from my soul and also ties there were negative abusive critical hateful or controlling I sever them and loose them from myself and Jesus name I list from my soul any books of other religions I will not keep them in myself I will not allow them to control my will my mind our my emotions no matter how long it's been since I read them or if others read them to me if I attended places that taught false religions I will not participate with an antichrist spirit I lose from my soul and you know deception whether I took it or gave it out I will not take it or keep it I loose it from myself in Jesus name I declare it amen amen and [Music] so now I choose with my will to bind to my soul the love of God the life of God the presence of God the peace of God the celebration of God the creativity of God the expectancy of God I bind those to my soul happiness joy everlasting I bind those to my soul and Jesus name Amen amen amen father I thank you for your children tonight god I thank you for those who received you knows who may not have received I thank you that these words that they have listened to are already in their soul I think you remind them day and night what was said to them what you said to them what your plans are for them what time it is God don't ever let them forget that I thank you God that you chose them you sent them here you have plans for them that greatness rise up in them an excitement and celebration and Jesus name I thank you for blessing them when they lie down tonight get in sweet dreams show them dreams of their destiny catch them up to heaven let them have encounters father you're no respecter of persons I thank you that you love all of us very dearly so let your presence remain with them forever I thank you Father amen praise

win this is a part of time appointed by me from heaven earth this night i light a flame on the top of this mountain it will never be put off for you have stood to adversity through the lies to the accusations through the control the demands of man you have worshipped me you have not forgotten my son you have not forgotten what he's done you will be blessed and you will never stop being blessed for i am the god of everybody and the god of everything i'm about to shake this earth great exposure of the darkness matter what people or the fake news or the lying liberals have said about me or this time they don't know anything [Music] if they do not stop they will lose everything their words will become dust and blown away like they were never there for i say this is a time of greatness of acceleration you've never known are the manifested sons and daughters to come forth to demonstrate to manifest my power my love my plans the devil has plans he will fail and he will lose again and again and again and again and again and again [Music] for i have already said i will be in the white house for 24 years there is no one on this earth in this earth under this earth that can stop it from happening for i will have these days on the earth the great days the great days of knowing there is a god that he speaks that he sears sees and hears if my prophets do not prophesy what i say they will not have a voice until that season is over for these are not the days of doom and gloom these are not the days of the rapture the perilous times the tribulation they're times of greatness of the fire and the glory sweeping over this earth touching everyone crushing the darkness and pushing it back for i am cleaning the stage wiping it clean are the enemies camp are the enemy's people are the enemies dust [Music] for i will have my way my son made a way i will not ignore what he has done and i will not have a weak pathetic testimony of his sacrifice no one says when he is coming back but me and i am not ready for i will set you on fire and you will demonstrate like no one has before in all of history the powerful things of god to speak to the land the sea in the air and it will move do not tolerate evil and do not participate with it you choose life or death because they're apparently out there right now always choose life for when you side with those who want death of the unburned you will never win you will never succeed or complete your destiny you will repent because i bring life and life abundantly but you must choose it and if you choose it you must live it get out of the gray area stop riding on the fence for i hear those who've humbled themselves whose heart cries out for more but this time you get to bring them more i said it would be my sons and daughters who did it there is no age for them whether it's three or 153 you choose for if you sit on the side and do nothing that's what you will have a boring life an unfruitful life be bold and step out let people know what you believe and who you believe they'll come beating your door down to find out about your god not the false gods who have no life not the lies of the enemy he thinks he can take my country for it is mine i created it i called it into being i had people fight for it and die for it in the seasons past you've died to live for me but it now you will live and not die if you choose was it what is it to you if i keep you until my son returns be strong be excited and celebrate the victory even before it happens [Music] do not listen to the doom and gloom that does not come from me but fearful hearts that don't know what time it is they don't know what my plans are and they want to escape run your race but run it with me for i'll be right beside you and i will open the eyes of many and they will see me and they will know their god those who have stood and been faithful even under attack even though things were taken from you do you not think i can give you a hundred times more than what you had it is my desire to bless you it is my desire to be with you for there are times there are only in the power of my hand and these are some of those times listen to what is true where there is no confusion and nothing hidden don't believe the lies of those who live in sin and say they live and speak for me some have removed from the earth [Music] i won't allow their testimony of who i am to be here many who are lying cheating and stealing and even killing will lose not just their state but their life this is a holy time but it is a time to celebrate heaven celebrates with this time live on earth like they live in heaven but you have to be willing and obedient the host will not listen to those to be commanded by those who do not speak the words of my son nor have him in their heart not just as their savior but as their king many kings will come forth in this time for my son is the king of spiritual kings and the lord of spiritual lords and the spirit there is no difference between male nor female both can rise to that position of authority and dominion but you have to pursue it [Music] and if you want my thoughts you better walk in my ways and you better say his will his way not his will man's way i'm about to consume this country and people will come here to find me not just the american dream some regions the light and the glory will be so great in people will drive their dead relatives in there they'll come to life neither sin nor crime nor sickness will be able to abide in those regions [Music] you are forerunners it is an honor and a privilege to be chosen if you're alive and you're breathing and you've given yourself to my son you are chosen know this night that your god has visited you and spoken his words to you if they don't light up with others then do not receive those words for i stand on my work and beside my son on my throne these are days we have talked about before you were ever born before the earth was made we spoke of these days why would i give them up if you buy a bible and it says it's my word and it's left parts out don't read it if it makes it easy to live to freely sin there's other gods beside me that can bring you to my home those are lies from hell for my word and my truth will make you free says your god a man [Music] [Music] oh can you hear me now [Music] i know there are people who will tell you that you cannot see the faces of god and live but even the one who spoke those words and they were written in the word saw the face of god john himself in the book of john said you cannot see the face of god and live but in the book of revelation in chapter 4 he was caught up he was in the spirit that's a place you walk in he's in a place on that day where he could hear no word of man on the isle of patmos at least that day unless he decided to walk off of it i chose to let him see things are different because he was in that place i could catch him up and stand before my throne with the living rainbow moving in and out of me with life moving in and out of me and he saw my face and never again after that did he say you cannot see the face of god and live for i have caught many up and showed many my face my plans but this one standing before you she is my revelator i will never stop taking her to heaven what business is it to you if i want to i held the air you breathe if i choose somebody who's been willing and obedient and laid down their life every time i asked why would i not trust her yes she's a woman and she's a king in the spirit she's not just my servant she is my daughter and it is my great pleasure to reveal her as my treasure to operate without measuring these days [Music] if you're willing to pay the price you think it's so easy to have to live a halfway normal life on this earth when you're so connected to me in heaven she does not see things like you see them but she will reveal everything i show her and will not be afraid of the face of man even hell trembles when she speaks [Applause] everyone should be dangerous against hell [Music] it is evil and wickedness that tries to consume your country but i will not tolerate it for my people have humbled themselves they have repented of their wicked ways and i will heal their land [Music] for i hear everyone and i see everyone nothing is hidden from me when i look at the earth i rejoice i remember when my son and i made it we made it to kerry the glory the power the wonder a stopover station before you come home i know your trials i know your test if you fall down get up [Applause] tell the enemy you will no longer tolerate him in your life that means you will not tolerate his images his words his frequencies his songs you create a habitation for heaven in your home and it will come you will see angels coming and going for you are in a new season the season of the high call of god of your god why did you not expect for things to be exposed before every great thing was done hell always acted up but this time the exposure is for your benefit these are not new things they've always been here you just never knew it i'm pulling away every closed door basement building things hidden in the wilderness things hidden in the forest even things hidden underground i will expose it all [Applause] the lives of those those who want to stand and run your country but hate me hate life even hate the people they want to govern it will not happen [Applause] for i will shake them and nothing will be hidden but openly shown and dealt with even those have already been in power and think they've gotten away with it they will not trump may not be perfect but he gives me permission to be in this country from the highest office in the land he has welcomed me and prayed to me and made friends with my pastors my prophets my teachers my evangelist his closest friends are my sons and daughters but the world would reject them and hate them there are many people in this world praying for your president even they love him even they recognize the good in him the authority in him he will help to shift many leaders of many governments so i can shape that nation and he will sweep his platform clean one day to make room for pence i have heard words spoken against my vice president and i am not happy he is a godly man who is not afraid of anything he is a strong tower to temper your president he will win two terms also [Applause] for i have written that in my book and what my book says it will happen not maybe happen [Applause] whoever he picks to be his vice president will then be president for eight years after him by that time there'll be no opposition that will even have a voice to speak [Music] [Applause] america will be a great light to this world it is my gift to this world who allows my son my greatest gift to operate in this world get ready because the show is beginning [Applause] [Music] there's coming a day when people will step into a store thinking they're going to buy something and they will step into my glory and begin to cry out to know me [Music] satan knows about these days but he was hoping he could stop them this is a place of freedom liberty and justice for all it is also a place for righteousness and holiness that your amazing forefathers heard my voice and made plans for it the enemy has always been afraid of america don't be afraid even if you come home you'll be with me there is no fear not even in death you just step from life to life [Applause] if your family live here they're the most blessed people in existence make plans to be great because it is time for i will pour out my spirit on all flesh children will begin to pastor at age five [Applause] children are the easiest to reach because they don't question and they don't reason and they don't let their mind get involved that's why i said you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom you have not because you asked not but those who've asked already will surely get what they have asked for it is a new time on the earth a miracle will be an example but many countries will run to the light and to my son for there is a habitation coming that will not end until i say it will [Applause] end rejoice that i have shown these things and spoken to you of these things for those are my plans the more you believe it is real the more real it will become there's coming a day very soon that when you come here the glory will be waiting portals are being opened everywhere for heaven to pour in but also for blessings to pour in those who say i cannot speak through the voice of a man or mankind don't know me make sure you laugh laughter is the language of heaven but profanity is the language of hell don't let those words be in your mouth in your home allowed to enter into your home guard your soul and the souls of your children by not letting anything pass through any form of media it will be a trap of the enemy and what you've given permission to come will come if you say good morning to me every morning you'll be saying it before my throne you command the day by what you choose when you first wake up choose life and love my power my presence extreme discernment and get understanding these days will come quickly and your life will change day by day so all who hear this message if you are my son or my daughter if you have received my son and repented of your sins these words are for you do not walk around with your head held down but lift it up where your help comes from even if people laugh they will not be laughing for long term pray for those who have chosen the darkness and are expecting it to win some will take their life when they lose because their souls have been compromised by the lies they've been listening to guard well the layers of your soul what you put there and always choose life i love you says your god amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] oh it is hard to stand i won't fall i'm sure my angels are behind me i don't want a stool what is that no no but we could just lay hands on everybody and end it [Music] it's pretty pretty hard to top god and for those of you who don't think this is real may he come to you [Music] when i walked in the angel of the lord who looks just like jesus came in behind me to make sure i wouldn't fall down before i got up here and god's been speaking to me like the last several hours before i got here and some people think why is she late why is she late well are you going to turn around and say no to god i was right on time god was very wise calling me a revelator instead of a prophet because he knew all the bashers wouldn't know what a false revelator was [Music] [Applause] he was very detailed with me before i started traveling and speaking and he'd already warned me about a lot of stuff that would happen or would be said which i understand people don't understand what they don't know or they have not experienced their self it is hard for them to receive it seeing is not believing receiving is believing god has given me many titles i didn't ask for any of them and many people say i want to be you i go no you don't you don't really and i've heard people say he chose seven men before he chose you no he didn't he did choose me he knew me when i was in him he knew every one of you already knew what you would become and on your soul that he created he wrote if he would be male or female no matter how man says how that happens and your soul will be conflicted if you're told you're something else because your soul already knew what it was supposed to be but if the ones who wanted to take over have their way they would let anybody choose whatever they want to but god has a plan you were with him before you came to this earth before this world was made before he stretched out the universe the physical realm over the spiritual realm that's why when it says in revelations he will roll it up he knows where the ends are he had to put something out there that he could put physical things on because all he had the original realm is the spiritual realm the unseen realm unless he lets you see it from the time i was little i was a seer i saw the good guys and the bad guys i saw activities at the spirit realm you hear people talk about angels and demons there's much more than that all around you there's buildings built that both sides use depending on what is going around in that area there's platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places how do they get in high places they earn it by hunting for souls for the enemy these are wicked spiritual beings however when you learn to command an army that was created to pull down every stronghold of satan they're the ones who war against hell no matter what level of wickedness they operate in they can shred those platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places and they go through light buzz saws and they can't stop it from happening because we who have the flesh you're the ones who have authority in the earth every spirit would be coming from hell trying to take over they use people like they apparently are right now but they cannot do it they can't the earth is made for men and those who receive jesus christ you're called to rule in the spirit realm when you take authority and dominion in the spirit realm it then in packs and packs this physical realm and because we haven't known how to do it to his fullness satan has just taken all he wants to done what he wanted to kill who he wants to put fear in who he wants to we're not tolerating it anymore jesus clearly said the things i did you will do and greater things you will do than i did so you should be trying to stop the storms we can help you do that you can either email or call our office and ask for weather warrior information that's god's name that he gave for this group who's willing to step out and just do what his son did i didn't pick that name we are to take authority over any form of destructive weather and whether you know it or not in the word of god when he made the ocean and he made the land he told the ocean i set a boundary right here at the land and you will not pass over that's god's word that's his decree we are his sons and daughters it is our job to uphold that and tell those storms you will not cross over on the land or do destruction he created the weather to nourish the earth not to damage it so we sit down here and say god come and rescue us come and stop this and he's looking down saying i gave you authority you have authority you rule because the enemy knows he can get in and twist any of those weather system and use them the best he can because he comes to what kill steal destroy and one of the ways he does that is with the weather so our volcanoes are not supposed to be erupting tsunamis are not supposed to be destroying none of that stuff that's going on but there's been no voice or agreement in the body that they would no longer tolerate that he taught the disciples how to multiply food how to travel in the spirit realm how to take authority and dominion over all the power of the darkness cast out any and all demons to pray for the sick to be healed why are we tolerating the virus because i'm not it has no right here the body needs to wake up stand up and step out you can wake up all you want to he wants you to do all of those things and i can tell you right now the meteorologists don't know what's happening they're going wild we even have some of their briefings where they talked about what is wrong with this weather they're almost afraid to give a forecast of anything because it never happens and then they faked it they faked it to prove these things were happening those weren't even the storm that was going on those in the area that the storms are headed to have the greatest authority if you're a believer so those on the east coast we have melt we have built a wall and if you go back and look at every storm that's come after dorian when we told it we all started saying you will not and cannot cross over the boundaries god set for you and all the way down not just in florida where we started it all the way up the east coast believers were standing there saying you will not cross over and do destruction and every time a storm comes you can go look at it it comes a certain way then it hits the wall and goes back out and they don't understand it's simply the body of christ taking authority so when we learn oh hawaii has got it down we have a lot of friends there's a lot of weather warriors that live in hawaii it doesn't even get started before they get out there and they start i'll never forget the time that this massive like i think was category five was coming and i had been teaching and talking to him about taking authority and we all declared that this storm will not be allowed to come ashore and the head of it would be taken off and when everyone went to bed except me because i don't sleep at night when they all went to bed when they woke up there was nothing but shreds left and they couldn't understand or get it they knew for sure that the the island would be consumed and those people those weatherboards in hawaii would not let up that prayer of agreement we had they said we don't know how it happened but it looks like the head was taken these are the meteorologists saying this the head was taken right off [Music] it was a nothing and one reporter said never in 25 years of being a meteorologist i ever see i never saw that happen i'm still trying to go back over all the tapes all the information that we've accumulated to know exactly what should have happened and it didn't happen why because they're not tolerating it so whoever lives in the gulf better start stepping up is not coming to florida i live there and i'm not putting up with it anymore [Applause] you need to just get fed up what yes whoever has the fires in your state you better start saying you're not tolerating it anymore you come into low pressure system to form and come in and put the fires out [Applause] that is not something new in the bible they called forth rain to come and they begin to see the clouds form did it come and did it rain why are we any different than them it's called believing your faith and guess what in heaven you'll need your faith not to pay your rent not to be healed not for any of those things but to begin to create who is our father do you know in the bible when it says let us make men in our image that's what they look like like with the glory on them the light of god on them but after our likeness is how they operate we're supposed to operate like them we are not god you don't want to be god i don't want to be god i've seen a lot but i still don't want to be god no one's that many kids the devil actually isn't god's problem it's how we all pray and stand against them he should be running does it say he will run from us do you remember that scripture you submit yourself under the hand of god and resist the enemy what will he do he will flee from you he's talking to you you do you know the word resist doesn't go oh no no i don't know what there's something i will not tolerate you you're a liar and a friar and i serve the most high god only him and he'll run there are people the demons beg not to be assigned to because when they come back and they're not successful with their assignment they get punished the devil doesn't give anybody rewards not even his own he just punishes them when they don't listen so they don't want to they'll lie they'll do anything they can they don't want to and by the way when you learn to release the anointing they burn on and it hurts they'll burn if they get near the fire of god it will burn them like it's going to melt them they may live in hell's fire they don't want god's fire that's why baptism in fire is coming [Applause] see i was raised on the word of god god chose when my birth would happen on this earth he chose my fathers my mothers by the way my mother is here tonight she'll be 90 next april she had 15 children i am number three and my sister's number 15 right there and any of them could testify to anything i am saying i never was normal i didn't want to speak to people even though i was i didn't want to speak to people i didn't want to hug them i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you know my little nice apartment somewhere and do big business he took me out of my world of business yeah it's like he didn't know he needed paychecks seriously he did this he always told me before he would do something with me my grandmother was my dad's mother was a powerful woman of god she was in the jungles of panama and was afraid of nothing ever she'd come to our home on sabbatical i mean we had more kids than anybody she could have come any anywhere i don't remember she had eight or nine of her own our aunts and uncles so she had a lot of children but she always came to our house because god was there we knew she could see through the walls we knew she could see right inside of us and every time she came she'd lay her hand on her head you will serve and know the most high god and my brother would run and hide i'm not going to be a missionary and be eaten by the alligators or crocodiles no right now they lock them on death row to minister to death apprentice prisoners he's invited by hell's angels to come and do funerals i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles anymore my mom would tell me every day you are so strange i don't know what god's going to do with you i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day my whole life i would know things my siblings didn't care too much for that my dad was a great mentor but his own mother in the jungles of panama on her own they had a murderer loose in the village i know some of you heard the story before but it just shows you who she was she was on the mission field in the little hut somewhere where she was ministering and she i think she lived there for i forgot how many years many years and everybody was boarding up their windows to keep this murder from out she left her window open and she went to sleep right in front of the window because guess what she knew god sure enough late at night here comes a foot in the window and this huge machete coming with him and she turn around look at him and she goes freeze in jesus name and rolled over and went back to sleep and three hours later when the police arrived he was still frozen [Applause] that was my grandmother i was taught to never be afraid i knew there was a god i knew there was his son i knew there was holy spirit who is my best friend that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a day that's what that means let me speak to you 24 hours a day but lots of times he's tweaking you he wouldn't warn me something's going to happen i don't think i'd do that that's what he says to me i don't think i'd go there so i'm not going to go there okay i don't ask him why but you have to have your ears open to listen and it's really good idea if you say i choose holy spirit to give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention it is one of the most powerful things you can say anybody here let's just say it together holy spirit from this moment on i give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention so be it there you did it i did that when i was really young it saved me a lot let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen she'd come up here now she would preach all the time she knows that's true because he does the same thing with her every morning it's called living a new life heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a lifestyle so if you want to live on earth as they live in heaven you need to learn to live heaven culture what is that how they live in heaven and living the same way on the earth they're free of fear free of lack free of grief free of anything of the enemy never sick they go well they're in heaven yes they are but our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come by the way that is heaven your kingdom is heaven you're speaking to the father right your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven that is heaven culture you are literally praying a prayer that asks for heaven culture and he's released it on the earth you choose it you lose everything under your soul that's not him every trauma from the past every wicked evil disgusting vile movie you've ever watched with your eyes it's in your soul that's why he says to guard it for out of it will flow the way you live your life as a man think it's in his heart which is your soul not talking about your human beating heart the heart also means the core or the center of something that's your soul that's what you are you are a living soul and what you fill it with is what you will become that's why people you've known all your life kind nice people i know some of them who now hate with a hate i've never seen before in people they hate and despise don't even know why why they listen to the fake news and for years they have filled their layers you have layers whatever you feel the most of is what you're going to begin to act like so if you don't like you change what you're watching even what you say goes in your own soul so if you don't like you you've been telling yourself that for years and you put another layer of it in you and what's in there is what you will think about and if you think about it you're going to choose it if you choose it you're going to do it again that's called what criminals do this is true that's why a criminal will get out of prison go commit a crime and go back right back to prison if they've been there 20 years it'll you know why it's in their soul and i've been to prison to talk it's good to hear that and i had 80 prisoners and they had somebody guards trying to watch they never watched they listened to protect me my husband was with me sitting up here staring at every one of them but then even he was crying and i told them how they were sought out by the enemy even as a little child they had a great call on their life so he didn't want them to be loosed on the earth they might find out who they are and do destruction to his plans so he gets them into crime this is truth he gets them into crime when you do it it was in your soul then he makes sure they get caught and then they get put in prison where they can't be a threat to him so every time they get up because it's in them guess what they do it doesn't matter how much therapy they give them how many classes they take them to if they can't get it out of them they'll think about it they'll do it and then they're back in the same place so i told them the story of their life this is what you're doing this is why you're doing it this is what god had for you this is what satan is doing to you and will proceed to do it to every member of your family if you can then they begin to cry then they get furious you get mad at the devil then they get born again filled with the holy spirit then it teaches them how to war i teach them how to send heaven's army so now insider prisons are very dangerous people who are dangerous against hell i mean anybody could go to prison right but why are these people in rhythm they are dangerous because of their destiny and satan doesn't want them loose your soul is very important to you don't ever forget that you choose with your soul all day long you choose christ right after that you should choose what he chooses all day long you should guide what you choose what you watch what you say i love that little saying these half years what would jesus do what would he say what would he choose it's actually a very free life to not sin people get shocked when they say i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's not you choose not to you just say no say no to who was ever asking you sorry my soul is too important i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really think you were weird who cares because when they start to die they'll call you to pray for them they'll look for you if it's on their deathbed hey you know about heaven i need to go there don't forget they made fun of you that's why it's important that you not suffer trauma for 30 years after it happened you know who's doing that the devil because you saw it or experienced it and he will replay it and replay it stop the video stop it stop it stop it and lose it from your soul jesus and after your will because of jesus to lose it from your soul he'll come down and pull it out and it will literally be like it never happened to you i've seen too many people set free and they went from being you know in the drudges of despair suicidal they'd have these dreams every night about the torment or whatever it was the trauma they went through and three minutes with me and the revelation god gave me while their husband their pastor went in the store to get me some things to eat i was invited to speak his wife was set free she was a different person when he came out and then she brought her 17 year old and her 11 eleven-year-old sons to me because they were present when she was abused so much they lose out all their soul and they haven't never six years later have never had another nightmare or torment you can be free the truth makes you free and the truth is you can be free even from heroin from witchcraft homosexuality it doesn't matter what it is from the enemy you choose with your will to be free and yes we pray for people to be free from homosexuality which is a spirit and guess what they have powerful destinies every one of them the devil targets the ones who have the greatest destinies to bring freedom or liberty to people and he wants to keep them from doing that so he gets them distracted sidetracked on the wrong path filled with lies believing that's how god made them but remember when he made them he wrote on their soul this is who you are this is what you will be and he had plans for them from that moment i will tell you this there is a move coming to them and millions of them will get born again [Applause] [Music] not not not just a few millions he'll move on them they'll know who they will they'll know the entire time it was a lie and they will repent from it reject it completely and run into god's kingdom and they'll be great witnesses i will also tell you this millions of muslims are about to expect they will experience salvation god is still into saving people number one thing make sure you belong to him if you get saved at least you're going to have it a lot of people have it happen on their deathbed and the family member said i never saw it happen so you think it didn't happen did you believe they would be because the number one thing besides getting jesus you better believing that your family members will know jesus christ give their life to him and be with you in heaven there's a reason why you should do that you have the greatest influence in the spirit realm over their life as family members and jesus the first time he took me to heaven said there'd be so many in the earth to be shocked when they get there to see who's up there and yet they were the very one who prayed and believed for their salvation we have so many promises as a believer we as the body of will see an example a living walking breathing taking authority dominion releasing life to people and let them see you happy and joyful while you're doing it maybe they might want jesus one of the biggest things i know it will happen eventually the world will know us the body of christ by our what our love for each other stop fighting the plan of the enemy divide and conquer is his plan and in this whole last year several years before the virus it's not a plague and it is not a disease even in the natural viruses come and they go but people act like they are i'm not saying you can't protect yourself if you want to i'm not tolerating sickness or disease i'm not tolerating it every time you bless your food i hope you're blessing your food i won't ask for a show of hands my daddy let us eat after we blessed our food and then he added things the prayer went on forever i know where he got it from because when his mom came off the mission field she would have a 40-minute prayer at the dinner and she knew that open her eyes if you're going to leave the table and then she'd pray for you blessing your food is a very powerful thing because it says when you do that and you ask he will take sickness far from you [Music] so if you haven't been doing it do it that means he won't allow it to come to you or your home that's what you've got an interpretation he won't allow it to come to you or your home if you were declaring that when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes long but you know i added a few things i will hold my plate up in the restaurant or anywhere else look at father doesn't this smell good i'm going to enjoy every bite of it so bless it to my body and may the isis have a never-ending crisis may hell have triple trouble in hell as long as i'm alive i thank you for blessing all those who serve you who know you who love you amen so if we go out together after i'm invited and that pastor says will you bless the food who's ever with me will go okay and what are they gonna do here i'm picking up my plate are they gonna sit there and just stare at theirs lift it up everybody [Applause] i'm training you to bless your food that you actually can have food and actually can eat the food amen many countries can't do that but we can remember that the next time somebody asks you to say blessing i challenge you to do it do you know why because it was a day when i was in my late teens and i was saying my wrote prayer father thank you for this blessing he's in my body and what's wrong with his name my person thank you amen did you even hear those words and i literally heard from heaven this is before he started taking me i heard like a rubber stamp wham 500 billion 260 million 810 0001 can you say something else that we might actually be excited to hear he really said that to me so from that day i have never blessed my food like that it's a habit that's not a blessing that's not a blessing it's a habit right you need to get god excited father i thank you for this amazing food it smells good looks good i can't wait to see what you're going to do with me next i am so ready who cares what people hear at least they'll know there's someone around that knows god my little sister gave her famous blessing i think she was four or five and we were all not one of our other sisters i have eight sisters and seven brothers in an alligator named charlie but he's in heaven he doesn't have to live in a bathtub up but i've seen him in heaven your pets i'll go to heaven be nice to them they'll remember you and they'll talk [Applause] [Music] and i already hear some people's heads it's too late to tell me that's not true you haven't been there because if you did you would know that why not did you know that many animals actually have a spirit and a soul go back to genesis and read when noah back in the day when my meetings would be six hours long i'd do three or four i was just like like this and i would call let's see i called them i have called noah moses and adam and then one time i called him noses because my head was so tired i couldn't remember and every time i did that everybody emailed me i don't think you know who actually put people on the ark and then we get phone calls and they go yeah she knows she blew what okay she knows this is moa and moses and noah because you know she couldn't really remember if you go back and read that you know what i'm telling this is what the father told me this is how he taught me like a little kid because when i go to heaven i'm like eight years old with pigtails and he actually talks to all of you like children man is the one who likes to expound and make things totally not even understandable or approachable but god doesn't talk to us like that so he talked me said i'm going to teach you something and why because i'd seen pets in heaven and i'm like wow there's every one of my pets they were in this long line and they were on my father's ranch in heaven and they started with sally the pig and i got i got corrected because i said there was pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the pig he was a family pet gave him to my father when he was tight for the ministry it was this big when it died it was 1100 pounds i saw her in heaven and her were two little mice that we had in new york city when you were allowed to have pets they lived in the wall they were residents so we just kept them i recognized my brother joey's duck name max that he had when he was nine charlie the alligator that i've always talked about we all had in florida we live in florida and he lived in our bathtub and we had to take it out and clean the tub and he'd wander around the bathroom every goat bird fish snake lots of them spiders and iguana named iggy i saw every single one of them in heaven every one of them a long line as long as you see following my dad walking around on my dad's ranch and the father took me to the store and he said i need to explain this to you because people will argue and they're not god so they think they know better than me but if you go read the scripture in genesis where i told noah to put the animals on the ark and then he took me further you know even closer further away at the beginning of time when he made adam and it talks about how you know god the father and jesus were both there by the way the father said adam jesus stepped out of him that's what the word always did he stepped out and made his body but there was no life in him until he did one thing the father leans over because the father carries life he leaned over and breathed adam's spirit of life that was his spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual body into his nostrils and he became a living soul and i went oh yeah i've always known that he said but you didn't never connect it to noah go back and read this scripture in genesis and i did and do you know what it says that god told noah to put every animal on the ark that had a spirit of life in it you don't have to believe me believe the word that meant those creatures had souls and a spirit body oh that's from god i can't take credit that's how revelation happens it changes the way you think so people will argue with you it's too late it's in the word so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul i think they just they go die and go to hell with the flies they came from hell they can't have a soul right but i did learn that all your pets go to heaven and then when one would die i'd actually see my angel take his spiritual body and take it to heaven your own guardian angel takes your pet's spiritual body and takes it to heaven and they live in your mansion they will be eating at the table when you get there they will not be eating off the floor anymore so people go it doesn't say the word animals are in heaven it says creatures preach the gospel to who what to what i preached the gospel to every pe i had i was gonna make sure they made it creatures remember around the throne the living they have bodies like animals but they're not they're highly intelligent have always been with god like melchizedek who had no father no mother no beginning or ends there was more than father son and holy spirit i always say father word and holy spirit and so melchizedek has always been with him he is father's personal high priest thank you not one of adam's sons he's not a human that died and went to heaven he's always been with him i've seen a syllabus this big that tells you about um what is it what is that one thing they talk about well number one they always talk about the stone god will give you when you get to heaven and you always see on the syllabus a river rock with some big long name because he will give you a nickname the only he and you know and that white rock is a white diamond is not a river rock the word rock in heaven means gemstone because he's not cheap or poor right when when you get married you give your the toes a ring with a diamond in it or some beautiful stone right he's old bran so get ready for your pets to be in heaven amen and they'll be with you for all eternity so i keep telling people be nice to them they'll thank you for how often you let them out or fed them the food under the table you weren't supposed to why do you think they tried to eat it off of the table later when you're not there you spoiled them so when he said heaven is beyond anything you ever thought or imagined it is unless i like the word unless it be revealed by his spirit so the spirit of god is the one who catches me up all the time without warning me i fall in the driveway i'll go to heaven i'm in the grocery store reaching for something he takes me to heaven my family know because they'll come in to talk to me and there's nothing in me this my spirit man's in heaven holy spirit climbs and keeps my body alive my husband is so used to it of 43 years he'll come in and say something to me i don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't look down and watch what people are doing are you kidding i'm listening to what god is showing me but my husband will say these words oh i'll come back later he is he is scottish he's not moved by anything even as his wife's body is sitting there not breathing he is not concerned see he picked the right person for me i remember the first day he saw an angel walking down our hallway and he freaked out although i've talked about them thousands of times he actually saw one he's like nothing would come out i said oh did you see the angel he never doubted he just never you don't sit there and cry because he doesn't get to go he's happy i go and he's happy i speak don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll get a joke and it will be a scottish silk that you'll never get the ending to you'll never get the punchline but if you ever want to fish and catch big fish that is a gift god gave him when he sent him from himself he made him a fisherman that's his passion that's his greatest thing besides me and jesus and guess what i hate i hate fish let willy be free i don't want him in my freezer in my home in a frying pan or on my table they're slimy they stink they smell and i don't like i don't like them so if i went fishing he'd have to take it off he'd still be here the jesus game and i'm not touching that fish and do you think god knew this of course he knew it of course he gave somebody somebody with five layers in their soul that's like a rock and you aren't ever changing that man i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can say loves jesus he hears very clearly gives me words from god all the time a little scratches of paper but doesn't talk about it so he gave me somebody who doesn't care about talking or want to talk thank god right because we'd be wearing each other out i pray for people spouses want to see they both minister and they're wanting the microphone [Applause] i have no competition yeah well my sister kind of makes up for her the baby who said she'd never talk to anybody but but taught 15. uh-huh how many kids you haven't used to class 16 two-year-olds for about 15 years now she's braver than me i don't want to do that i don't want to catch fish and i don't want that either but she's really good at so that's why she's writing all the children's books and they're amazing our artist is every time he gets time he works on it every child around the world will know there is a heaven there is a god and what life is like there and the last place i was taken that was new was called whimsical way it's up in the celestial realm the sky of heaven and any little child who wants to in heaven either climbs into a bubble gets on the bubble train and takes him up to this amazing place parents don't have to go and they have all these creatures little creatures that are their friends and one day we'll they'll be part of our amusement park we've made so heaven has got lots of plans for kids fun you're probably one of the first congregations i told this to it was amazing these little creatures had names they were wearing clothes they were friends to these other kids and they would all go up there whenever they want to and play and play and play and have fun create little things and then they come back down because you live with your parents or your grandparents or whoever is the closest in relation to you when you get to heaven no child is left alone we should celebrate who we are that is your destiny and the new earth i get a lot of flack from that get over it you're not god he's going to make a and say new say new means new he's already remodeled this one several times already he has yeah and when you get to heaven everybody gets to see when he made it you all learn how he made the earth the first time how it got messed up in verse two think about it verse one verse two how did that happen so quick in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that means it was done say don imperfect then wine number two is it a mess why is the water on the land and the sky why is it trapped underneath all that stuff why is the earth all split up why is it in darkness the first one he didn't need the sun or the moon yet he made him yet no he lit it with his glory we should study the book of jeremiah he turned the light out at one time satan was making the earth a wilderness rick not me knows but really when he made it the first time it was perfect and he lit it with his glory there was no evil on the earth at that time and then of course you all know satan lucifer was cast out of heaven down to the earth and he thought he was going to take over he's tried so many times i don't know why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs became evil because they got possessed and used and i know people talk about i don't know where they get these things from reptilian seed because god made the donors dinosaurs not satan oh you don't even want to know about the reptile you don't need to know about okay it doesn't have anything to do with us man comes up with their own head knowledge and understanding of something and there are no nephilim on the earth right now i assure you there aren't any so there's too much really to talk about all that you've already got what you really needed when the first 15-20 minutes you have revelation that a lot of people don't know what's going to happen you heard like uh i know 24-year plan but really actually heard about a 50-year plan i've been taking over 100 years into the future and the earth was still here and it was good it was really good each generation until god is ready to stop things it'll get stronger they will manifest more they'll be in charge more and children will probably be the first ones who command a mountain to jump into the sea and if they want to put it back they will because we go from where this is not glory to glory glory to glory glory to glory this is us now glory to the pit glory to the pit glory to depression glory to lack glory to lack that isn't the way it goes it goes from glory to glory to glory that is an upward motion in authority in dominion in joy and celebration and the earth being well a hundred years from now it will be like that so forget stop trying to make plans to escape i don't want to escape i want to be here i'll be here the whole time and the people well jesus comes tribulation comes it's all over no it's not you don't know the bible because jesus gets he will get his thousand-year reign and god's not keeping that from him why would he he's going to sit on that throne in jerusalem and be king of the world for a thousand years and it's still not over because satan will be in a big pit oh yeah there will be no weapons on the earth during that thousand years people will live to be seven and eight hundred years old because christ is sitting on the throne and there'll still be people who aren't saved so that means people will make it through the tribulation the whole earth will not be destroyed in the tribulation and everybody won't be killed off the earth as there'd be no natural people for jesus to rule over when he sits on that zone in jerusalem at the end of the tribulation right yeah who's he going to rule who's he going to be in charge of and there'll be kings and countries that don't want him there can you believe that they must have the let's be unintelligent i'll be polite it's not what my flesh wanted to say they will be as unintelligent as the devil they will not want him and they'll know he's the son of god i mean he just wiped up all the all the wicked evil armies right he won like trump won not that he's god but look at him he won and he thought this is going to be easy breezy and never has every devil around come after somebody so harshly they hate him because he stands for justice liberty and freedom but they really hated him when he became really dangerous and said i'm fighting god back in january that was it that was it the devil went crazy he's not going to stay in that seat i'll impeach him i declare i'm incompetent other people rise up all over you know what they want a civil war here for a long time they want all of us to run the streets and kill each other and i've told them i've talked to them sometimes do you not understand a true american they actually want life they want a future they have a family they don't want your garbage go to a third world country and live if you want socialism go where they have dominism we're not going to have it here why the people don't want it [Music] you don't want it and they'll make it sound like it's amazing make it sound like it's beautiful go to venezuela they're living in dumpsters if they can find one that's what happens i grew up because of my natural age i've been through many generations of time on the earth i remember the turmoil of the 60s when people wanted to have nothing but love and or war then they didn't want to go to war they didn't want to do nothing i remember that but i also remember doing we would do these what do you call them when you have to do little see my earth mine doesn't work so well not projects it's when you would hide under your desk in case the russians are coming to get you anybody here have to do that you were practicing if you were going to be bombed by the russians what's called the cold war it's pretty cold on that floor under my desk and when i was like eight nine ten they all did it they'd they'd stop and they would let the alarm go everybody would just buy habit oh drop what you're doing crawl under your desk and hide in case the bomb would hit we lived like that until it was ended okay so you don't want to live in russia i've been there the sadness is so horrific i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go unsure i could feel it and see it like black clouds of evil and that i could feel with the people with a great deep sadness and grief that they had no freedom because if they take your weapons the criminals aren't going to give up theirs you wonder where their heads are right and who in the world wants to do well i know this is political well you have to give it up because tomorrow that's what you're really going to get god is very politically minded he doesn't want that he only wants that who in the right mind shows you they probably don't have one anymore wants to defund the police i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in california or washington or oregon or new york chicago i could just go down this list who in their mind having had no freedom for five months would vote in that same governor or the senators or the people who didn't care if their places were being destroyed where does that come from i promise you i won't tell you some things the president's going to do as soon as he gets reelected he'll be tweaking some governors i'll just say that much and some mayors and getting laws changed [Music] because people even the ones who voted him and don't want them now because they who won't allow are having all the freedom they want to do what they want to and they're openly showing what's in their soul that's the point of all this god is exposing the souls of people and they can hide and smile behind their big office but when it comes push to shove what's in that soul is coming out and people couldn't believe it when it started happening what is wrong with those people are they insane because their people don't have liberty freedom and there is no justice there is no protection there's no food there's no jobs people's houses get broken into when they want to do you know how many people i want to tell you how many people have moved to florida we are being crushed with people every day because they were seeing us on the news having liberty freedom and justice enjoying our beaches we were as good as we could be to work along with the quarantine but we had fresh air everywhere we went you could open your door and have fresh air and people saw that and went i'm not staying here no more so they're moving out and that should obviously we think would show the head of that person who's in charge they don't like this they're leaving that means no votes now no one's going to want to vote them back in you want to go through that again and no tax money you're right no tax money to take care of anything it's a mess it's all free if they say give it up give it all there give it all to us we'll just take care of you don't even think that's what's going to happen you gave away your destiny your future your home your rights your rights your rights your rights ask what satan wants but he's not going to get away with it here say where to go so people have a lot of questions they'd like to ask me and we'd be here for 10 more hours and i wouldn't be sleeping people always invite me then if they ever ask me to visit their home they try so hard to stay up while i'm up and they're like falling asleep sitting next to me wanting to ask i don't do that anymore by the way i've actually spoken in i'm trying to remember the name of that great black university it's either maryland or washington dc i actually got to go speak there oh yeah george washington university yeah i did i was invited and they couldn't squeeze the people they couldn't get them they gave us a small room then bigger room a bigger room because the students asked for it and they have to say yes and they had so many crammed in there you couldn't hardly breathe and the next night there was even more and i was staying in the home of this family nobody could stay up they're like i gotta go to sleep and i'm still sitting here you know in heaven you don't have to sleep people go i always wanted a bedroom done a certain way well you'll get it he'll make it for you to make you happy it'll be your lounge room your meditation room you don't need to meditate when you're living with the one that you meditate about your mansions are amazing some are under the crystal sea somewhere up in the skies of heaven they have a rain forest in heaven these 12 massive trees that could hold some i've seen mansions the size of new york city one one mansion probably belonged to an intercessor seriously somebody you never knew or heard of you know they prayed in every move of god until they were going on they're probably still praying when they were leaving and i like to tell these young people you may be living your life you want to but if you have a grandma in heaven she's going to pray the fire of god down on you to send the angels of heaven to pursue you and talk to the holy spirit non-stop you may as well get up here roll over and lay down and give up right now because they're going to get you you'll listen to the prayers of your grandma i was in a where it was a fireman's sub i'll talk anywhere and somebody made a comment about my hair which god picked not me i did not pick this thing here i was not a pink hair person oh no remember i was the one that wanted to just hide i want to be invisible i was okay with being invisible he said you're not going to be invisible you're not going to be hiding anymore that's what he said to me we need you to have pink highlights in your hair now i had probably about 40 pastor friends in my city and then they thought that was it i went over the edge knowing me not changed but my pink hair made it impossible to to be friends with what is wrong with these people oh they have no clue they're they're in the flesh not the spirit this is a spirit test if you don't like it you're in the flesh you like it you're walking in the spirit so i don't ask for it but you can't hide so everywhere i go and pastors go i can't invite you my congregation would freak out if they saw your pink hair i said you just didn't know how many hours they watched of me on youtube and guess what they come to my meetings at the church next door to you i don't think they're not the ones who aren't ready i think it's you so because of this pink hair it opens up me to speak about heaven everywhere everywhere everywhere all day all day no matter where it is it's even happened here already it doesn't matter people are attracted to it while your hair is amazing yeah the pastor should hear that right get your evangelistic team to get color-colored highlights in their hair and send them out into the streets and see how many people they can draw it's great marketing and so they will say hey your hair is cool yeah this is heaven culture what does that mean that means i know god he asked me to have pink hands in his hair i've been to heaven they all have highlights what and they never say this you're lying this is what a non-believer no matter how on drugs whatever it is they'll go what did it look like you know their souls kind of loosened up because they've been taking something and what's in there will come out what did it look like i've had meetings at the cashier where the lines backing up then they're listening the bad boys are listening the bad boys at the next one cashier comes over so they can hear well i'm saying it's because of this thing here so i understand jesus when he said we need you to have pink highlights in your hair and he can read my thoughts and i'm thinking in my head why and he looked at me and says it's if the lord of glory ever says to you with all the love he has his heart it's necessary i don't care what he wants then he just keeps he keeps going we don't want you to be hidden you can't hide anymore we're going to market heaven with that pink hair we want people to know the truth we want to know it's not boring it's exciting it's powerful it's amazing i want you to know as a believer the authority and dominion that you have in this earth and it's okay if you color highlights in your hair you look like heaven angels are different colors they're not just all pasty white glowing with white wings in a white gown some would probably make you crawl under your seat they have a band around their head with eyes and that whole band they have they have this this whatever thing they call this thing a breastplate thank you yes they have eyes all through them in the front and the back their wings are made out of electricity or lightning their faces are angular their eyes are diamond shaped if one comes in your room it's not from hell and some of them can look really fierce really fears like i have two heads one facing this way one facing that way they both look front and back no matter where they're turning they can see some are weapons they don't need to carry weapons i'm more acquainted with the army of heaven than gabriel's group i've seen gabriel's group i know my guardian angel i've known him since i was little he's 40 feet high i won't tell you his name ask god would you tell me what my angel's name is so i could say thank you you're not worshiping him and they won't let you worship them and an army doesn't get worshipped they want commands they need orders like this army they have generals they have privates they have commanders all kind of levels in the army itself but we get to command because jesus christ did they were made for us to command they don't protect heaven not one angel there's not one angel building is not one was designed to protect heaven from who from who the army didn't even get to throw them all out michael held him while god zapped him with a lightning bolt from himself it says i saw a satan fall as lightning well one third of the angels went right behind him he kicked them all out that was his um intolerance no tolerance for evil or wickedness he doesn't want us to tolerate it either your words your deeds what you choose what you say especially declare yourself into the spirit realm how you go get a staff it helps well i declare the state will not have my neighborhood i come in the host of heaven to get into every single home leave the life of god in there speak to every person while they're sleeping drive out every demon from this place because i'm not living near them and i will not tolerate them and i won't then i went from that to my city then i went to that to my state driving all the witches out please don't dress like a witch on october 31st you're inviting them harvest festival one thing don't participate with satan's holiday my daddy always told me it was wrong i said to my grandmother and one day we realize it is wrong why would he have a holiday he deserves nothing remember that when you get invited to something one day we in one quest will have the biggest festivals of light all over the world on october 31st we will celebrate life the life of god his plans and we'll throw a party everywhere we go and tell people what hell is really like and so is halloween you don't want it you're participating don't look at me weird i've been to hell you don't want to participate it's all real his plans his revelation his son holy spirit christ wiping up hell on the third day they were screaming and running he was melting the faces of the hierarchy of hell enjoying it why did it say he made a show of it he was putting on a show in hell god put a show on in heaven right when he kicked him out christ put a show on in helm when he wiped him all out guess who gets to put the show on on the earth we do we do because of jesus for jesus and with jesus we will put the biggest show on ever that is why he calls us his sons and daughters that's why he says we will manifest his absolute power and authority in the earth it is our right as a born-again believer having invited jesus into our lives when i was four and i asked him in i saw him step in me i was four years old don't discount your little kids i liked it so much when i was five i did it again so i'm book one i said i got born again at four on book five book two hey don't tell me there's five and book two i said i got saved to five and this woman who loved everything i had been saying and receiving it when she found out she said you lied this is a legal minded person you lied you said you were born again at four and you said five you didn't even remember i said excuse me i did it twice maybe you should maybe you should do it again in the assemblies of god we got saved every week we did whether we needed to or not we still got saved oh the baptist did it all the time they're doing everybody's neighborhood in their yard it doesn't matter the baptists are great soul winners y'all they really are they're very bold but don't let the watchtower people come in your home don't want to give you their watchtower magazine burn it or shred it it's false religion all false religions are run by one person that satan is called an antichrist spirit remember jesus talked about it that means anything is against christ's sovereignty and his his holiness of who he is his his anything who's against that that speaks against that isn't antichrist spirit let's all stand up for a

do you believe [Music] [Music] superhero [Music] and he will win [Applause] this is a part of time appointed by me from heaven this night i light a flame on the top of this mountain it will never be put out for you have stood through adversity through the lies to the accusations through the control the demands of man you have worshipped me you have not forgotten my son you have not forgotten what he's done you will be blessed and you will never stop being blessed for i am the god of everybody and the god of everything i'm about to shake this earth great exposure of the darkness [Music] [Applause] no matter what people or the fake news or the lying liberals have said about me or this time they don't know anything [Music] if they do not stop they will lose everything their words will become dust and blown away like they were never there for i say this is a time of greatness of acceleration you've never known and the manifested sons and daughters to come forth to demonstrate to manifest my power my love my plans [Music] the devil has plans he will fail and he will lose again and again and again and again and again and again [Music] for i have already said i will be in the white house for 24 years [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is no one on this earth in this earth under this earth that can stop it from happening for i will have these days on the earth the great days the great days of knowing there is a god that he speaks that he sears sees and hears if my prophets do not prophesy what i say they will not have a voice until that season is over for these are not the days of doom and gloom these are not the days of the rapture the perilous times the tribulation they're times of greatness of the fire and the glory sweeping over this earth touching everyone crushing the darkness and pushing it back for i am cleaning the stage wiping it clean are the enemies camp are the enemies people are the enemies dust [Music] for i will have my way my son made a way i will not ignore what he has done and i will not have a weak pathetic testimony of his sacrifice no one says when he is coming back but me and i am not ready for i will set you on fire and you will demonstrate like no one has before in all of history the powerful things of god to speak to the land the sea in the air and it will move do not tolerate evil and do not participate with it you choose life or death because they are apparently out there right now always choose life for when you side with those who want death of the unburn you will never win you will never succeed or complete your destiny you will repent because i bring life and life abundantly but you must choose it and if you choose it you must live it get out of the gray area stop riding on the fence for i hear those who've humbled themselves whose heart cries out for more but this time you get to bring them more [Music] i said it would be my sons and daughters who did it there is no age for them whether it's three or 153 you choose for if you sit on the side and do nothing that's what you will have a boring life an unfruitful life be bold and step out let people know what you believe and who you believe they'll come beating your door down to find out about your god not the false gods who have no life not the lies of the enemy he thinks he can take my country for it is mine i created it i called it into being i had people fight for it and die for it in the seasons past you've died to live for me but it now you will live and not die if you choose was it what is it to you if i keep you until my son returns be strong be excited and celebrate the victory even before it happens do not listen to the doom and gloom that does not come from me but fearful hearts that don't know what time it is they don't know what my plans are and they want to escape run your race but run it with me for i'll be right beside you and i will open the eyes of many and they will see me and they will know their god those who have stood and been faithful even under attack even though things were taken from you do you not think i can give you a hundred times more than what you had it is my desire to bless you it is my desire to be with you for there are times there are only in the power of my hand and these are some of those times listen to what is true where there is no confusion and nothing hidden don't believe the lies of those who live in sin and say they live and speak for me someone will remove from the earth [Music] i won't allow their testimony of who i am to be here many who are lying cheating and stealing and even killing will lose not just their seat but their life this is a holy time but it is a time to celebrate heaven celebrates with this time live on earth like they live in heaven but you have to be willing and obedient the host will not listen to those to be commanded by those who do not speak the words of my son nor have him in their heart not just as their savior but as their king many kings will come forth in this time for my son is the king of spiritual kings and the lord of spiritual lords in the spirit there is no difference between male nor female both can rise to that position of authority and dominion but you have to pursue it and if you want my thoughts you better walk in my ways and you better say his will his way not his will man's way i'm about to consume this country and people will come here to find me not just the american dream some regions the light and the glory will be so great in people will drive their dead relatives in there they'll come to life [Music] neither sin nor crime nor sickness will be able to abide in those regions you are forerunners it is an honor and a privilege to be chosen if you're alive and you're breathing and you've given yourself to my son you are chosen know this night that your god has visited you and spoken his words to you if they don't light up with others then do not receive those words for i stand on my word and beside my son on my throne these are days we have talked about before you were ever born before the earth was made we spoke of these days why would i give them up if you buy a bible and it says it's my word and it's left parts out don't read it if it makes it easy to live to freely sin there's the gods beside me that can bring you to my home those are lies from hell for my word and my truth will make you free says your god amen and amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] can you hear me now [Music] i know there are people who will tell you that you cannot see the faces of god and live but even the one who spoke those words and they were written in the word saw the face of god john himself in the book of john said you cannot see the face of god and live but in the book of revelation in chapter 4 he was caught up he was in the spirit that's a place you walk in he was in a place on that day where he could hear no word of man on the isle of patmos at least that day unless he decided to walk off of it i chose to let him see things are different because he was in that place i could catch him up and stand before my throne with the living rainbow moving in and out of me with life moving in and out of me and he saw my face and never again after that did he say you cannot see the face of god and live for i have caught many up and showed many my face my plans but this one's standing before you she is my revelator i will never stop taking her to heaven what business is it to you if i want to i hold the air you breathe if i choose somebody who's been willing and obedient and laid down in their life every time i asked why would i not trust her yes she's a woman and she's a king in the spirit [Applause] she's not just my servant she is my daughter and it is my great pleasure to reveal her as my treasure to operate without measure in these days [Music] if you're willing to pay the price you think it's so easy to have to live a halfway normal life on this earth when you're so connected to me in heaven she does not see things like you see them but she will reveal everything i show her and will not be afraid of the face of man even hell trembles when she speaks [Applause] everyone should be dangerous against hell it is evil and wickedness that tries to consume your country but i will not tolerate it for my people have humbled themselves they have repented of their wicked ways and i will heal their land [Music] for i hear everyone and i see everyone nothing is hidden from me when i look at the earth i rejoice i remember when my son and i made it we made it to kerry the glory the power the a wonder station before you come home i know your trials i know your test if you fall down get up [Applause] tell the enemy you will no longer tolerate him in your life that means you will not tolerate his images his words his frequencies his songs you create a habitation for heaven in your home and it will come you will see angels coming and going for you are in a new season the season of the high call of god of your god why did you not expect for things to be exposed before every great thing was done hell always acted up but this time the exposure is for your benefit these are not new things they've always been here you just never knew it i'm pulling away every closed door basement building things hidden in the wilderness things hidden in the forest even things hidden underground i will expose it all [Applause] the lives of those those who want to stand and run your country but hate me hate life even hate the people they want to govern it will not happen for i will shake them and nothing will be hidden but openly shown and dealt with even those have already been in power and think they've gotten away with it [Applause] [Music] they will not trump may not be perfect but he gives me permission to be in this country from the highest office in the land he has welcomed me and prayed to me and made friends with my pastors my prophets my teachers my evangelists his closest friends are my sons and daughters but the world would reject them and hate them there are many people in this world praying for your president even they love him even they recognize the good in him the authority in him he will help to shift many leaders of many governments so i can shape that nation and he will sweep his platform clean one day to make room for pence i have heard words spoken against my vice president and i am not happy he is a godly man who is not afraid of anything he is a strong tower to temper your president he will win two terms also [Music] [Applause] for i have written that in my book and what my book says it will happen not maybe happen [Music] [Applause] whoever he picks to be his vice president will then be president for eight years after him by that time there'll be no opposition that will even have a voice to speak [Music] [Applause] america will be a great light to this world it is my gift to this world who allows my son my greatest gift to operate in this world get ready because the show is beginning [Music] there's coming a day when people will step into a store thinking they're going to buy something and they will step into my glory and begin to cry out to know me satan knows about these days but he was hoping he could stop them this is a place of freedom liberty and justice for all it is also a place for righteousness and holiness that your amazing forefathers heard my voice and made plans for it the enemy has always been afraid of america don't be afraid even if you come home you'll be with me there is no fear not even in death you just step from life to life if your family live here they're the most blessed people in existence plans to be great because it is time for i will pour out my spirit on all flesh children will begin to pastor at age [Applause] five children are the easiest to reach because they don't question and they don't reason and they don't let their mind get involved that's why i said you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom you have not because you asked not but those who've asked already will surely get what they have asked for it is a new time on the earth a miracle will be an example but many countries will run to the light and to my son for there is a habitation coming that will not end until i say it will [Applause] end rejoice that i have shown these things and spoken to you of these things for those are my plans the more you believe it is real the more real it will become there's coming a day very soon that when you come here the glory will be waiting [Music] portals are being opened everywhere for heaven to pour in but also for blessings to pour in those who say i cannot speak through the voice of a man or mankind don't know me make sure you laugh laughter is the language of heaven but profanity is the language of hell don't let those words be in your mouth in your home allowed to enter into your home guard your soul and the souls of your children by not letting anything pass through any form of media it will be a trap of the enemy of what you've given permission to come will come if you say good morning to me every morning you'll be saying it before my throne you command the day by what you choose when you first wake choose life and love my power my presence extreme discernment and get understanding these days will come quickly and your life will change day by day so all who hear this message if you are my son or my daughter if you have received my son and repented of your sins these words are for you do not walk around with your head held down but lift it up where your help comes from even if people laugh they will not be laughing for long pray for those who have chosen the darkness and are expecting it to win some will take their life when they lose because their souls have been compromised by the lies they've been listening to guard well the layers of your soul what you put there and always choose life i love you says your god amen yes [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh it is hard to stand i won't fall i'm sure my angels are behind me i don't want a stool what is that no no but we could just lay hands on everybody and end it [Music] it's pretty pretty hard to top god and for those of you who don't think this is real may he come to you when i walked in the angel of the lord who looks just like jesus came in behind me to make sure i wouldn't fall down before i got up here and god's been speaking to me like the last several hours before i got here and some people think why is she late why is she late well are you going to turn around and say no to god i was right on time [Applause] god was very wise calling me a revelator instead of a prophet because he knew all the bashers wouldn't know what a false revelator was he was very detailed with me before i started traveling and speaking and he'd already warned me about a lot of stuff that would happen or would be said which i understand people don't understand what they don't know or they have not experienced their self it is hard for them to receive it seeing is not believing receiving is believing god has given me many titles i didn't ask for any of them and many people say i want to be you i go no you don't you don't really and i've heard people say he chose seven men before he chose you no he didn't he did choose me he knew me when i was in him he knew every one of you already knew what you would become and on your soul that he created he wrote if he would be male or female no matter how man says how that happens and your soul will be conflicted if you're told you're something else because your soul already knew what it was supposed to be but if the ones who wanted to take over have their way they would let anybody choose whatever they want to but god has a plan you were with him before you came to this earth before this world was made before he stretched out the universe the physical realm over the spiritual realm that's why when it says in revelations he will roll it up he knows where the ends are he had to put something out there that he could put physical things on because all he had the original realm is the spiritual realm the unseen realm unless he lets you see it from the time i was little i was a seer i saw the good guys and the bad guys i saw activities of the spirit realm you hear people talk about angels and demons there's much more than that all around you there's buildings built that both sides use depending on what is going around in that area there's platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places how do they get in high places they earn it by hunting for souls for the enemy these are wicked spiritual beings however when you learn to command an army that was created to pull down every stronghold of satan they're the ones who war against hell no matter what level of wickedness they operate in they can shred those platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places and they go through light buzz saws and they can't stop it from happening because we who have the flesh you're the ones who have authority in the earth every spirit would be coming from hell trying to take over they use people like they apparently are right now but they cannot do it they can't the earth is made for men and those who receive jesus christ you're called to rule in the spirit realm when you take authority and dominion in the spirit realm it then impacts and packs this physical realm and because we haven't known how to do it to his fullness satan has just taken all he wants to done what he wanted to kill who he wants to put fear in who he wants to we're not tolerating it anymore jesus clearly said the things i did you will do and greater things you will do than i did so you should be trying to stop the storms we can help you do that you can either email or call our office and ask for weather warrior information that's god's name that he gave for this group who's willing to step out and just do what his son did i didn't pick that name we are to take authority over any form of destructive weather and whether you know it or not in the word of god when he made the ocean and he made the land he told the ocean i set a boundary right here at the land and you will not pass over that's god's word that's his decree we are his sons and daughters it is our job to uphold that and tell those storms you will not cross over on the land or do destruction he created the weather to nourish the earth not to damage it so we sit down here and say god come and rescue us come and stop this and he's looking down saying i gave you authority you have authority you rule because the enemy knows he can get in and twist any of those weather system and use them the best he can because he comes to what kill steal destroy and one of the ways he does that is with the weather so volcanoes are not supposed to be erupting tsunamis are not supposed to be destroying none of that stuff that's going on but there's been no voice or agreement in the body that they would no longer tolerate that he taught the disciples how to multiply food how to travel in the spirit realm how to take authority and dominion over all the power of the darkness cast out any and all demons to pray for the sick to be healed why are we tolerating the virus because i'm not it has no right here the body needs to wake up stand up and step out you can wake up all you want to he wants you to do all of those things and i can tell you right now the meteorologists don't know what's happening they're going wild we even have some of their briefings where they talked about what is wrong with this weather they're almost afraid to give a forecast of anything because it never happens and then they faked it they faked it to prove these things were happening those weren't even the storm that was going on those in the area that the storms are headed to have the greatest authority if you're a believer so those on the east coast we have melt we have built a wall and if you go back and look at every storm that's come after dorian when we told it we all started saying you will not and cannot cross over the boundaries god set for you and all the way down not just in florida where we started it all the way up the east coast believers are standing saying you will not cross over and do destruction and every time a storm comes you can go look at it it comes a certain way then it hits the wall and goes back out and they don't understand it's simply the body of christ taking authority so when we learn oh hawaii has got it down we have a lot of friends there's a lot of weather warriors that live in hawaii it doesn't even get started before they get out there and they start i'll never forget the time that this massive like i think was category 5 was coming and i had been teaching and talking to him about taking authority and we all declared that this storm will not be allowed to come ashore and the head of it would be taken off and when everyone went to bed except me because they don't sleep at night when they all went to bed when they woke up there was nothing but shreds left and they couldn't understand or get it because they knew for sure that the the island would be consumed and those people those whether foreign would not let up that prayer of agreement we had they said we don't know how it happened but it looks like the head was taken these are the meteorologists saying this the head was taken right off [Music] it was a nothing and one reporter said never in 25 years of being a meteorologist i ever see i never saw that happen i'm still trying to go back over all the tapes all the information that we've accumulated to know exactly what could should have happened and it didn't happen why because they're not tolerating it so whoever lives in the gulf better stop stepping up is not coming to florida i live there and i'm not putting up with it anymore [Applause] you need to just get fed up what yes whoever has the fires in your state you better start saying you're not tolerating it anymore you come into low pressure system to form and come in and put the fires out [Applause] that is not something new in the bible they called forth rain to come and they begin to see the clouds form did it come and did it rain why are we any different than them it's called believing your faith and guess what in heaven you'll need your faith not to pay your rent not to be healed not for any of those things but to begin to create who is our father do you know in the bible when it says let us make men in our image that's what they look like like with the glory on them the light of god on them but after our likeness is how they operate we're supposed to operate like them we are not god you don't want to be god i don't want to be god i've seen alone but i still don't want to be god no one's that many kids the devil actually isn't god's problem it's how we all operate and stand against them he should be running does it say he will run from us do you remember that scripture you submit yourself under the hand of god and resist the enemy what will he do he will flee from you he's talking to you you do you know the word resist doesn't go oh no no i don't know what this is i will not tolerate you you're a liar and a friar and i serve the most high god only him and he'll run there are people the demons beg not to be assigned to because when they come back and they're not successful with their assignment they get punished the devil doesn't give anybody rewards not even his own he just punishes them when they don't listen so they don't want to they'll lie they'll do anything they can they don't want to and by the way when you learn to release the anointing they burn and it hurts they'll burn if they get near the fire of god it will burn them like it's going to melt them they may live in hell's fire they don't want god's fire why baptism and fire is coming [Music] [Applause] see i was raised on the word of god god chose when my birth would happen on this earth he chose my father's my mother's by the way my mother is here tonight she'll be 90 next april she had 15 children i am number three and my sister's number 15 right there and any of them could testify to anything i'm saying i never was normal i didn't want to speak to people even though i didn't want to speak to people i didn't want to hug them i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you know my little nice apartment somewhere and do big business he took me out of my world of business yeah it's like he didn't know we need to pay checks seriously he did this he always told me before he would do something with me my grandmother was my dad's mother was a powerful woman of god she was in the jungles of panama and was afraid of nothing ever she'd come to her home on sabbatical i mean we had more kids than anybody she could have come any anywhere i don't remember she had eight or nine of her own our aunts and uncles so she had a lot of children but she always came to our house because god was there we knew she could see through the walls we knew she could see right inside of us and every time she came she'd lay her hand on her head you will serve and know the most high god and my brother would run and hide i'm not going to be a missionary and be eaten by the alligators or crocodiles no right now they lock him on death row to minister to death apprentice prisoners he's invited by hell's angels to come and do funerals i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles anymore my mom would tell me every day you are so strange i don't know what god's going to do with you i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day my whole life i would know things my siblings didn't care too much for that my dad was a great mentor that his own mother in the jungles of panama on her own they had a murderer loose in the village i know some of you heard the story before but it just shows you who she was she was on the mission field in the little hut somewhere where she was ministering and she i think she lived there for i forgot how many years many years and everybody was boarding up their windows to keep this murder from out she left her window open and she went to sleep right in front of the window because guess what she knew god sure enough late at night here comes a foot in the window and this huge machete coming with him and she turn around look at him and she goes freeze in jesus name and rolled over and went back to sleep and three hours later when the police arrived he was still frozen that was my grandmother i was taught to never be afraid i knew there was a god i knew there was his son i knew there was holy spirit who is my best friend that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a day that's what that means let me speak to you 24 hours a day but lots of times he's tweaking you he wouldn't warn me something's going to happen i don't think i'd do that that's what he says to me i don't think i'd go there so i'm not going to go there okay i don't ask him why but you have to have your ears open to listen and it's really good idea if you say i choose holy spirit to give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention it is one of the most powerful things you can say anybody here let's just say it together holy spirit from this moment on i give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention so be it there you did it i did that when i was really young it saved me a lot let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen she'd come up here now she would preach all the time she knows that's true because he does the same thing with her every morning it's called living a new life heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a lifestyle so if you want to live on earth as they live in heaven you need to learn to live heaven culture what is that how they live in heaven and living the same way on the earth they're free of fear free of lack free of grief free of anything of the enemy never sick they go well they're in heaven yes they are but our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come by the way that is heaven your kingdom is heaven you're speaking to the father right your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven that is heaven culture you are literally praying a prayer that asks for heaven culture and he's released it on the earth you choose it you lose everything under your soul that's not him every trauma from the past every wicked evil disgusting vile movie you've ever watched with your eyes it's in your soul it's why he says to guard it for out of it will flow the way you live your life as a man think it's in his heart which is your soul not talking about your human beating heart the heart also means the core or the center of something that's your soul that's what you are you are a living soul and what you fill it with is what you will become that's why people you've known all your life kind nice people i know some of them who now hate with a hate i've never seen before in people they hate and despise don't even know why why they listen to the fake news and for years they have filled their layers you have layers whatever you feel the most of is what you're going to begin to act like so if you don't like you change what you're watching even what you say goes in your own soul so if you don't like you you've been telling yourself that for years and you put another layer of it in you and what's in there is what you will think about and if you think about it you're going to choose it if you choose it you're going to do it again that's called what criminals do this is true that's why a criminal will get out of prison go commit a crime and go back right back to prison if they've been there 20 years it'll you know why it's in their soul and i've been to prison to talk it's good to hear that and i had 80 prisoners and they had somebody guards trying to watch they never watched they listened to protect me my husband was with me sitting up here staring at every one of them but then even he was crying and i told them how they were sought out by the enemy even as a little child they had a great call on their life so he didn't want them to be loosed on the earth they might find out who they are and do destruction to his plans so he gets them into crime this is truth he gets him into crime when you do it it was in your soul then he makes sure they get caught and then they get put in prison where they can't be a threat to him so every time they get up because it's in them guess what they do it doesn't matter how much therapy they give them how many classes they take them to if they can't get it out of them they'll think about it they'll do it and then they're back in the same place so i told them the story of their life this is what you're doing this is why you're doing it this is what god had for you this is what satan is doing to you and will proceed to do it to every member of your family if you can then they begin to cry then they get furious you get mad at the devil then they get born again filled with the holy spirit then it teaches them how to war i teach them how to send heaven's army so now insider prisons are very dangerous people who are dangerous against hell i mean anybody could go to prison right but why are these people in rhythm they are dangerous because of their destiny and satan doesn't want them loose your soul is very important to you don't ever forget that you choose with your soul all day long you choose christ right after that you should choose what he chooses all day long you should guide what you choose what you watch what you say i love that little saying these half years what would jesus do what would he say what would he choose it's actually a very free life to not sin people get shocked when they say i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's not you choose not to you just say no say no to who was ever asking you sorry my soul is too important i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really think you were weird who cares because when they start to die they'll call you to pray for them they'll look for you if it's on their deathbed hey you know about heaven i need to go there they'll forget they made fun of you that's why it's important that you not suffer trauma for 30 years after it happened you know who's doing that the devil because you saw it or experienced it and he will replay it and replay it stop the video stop it stop it stop it and lose it from your soul jesus and after your will because of jesus to lose it from your soul he'll come down and pull it out and it will literally be like it never happened to you [Music] i've seen too many people set free and they went from being you know in the dredges of despair suicidal they'd have these dreams every night about the torment or whatever it was the trauma they went through and three minutes with me and the revelation god gave me while their husband their pastor went in the store to get me some things to eat i was invited to speak his wife was set free she was a different person when he came out and then she brought her 17 year old and her 11 year old sons to me because they were present when she was abused so much they lose out of all their soul and they haven't never six years later i've never had another nightmare or torment you can be free the truth makes you free and the truth is you can be free even from heroin from witchcraft homosexuality doesn't matter what it is from the enemy you choose with your will to be free and yes we pray for people to be free from homosexuality which is a spirit and guess what they have powerful destinies every one of them the devil targets the ones who have the greatest destinies to bring freedom or liberty to people and he wants to keep them from doing that so he gets them distracted sidetracked on the wrong path filled with lies believing that's how god made them but remember when he made them he wrote on their soul this is who you are this is what you will be and he had plans for them from that moment i will tell you this there is a move coming to them and millions of them will get born again [Music] not not not just a few millions he'll move on them they'll know who they were he'll know the entire time it was a lie and they will repent from it reject it completely and run into god's kingdom and they'll be great witnesses i will also tell you this millions of muslims are about to expect they will experience salvation god is still into saving people number one thing make sure you belong to him if you get saved at least you're going to have it a lot of people have it happen on their deathbed and the family member said i never saw it happen so you think it didn't happen did you believe they would be because the number one thing besides getting jesus you better believing that your family members will know jesus christ give their life to him and be with you in heaven there's a reason why you should do that you have the greatest influence in the spirit realm over their life as family members and jesus the first time he took me to heaven said there'd be so many in the earth to be shocked when they get there to see who's up there and yet they were the very one who prayed and believed for their salvation we have so many promises as a believer we as the body of crisis will see an example a living walking breathing taking authority dominion releasing life to people and let them see you happy and joyful while you're doing it maybe they might want jesus one of the biggest things i know it will happen eventually the world will know us the body of christ by our what our love for each other stop fighting the plan of the enemy dividing conqueror is his plan and in this whole last year several years before the virus it's not a plague and it is not a disease even in the natural viruses come and they go but people act like they are i'm not saying you can't protect yourself if you want to i'm not tolerating sickness or disease i'm not tolerating it every time you bless your food i hope you're blessing your food i won't ask for a show of hands my daddy let us eat after we blessed our food and then he added things the prayer went on forever i know where he got it from because when his mom came off the mission field she would have a 40 minute prayer at the dinner and she knew without open her eyes if you were going to leave the table and then she'd pray for you blessing your food is a very powerful thing because it says when you do that and you ask he will take sickness far from you so if you haven't been doing it do it that means he won't allow it to come to you or your home that's what you've got an interpretation you won't allow it to come to you or your home if you are declaring that when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes long but you know i added a few things i will hold my plate up in the restaurant or anywhere else look at father doesn't it smell good and i'm gonna enjoy every bite of it so bless it to my body and may the isis have a never-ending crisis may hell have triple trouble in hell as long as i'm alive i thank you for blessing all those who serve you who know you who love you amen so if we go out together after i'm invited and that pastor says will you bless the food who's ever with me will go okay and what are they gonna do here i'm picking up my plate are they going to sit there and just stare at theirs lift it up everybody [Applause] i'm training you to blush your food that you actually can have food and actually can eat the food amen many countries can't do that but we can remember that the next time somebody asks you to say blessing i challenge you to do it do you know why because it was a day when i was in my late teens and i was saying my rope prayer father thank you for the soon blessings in my body and my swelling was named my person thank you wayman did you even hear those words and i literally heard from heaven this is before he started taking me i heard like a rubber stamp wham 500 billion 260 million eight hundred and ten and 0001 can you say something else that we might actually be excited to hear he really said that to me so from that day i have never blessed my food like that it's a habit that's not a blessing that's not a blessing it's a habit right you need to get god excited father i thank you for this amazing food smells good looks good i can't wait to see what you're going to do with me next i am so ready who cares what people hear at least they'll know there's someone around that knows god my little sister gave her famous blessing i think she was four or five and we were all huh not jen one of our other sisters i have eight sisters and seven brothers and an alligator named charlie but he's in heaven he doesn't have to live in a bathtub up but i've seen him in heaven your pets i'll go to heaven be nice to them they'll remember you and they'll talk [Applause] [Music] and i already hear some people's heads it's too late to tell me that's not true you haven't been there because if you did you would know that why not did you know that many animals actually have a spirit in the soul go back to genesis and read when noah back in the day when my meetings would be six hours long i'd do three or four i was just like like this and i would call let's see i called them i have called noah moses and adam and then one time i called him noses because my head was so tired i couldn't remember and every time i knew that everybody emailed me i don't think you know who actually put people on the ark and then we get phone calls and they go yeah she knows she blew it okay she knows this is moa and noses and noah because you know she couldn't really remember if you go back and read that you know what i'm telling this is what the father told me this is how he taught me like a little kid because when i go to heaven i'm like eight years old with pigtails and he actually talks to all of you like children man is the one who likes to expound and make things totally not even understandable or approachable but god doesn't talk to us like that so he talked me said i'm going to teach you something and why because i've seen pets in heaven and i'm like wow there's every one of my pets they were in this long line and they were on my father's ranch in heaven and they started with sally the pig and i got i got corrected because i said there was pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the pig he was a family pet gave them to my father when he retired from the ministry it was this big when it died it was 1100 pounds i saw her in heaven and her were two little mice that we had in new york city when you were allowed to have pets they lived in the wall they were residents so we just kept them i recognized my brother joey's duck name max that he had when he was nine charlie the alligator that i've always talked about we all had in florida we live in florida and he lived in our bathtub and we had to take it out and clean the tub and he'd wander around the bathroom every goat bird fish snake lots of them spiders and iguana named iggy i saw every single one of them in heaven every one of them a long line as long as you see following my dad walking around on my dad's ranch and the father took me to the stone he said i need to explain this to you because people will argue and they're not god so they think they know better than me but if you go read the scripture in genesis where i told noah to put the animals on the ark and then he took me further you know even closer further away at the beginning of time when he made adam and it talks about how you know god the father and jesus were both there by the way the father said adam jesus stepped out of him that's what the word always did he stepped out and made his body but there was no life in him until he did one thing the father leans over because the father carries life he leaned over and breathed adam's spirit of life that was his spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual body into his nostrils and he became a living soul and i went oh yeah i've always known that he said but you didn't never connect it to noah go back and read this scripture in genesis and i did and do you know what it says that god told noah to put every animal on the earth that had a spirit of life in it you don't have to believe me believe the word that meant those creatures had souls and a spirit body oh that's from god i can't take credit that's how revelation happens it changes the way you think so people will argue with you it's too late it's in the word so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul i think they just they go die and go to hell with the flies [Applause] they came from hell they can't have a soul right but i did learn that all your pets go to heaven and then when one would die i'd actually see my angel take his spiritual body and take it to heaven your own guardian angel takes your pet's spiritual body and takes it to heaven and they live in your mansion they will be eating at the table when you get there they will not be eating off the floor anymore so people go it doesn't say the word animals are in heaven it says creatures preach the gospel to who what to what i preached the gospel to every pe i had i was gonna make sure they made it creatures remember around the throne the living they have bodies like animals but they're not they're highly intelligent have always been with god like melchizedek who had no father no mother no beginning or ends there was more than father son and holy spirit i always say father word and holy spirit and so melchizedek has always been with him he is father's personal high priest thank you not one of adam's sons he's not a human that died and went to heaven he's always been with him i've seen a syllabus this big that tells you about um what is it what is that one thing they talk about well number one they always talk about the stone god will give you when you get to heaven and you always see on the syllabus a river rock with some big long name because he will give you a nickname the only he and you know and that white rock is a white diamond is not a river rock the word rock in heaven means gemstone because he's not cheap or poor right when when you get married you give your the toes a ring with a diamond in it or some beautiful stone right he's old bran so get ready for your pets to be in heaven amen and they'll be with you for all eternity so i keep telling people be nice to them they'll thank you for how often you let them out or fed them the food under the table you weren't supposed to why do you think they try to eat it off of the table later when you're not there you spoil them so when he said heaven is beyond anything you ever thought or imagined it is unless i like the word unless it be revealed by his spirit so the spirit of god is the one who catches me up all the time without warning me i fall in the driveway i'll go to heaven i'm in the grocery store reaching for something he takes me to heaven my family know because they'll come in to talk to me and there's nothing in me this my spirit man's in heaven the holy spirit climbs and keeps my body alive my husband is so used to it of 43 years he'll come in and say something to me i don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't look down and watch what people are doing are you kidding i'm listening to what god is showing me but my husband will say these words oh i'll come back later he is he is scottish he's not moved by anything even as his wife's body is sitting there not breathing he is not concerned see he picked the right person for me i remember the first day he saw an angel walking down our hallway and he freaked out although i've talked about them thousands of times he actually saw one he's like nothing would come out i said oh did you see the angel he never doubted he just never you don't sit there and cry because he doesn't get to go he's happy i go and he's happy i speak don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll get a joke and it will be a scottish silk that you'll never get the ending to you'll never get the punchline but if you ever want to fish and catch big fish that is a gift god gave him when he sent him from himself he made him a fisherman that's his passion that's his greatest thing besides me and jesus and guess what i hate yes i hate fish let willy be free i don't want him in my freezer in my home in a frying pan or on my table they're slimy they stink they smell and i don't like i don't like them so if i went fishing he'd have to take it off he'd still be here in jesus game and i'm not touching that fish and do you think god knew this of course he knew it of course he gave some of me somebody with five layers in their soul that's like a rock and you aren't ever changing that man i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can say loves jesus hears very clearly gives me words from god all the time little scratches of paper but doesn't talk about it so he gave me somebody who doesn't care about talking or want to talk thank god right because we'd be wearing each other out i pray for people spouses want to see they both minister and they're wanting the microphone [Applause] i have no competition yeah well my sister kind of makes up for her the baby who said she'd never talk to anybody but but taught 15. how many kids you haven't used to class 16 two-year-olds for about 15 years now she's braver than me i don't want to do that i don't want to catch fish and i don't want that either but she's really good at so that's why she's writing all the children's books and they're amazing our artist is every time he gets time he works on it every child around the world will know there is a heaven there is a god and what life is like there and the last place i was taken that was new was called whimsical way it's up in the celestial realm the sky of heaven and any little child who wants to in heaven either climbs into a bubble gets on the bubble train and takes him up to this amazing place parents don't have to go and they have all these creatures little creatures that are their friends and one day they'll be part of our amusement park we've made so heaven has got lots of plans for kids fun you're probably one of the first congregations i told this to it was amazing these little creatures had names they were wearing clothes they were friends to these other kids and they would all go up there whenever they want to and play and play and play and have fun create little things and then they come back down because you live with your parents or your grandparents or whoever is the closest in relation to you when you get to heaven no child is left alone we should celebrate who we are that is your destiny and the new earth i get a lot of flack from that get over it you're not god he's going to make a and say new say new means new he's already remodeled this one several times already he has yeah and when you get to heaven everybody gets to see when he made it you all learn how he made the earth the first time how it got messed up in verse two think about it verse one verse two how did that happen so quick in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that means it was done say don imperfect then wine number two is it a mess why is the water on the land and the sky why is it trapped underneath all that stuff why is the earth all split up why is it in darkness the first one he didn't need the son or the moon yet he made him yet no he lit it with his glory we should study the book of jeremiah he turned the light out at one time satan was making the earth a wilderness rick knocking nose but really when he made it the first time it was perfect and he lit it with his glory there was no evil on the earth at that time and then of course you all know satan lucifer was cast out of heaven down to the earth and he thought he was going to take over he's tried so many times i don't know why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs became evil because they got possessed and used and i know people talk about i don't know where they get these things from reptilian seed because god made the donors dinosaurs not satan oh you don't even want to know about their children you don't need to know about okay it doesn't have anything to do with us man comes up with their own head knowledge and understanding of something and there are no nephilim on the earth right now i assure you there aren't any so there's too much really to talk about all that you've already got what you really needed when the first 15-20 minutes you have revelation that a lot of people don't know what's going to happen you heard like uh i know 24-year plan but really actually heard about a 50-year plan i've been taking over 100 years into the future and the earth was still here and it was good it was really good so each generation until god's ready to stop things it'll get stronger they will manifest more they'll be in charge more and children will probably be the first ones who command a mountain to jump into the sea and if they want to put it back they will because we go from where this is not glory to glory glory to glory glory to glory this is us now glory to the pit glory to the pit glory to depression glory to lack glory to lack that isn't the way it goes it goes from glory to glory to glory that is an upward motion in authority in dominion in joy and celebration and the earth being well a hundred years from now it will be like that so forget stop trying to make plans to escape i don't want to escape i want to be here i'll be here the whole time and the people well jesus comes tribulation comes all over no it's not you don't know the bible because jesus gets he will get his thousand-year reign and god's not keeping that from him why would he he's going to sit on that throne in jerusalem and be king of the world [Music] for a thousand years and it's still not over because satan will be in a big pit oh yeah there will be no weapons on the earth during that thousand years people will live to be seven and 800 years old because christ is sitting on the throne and there'll still be people who aren't saved so that means people will make it through the tribulation the whole earth will not be destroyed in the tribulation and everybody won't be killed off the earth as there'd be no natural people for jesus to rule over when he system that's owned in jerusalem at the end of the tribulation right yeah who's he going to rule who's he going to be in charge of and there'll be kings and countries that don't want him there can you believe that they must have the must be unintelligent i'll be polite it's not what my flesh wanted to say they will be as unintelligent as the devil they will not want him and they'll know he's the son of god he just wiped up all the all the wicked evil armies right he won like trump won not that he's god but look at him he won and he thought this is going to be easy breezy and never has every devil around come after somebody so harshly they hate him because he stands for justice liberty and freedom but they really hated him when he became really dangerous and said i'm fighting god back in your country that was it that was it the devil went crazy he's not going to stay in that seat i'll impeach him i'll declare him incompetent other people rise up all over you know what they want a civil war here for a long time they want all of us to run the streets and kill each other and i've told them i talked to them sometimes do you not understand a true american they actually want life they want a future they have a family they don't want your garbage go to a third-world country and live if you want socialism go where they have dominism we're not going to have it here why the people don't want it [Music] you don't want it and they'll make it sound like it's amazing they'll make it sound like it's beautiful go to venezuela they're living in dumpsters if they can find one that's what happens i grew up because of my natural age i've been through many generations of time on the earth i remember the turmoil of the 60s when people wanted to have nothing but love and or war then they didn't want to go to war they didn't want to do nothing i remember that but i also remember doing we would do these what do you call them when you have to do little see my earth mine doesn't work so well not projects this one you would hide under your desk in case the russians were coming to get you anybody here have to do that you were practicing if you were going to be bombed by the russians what's called the cold war it's pretty cold on that floor under my desk and when i was like eight nine ten they all did it they'd stop and they would let the alarm go everybody would just by habit oh drop what you're doing crawl under your desk and hide in case the bomb would hit we lift like that until it was ended okay so you don't want to live in russia i've been there the sadness is so horrific i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go unsure i could feel it and see it like black clouds of evil and that i could feel with the people with the great deep sadness and grief that they had no freedom because if they take your weapons the criminals aren't going to give up theirs you wonder where their heads are right and who in the world wants to do well i know this is political well you have to give it up because tomorrow that's what you're really going to get god is very politically minded he doesn't want that he only wants that who in the right mind which shows you they probably don't have one anymore wants to defund the police i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in california or washington or oregon or new york chicago i could just go down this list who in their mind having had no freedom for five months would vote in the same governor or the senators or the people who didn't care if their places were being destroyed where does that come from i promise you i won't tell you some of the things the president is going to do as soon as he gets he'll reelected tweaking some governors i'll just say that much and some mayors and getting laws changed [Music] because people even the ones who voted him and don't want them now because they who won't allow are having all the freedom they want to do what they want to and they're openly showing what's in their soul that's the point of all this god is exposing the souls the people and they can hide and smile behind their big office but when it comes push to shove what's in that soul is coming out and people couldn't believe it when it started happening what is wrong with those people are they insane because their people don't have liberty freedom and there is no justice there is no protection there's no food there's no jobs people's houses get broken into when they want to do you know how many people i want to tell you how many people have moved to florida we are being crushed with people every day because they were seeing us on the news having liberty freedom and justice enjoying our beaches we were as good as we could be to work along with the quarantine but we had fresh air everywhere we went you could open your door and have fresh air and people saw that and went i'm not staying here no more so they're moving out and that should obviously you would think would show the head of that person who's in charge they don't like this they're leaving that means no votes that's right now no one's going to want to vote them back in you want to go through that again and no tax money you're right no tax money to take care of anything it's a mess it's all free if they say give it up give it all there give it all to us we'll just take care of you don't even think that's what's gonna happen you gave away your destiny your future your home your rights your rights your rights your rights that's what satan wants but he's not going to get away with it here say whoa to god so people have a lot of questions they'd like to ask me and we'd be here for 10 more hours and i wouldn't be sleeping people always invite me then if they ever ask me to visit their home they try so hard to stay up while i'm up and like falling asleep sitting next to me wanting to ask i don't do that anymore by the way i've actually spoken in um i remember the name of that great black university it's either maryland or washington dc i actually got to go speak there yeah george washington university yeah i did i was invited and they couldn't squeeze the people they couldn't get them they gave us a small room then bigger room in a bigger room because the students asked for it and they have to say yes and they had so many crammed in there you couldn't hardly breathe and the next night there was even more and i was staying in the home of this family nobody could stay up they're like i gotta go to sleep and i'm still sitting here you know in heaven you don't have to sleep people go i always wanted a bedroom done a certain way well you'll get it he'll make it for you to make you happy it'll be your lounge room your meditation room you don't need to meditate when you're living with the one that you meditate about your mansions are amazing some are under the crystal sea some are up in the skies of heaven they have a rain forest in heaven these 12 massive trees that could hold some i've seen mansions the size of new york city one one mansion probably belonged to an intercessor seriously somebody you never knew or heard of you know they prayed in every move of god until they were going on they're probably still praying when they were leaving and i like to tell these young people you may be living your life you want to but if you have a grandma in heaven she's going to pray the fire of god down on you because send the angels of heaven to pursue you and talk to the holy spirit non-stop you may as well get up here roll over and lay down and give up right now because they're gonna get you you'll listen to the prayers of your grandma i was in a where it was a fireman's sub i'll talk anywhere and somebody made a comment about my hair which god picked not me i did not pick this thing here i was not a pink hair person oh no remember i was the one that wanted to just hide i want to be invisible i was okay with being invisible he said you're not going to be invisible you're not going to be hiding anymore that's what he said to me we need you to have pink highlights in your hair now i had probably about 40 pastor friends in my city and then they thought that was it i went over the edge knowing me not changed but my pink hair made it impossible to to be friends with well what is wrong with these people oh they have no clue they're they're in the flesh not the spirit this is a spirit test if you don't like it you're in the flesh you like it you're walking in the spirit so i don't ask for it but you can't hide so everywhere i go and pastors go i can't invite you my congregation would freak out if they saw your pink hair i said you just didn't know how many hours they watched of me on youtube and guess what they come to my meetings at the church next door to you i don't think they're not the ones who aren't ready i think it's you so because of this pink hair it opens up me to speak about heaven everywhere everywhere everywhere all day all day no matter where it is it's even happened here already it doesn't matter people are attracted to it while your hair is amazing yeah the pastor should hear that right get your evangelistic team to get color colored highlights in their hair and send them out into the streets and see how many people they can draw it's great marketing and so they will say hey your hair's cool yeah this is heaven culture what does that mean that means i know god he asked me to have pink comets in his hair i've been to heaven they all have highlights what and they never say this you're lying this is what i'm not a non-believer no matter how on drugs whatever it is they'll go what did it look like you know their souls kind of loosened up because they've been taking something and what's in there will come out what did it look like i've had meetings at the cashier where the lines backing up and they're listening the bad boys are listening the bad boys at the next one cashier comes over so they can hear well i'm saying it's because of this pink hair so i understand jesus when he said we need you to have pink highlights in your hair and he can read my thoughts and i'm thinking in my head why and he looked at me says it's if the lord of glory ever says to you with all the love he has his heart it's necessary i don't care what he wants then he just keeps he keeps going we don't want you to be hidden you can't hide anymore we're going to market heaven with that pink hair we want people to know the truth we want to know it's not boring it's exciting it's powerful it's amazing i want you to know as a believer the authority and dominion that you have in this earth and it's okay if you cut color highlights in your hair you look like heaven angels are different colors they're not just all pasty white glowing with white wings in a white gown some would probably make you crawl under your seat they have a band around their head with eyes and that whole band they have they have this this whatever thing they call this thing a breastplate thank you yes they have eyes all through them in the front and the back their wings are made out of electricity or lightning their faces are angular their eyes are diamond shaped if one comes in your room it's not from hell and some of them can look really fierce really fierce like i have two heads one facing this way one facing that way they both look front and back no matter where they're turning they can see some are weapons they don't need to carry weapons i'm more acquainted with the army of heaven than gabriel's group i've seen gabriel's group i know my guardian angel i've known him since i was little he's 40 feet high i won't tell you his name ask god would you tell me what my angel's name is so i could say thank you you're not worshiping him and they won't let you worship them and an army doesn't get worship they want commands they need orders like this army they have generals they have privates they have commanders all kinds of levels in the army itself but we get to command because jesus christ did they were made for us to command they don't protect heaven not one angel there's not one angel buildings not one was designed to protect heaven from who from who the army didn't even get to throw them all out michael held him while god zapped him with a lightning bolt from himself it says i saw a satan fall as lightning well one third of the angels went right behind him he kicked them all out that was his um intolerance no tolerance for evil or wickedness he doesn't want us to tolerate it either your words your deeds what you choose what you say especially declare yourself into the spirit realm how you go get a staff it helps ram i declare a state will not have my neighborhood i come in the host of heaven to get into every single home leave the life of god in there speak to every person while they're sleeping drive out every demon from this place because i'm not living near them and i will not tolerate them and i won't then i went from that to my city then i went to that to my state driving all the witches out please don't dress like a witch on october 31st you're inviting them harvest festivals are one thing don't participate with satan's holiday my daddy always told me it was wrong i said to my grandmother and one day we realized it is wrong why would he have a holiday he deserves nothing remember that when you get invited to something one day we in one quest will have the biggest festivals of light all over the world on october 31st we will celebrate life the life of god his plans and we'll throw a party everywhere we go and tell people what hell is really like and so is halloween you don't want it you're participating don't look at me weird i've been to hell you don't want to participate it's all real his plans his revelation his son holy spirit christ wiping up hell on the third day they were screaming and running he was melting the faces of the hierarchy of hell enjoying it why did it say he made a show of it he was putting on a show in hell god put a show on in heaven right when he kicked him out christ put a show on in helm when he wiped him all out guess who gets to put the show on on the earth we do we do because of jesus for jesus and with jesus we will put the biggest show on ever that is why he calls us his sons and daughters that's why he says we will manifest his absolute power and authority in the earth it is our right as a born-again believer having invited jesus into our lives when i was four and i asked him in i saw him step in me i was four years old don't discount your little kids i liked it so much when i was five i did it again so in book one i said i got born again at four on book five book two hey don't tell me there's five and book two i said i got saved to five and this woman who loved everything i had been saying and receiving it when she found out she said you lied this is a legalist minded person you lied you said you were born again at four and you said five you didn't even remember i said excuse me i did it twice maybe you should maybe you should do it again in the assemblies of god we got saved every week we did whether we needed to or not we still got saved oh the baptist did it all the time they're doing everybody's neighborhood in their yard it doesn't matter the baptists are great soul winners y'all they really are they're very bold [Music] but don't let the watchtower people come in your home they'll want to give you their watchtower magazine burn it or shred it it's false religion all false religions are run by one person that satan is called an antichrist spirit remember jesus talked about it that means anything is against christ's sovereignty and his his holiness of who he is his his anything is against that that speaks against that isn't antichrist spirit let's all stand up for a minute come back tomorrow i hope you come back tomorrow you hear about america a lot what'd you say wear red white and blue please i'll be wearing red white and blue i will and heaven will be wearing it too whoever watches whoever comes will i was recently in um not con carpenter's home church it was the name of the church in orlando calvary assembly of god i was there invited with a lot of other prophets who were taken out of their box because jeff jansen was in charge and he never has a program or a schedule you flow with him so all these great leaders are all sitting up on the platform and and jeff would just say get up there and start speaking and they're like they'd look at me because i'm a friend right he made me sit beside him or behind him in case i was the only one responding here's mike go go say something and they go what does he want to say oh you'll find out when you get up there then he calls us all said well what are we doing it doesn't matter let's just go up here and see what he wants to say it was powerful and we actually got to pray for the president because that was the the night i think it was released that he had was tested positive it was a it was it was a wild time because a lot of these people are like i've never done this before in my life you mean they don't actually have a schedule there's when is it going to end oh when he's done it ends when he's done he's flowing with the spirit of god it was a lot of fun it was powerful but most of them didn't know me and they looked strange but benny hinn turned around and shook my hand said i'm so glad you're here it was yeah his wife wants to be a new best friend suzanne she was excited about everything so you never know when god's gonna take you out of your box you may have been taken out of your box tonight but when you get to heaven it's going to happen anyway and even before that happens you can have encounters yes you need to be free [Music] amen be powerful don't ever ever be afraid don't ever be afraid so lift up your hands i want to bless you father i ask you to bless all of your sons and daughters who are here tonight or who are watching tonight may receive the blessing of the lord prosperity joy celebration revelation increase you better be yelling i receive it increase in every area of your life [Applause] restoration in your families [Applause] salvation for those who don't

let's honor cat as she comes this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] very good [Music] [Applause] before you sit down let's do something let's look up to heaven and welcome heaven how about that say father we are your children [Music] we love your son he lives in us this day we want to honor you and all those in heaven so we invite heaven to join us in this meeting so come quickly and enjoy the fun [Applause] y'all can sit down okay that's good well there's a lot of glory in here whoa yeah if you have never felt it it's real the more sensitive you are why do some people fall not fall it's not that something i want to do the more sensitive you become to him to jesus christ the more sensitive you become to the holy spirit and their presence because he's always with you and actually they're always talking to you when you learn how to tune that in tune the world out and tune it in you begin to hear them and it might be that still small voice but it's still them i always say them you hear me say them a lot i said it so many times someone said who are you talking about the trinity it's not one without the other right they've always been they've always existed they have no beginning no end i like the no end part i get crazy questions sometimes like will this all end and everyone just stop existing and went no way that's never gonna happen and you may never know everything about them because you'll always be learning and growing closer i'm talking about in eternity i mean you know you're actually already in eternity if you're a believer it's not like you're waiting on it okay it's just another season of your life but while you're here you have all got important commissions but if you're alive in this time you have extremely important commissions and one of those will be carrying the glory a lot of people i won't be talking about america obviously thank you everybody for wearing your red white and blue [Applause] the angels are in this room are wearing red white and blue just so you know that the ones that signed here especially because i asked would you please wear red white and blue god loves the red white and blue it represents his son i don't know if you ever knew that those stripes what do you think that represents it really does that's what it represents so the red and white and blue is his our president is his our country is his you ever wonder who to vote for always vote for life say life remember what god said i offer you you choose life or death but choose life right so this time it is about a man and god chose that man i talked somehow god talked mostly last night if you weren't here we actually heard from god himself speaking and he does that with me pretty often the more freedom in the atmosphere where i go the greater change you have of hearing from him because i didn't know he was going to do that but he has permission to use me any way he wants to i hear prophets say well i think the word of the lord is and what they need more maturity it's okay to open your mouth and let god speak and he does he does and he always will do that he loves to speak to his people but even people he'll speak to people who aren't his yet catch him up to heaven when they come back they want to know him they want to know jesus christ i know several times where things like that happen not in my meetings people haven't caught up a few times in my meetings mostly when they leave a lot of people see their guardian angel after they leave the meetings and that's okay don't worship them [Laughter] they won't let you that whole thing that has gone through the church for so many years uh it went from don't worship angels to don't talk to them have nothing to do with them and and yet in the bible itself not just the new testament in the old testament they actually had a little bit more freedom because there was no internet there was no fake news there was no liberals or legal list of people who said oh don't do that because they didn't know yet and and i can't i count on both hands how many and some weren't even like great men and women of god they were just people who god needed to do something and he would send angels why in the world do you think they have couriers now anyone who's been in a courier service understands how important that is heaven has courier angels they're under gabriel they're messengers couriers they have all types of angels worker angels uh ones that deliver things some that come and record things every person whoever got born again was recorded by angels is that important to god it was all recorded and not just what people saw with their natural eyes but what was happening in the spirit realm when you get born again the father son and holy spirit are all present when that happens because the father is fiercely loves everybody and if you could see with your own eyes i know when i was born again i was four i knew exactly what i was doing i saw jesus step inside of me i've always been a seer so i would not talk a lot about it to anybody when i was real little but i'd always see angels and sometimes the other guys you know so i'm not really afraid of them because i know that they're the losers and they have no power over me now i'm not letting them beat me up they're not going to kill steal and destroy anything of mine and that should be coming out of your mouth it's called ruling and taking dominion jesus said occupy until i come he didn't say stood on your rapture rug so the holy spirit had us make some pens that said roll up your rapture rug he actually came and said that tell everybody roll up your wraps your rug is not going to happen right now stick it in the closet maybe someone in the generations to come might want it you need to get your crown on it's more important to wear your crown than sit on your rapture rock because if you sit on the rapture road you'll probably never get to wear your crown or use it we all have crowns when you're a believer but what you do with that that that represents your authority and dominion when you get christ you get so many things but at that ceremony that's what heaven calls when somebody repents receives christ as a savior the father reaches inside of himself takes a stone of fire and puts it in that person's spirit man and that's what brings light it puts light in your spirit man that light can grow and grow and grow the more you pursue christ the more you obey the more you're willing the light grows and grows and grows and i can look at people and already know what have you been doing or yay [Laughter] some people are never told what you've been told what you're hearing but but from the moment we receive christ that is the first step the most necessary thing yes but after that you're supposed to run your race and go from glory to glory and you are more than a conqueror it's not like you're conquering you're taking the territory that christ already conquered for us to occupy means take authority and take dominion and take territory because we rule in the spirit realm but where you live the ground the air any water bodies wild around you anywhere you have rulership over all of that in the spirit realm you have a realm it comes with your christianity with your salvation and also at that time christ also takes something from himself the anointing he walked in this is all scriptural how about that this is the best part i know the word i was raised from the time i was a little baby my dad devoured the word and he actually lived it he loved his enemies like he did his friends so there was no skin color to us they were people that god loved and that we cared about very much we have adopted members of our family from almost every race my mom's sitting right there when people meet her i want you to be my mama so she had 15 but there's like 16 17 18 19 we ran out of numbers because they want to be a part of what we carry it's called love so christ reaches in himself and he takes a deposit of the anointing he walked in how do i know that because of first john 2 27 you see rick knows the walking bible back there if you want to know about a scripture ask rick he knows it and see rick i know this one the word actually tells you that it says when you receive jesus christ as your savior you receive a deposit of the anointing that lives and it abides in you guess what it doesn't go back to heaven it's given to you for a purpose it is a weapon and it's only yours it's yours everybody has one you're a believer but it's a deposit of the anointing he walked in so the father gives you something a stone of fire and you put more facets in it the more you do the more you grow the more you love the more you walk out the word and and carry the glory your facets the facets and that gemstone would blind the enemy that gemstone also has fire on it so here's the father giving you deposit of himself when you receive his son you get all of this you get all the holy spirit is right there all right he writes down okay i will begin to pursue them for me to indwell them but when you're born again he doesn't ignore you holy spirit is you can say holy spirit you don't have to say thee he's not an it he's a third member of the trinity he is also god right and they all have their they have their favorite things like we do their next favorite colors favorite foods jesus is just really got this serious thing about sweets he doesn't want deliverance from it though did you know he has his own mansion in heaven did he walk as a man on this earth doesn't he deserve one jesus doesn't live in this wrong room he visits much many many times he's there most of the time he's all around heaven saying hello to people you know just blinding you with his love and his glory but he actually has his own place and it sits in this field of these flowers that sing and worship him all the time now these flowers are like eight ten foot tall and you can't see the end of these flowers and his mansion is made very particular because he likes three things well he likes celebrations for sure but he likes sweets right he loves to dance he loves being with people so his mansion is different he's got one massive ballroom in it and all along the walls are these very beautiful probably made by him he still does carpentry in heaven all these wonderfully embellished tables and all of them have desserts on them he was raised on honeycomb and that never left him he loved going to weddings because guess what they always had lots of people sweets and they danced so because your mansion is made for you exactly the things you love the things you really love to do that you love to eat uh places and play i mean your mansion i've seen one the size of new york city so don't think you have a little cabin unless it's inside your mansion you know he'll do if you really want one he'll stick it in your mansion unless your mansion looks like you know a 50 000 square foot cabin most mansions don't have ceilings in them they don't need them it's easier for the angels to fly in and out or the creatures in heaven that come by to say hi if you have trees growing out of the floor that will talk to you and have conversations they come from the friendly forest does it say that the trees clap their hands it does and they really do so jesus has a one of the biggest places of celebration once you arrive and you have your welcome home party in the throne room and your family finally drags you out of there schambach stayed like forever some people just love being in that presence which is a massive celebration they don't have funerals in heaven they have celebrations and they have parties you don't need any alcohol you are drunk on the spirit all the time really people will step over you in the streets of gold because you're besotted with the presence and the all and the glory and the glory is one of the things i'll talk about this really i said god in the red white and blue it's really about the glory of what god's going to do with america i thought i'd share a little bit of heaven who's never heard anyone talk about heaven like that anybody if you've been there a lot you would be some people are afraid to i have a commission i have to share i i have a commission god came to me jesus christ came to me and said the father and i have decided to take you on tours of heaven that was over 20 years ago there's no way i can be normal when anyone dies i have a party inside the family doesn't call me unless they're ready to have a party because i've been at funerals and the and the ceiling is open and the person who died is looking at themselves in their casket your spiritual body goes to heaven your physical body is what rest right you're going to get it back you're going to get it back it's okay it's going to look really good and the day the dead in christ shall rise that is your body and your spirit man if you're already in heaven you're not going to miss that you can't you get it back first because you come in the clouds right with jesus you get your physical body first and anyone left on the earth that is born again they get their body glorified so it's okay to go home for half to heaven for some rnr because most people go i'm going to be here i want to be here when the rapture happens i'm like why are you going to know about it before anybody down here trust me they'll all know in heaven before it ever happens so i hope that helps some people they miss the rapture oh let me tell you they were raptured when they got here the moment you step from this physical body the presence of god and the love of god consumes your spiritual person you are seeing your guardian angels for the first time who never leave you they actually escort you to heaven and they've been with you your whole life yay i've always been nice to mine they had to put up with me growing up i wasn't bad i just wasn't a real happy person but anyway no i can see mine i see him all the time and when when god sends you into something new for him you get more okay you all have more than one because one has to stay here while the other one goes home for r and r remember what it says that your angel is always beholding the face of the father that's because one is here and one's up there at least many people have many and they come when you're conceived at the time of conception life begins because that is when your little spirit man is brought from heaven by holy spirit and he knits and attaches that little dot that little dot of flesh that's beginning to form in your mother's womb he takes your little spiritual man it's still you you've always been you just lived in god played like a little child somewhere about this big this big your different sizes you have these little shift things on you swim in the river of life you run up and down on the stones of fire you slide down the holy mountain you have a lot of fun you ride in and out on the rays of the rainbow that come out of him but you can't go any further you don't live in heaven somewhere you live in him in him we live we move we have our very being the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things what things when you lived inside the father why is he called the father why are we called his offspring i hope that makes sense to your head he carried us he carried us inside of himself and he said when i made the womb of a woman that's why i put water in it so it'd be familiar because you lived in him you played in the river of life he's very focused and the father is an extremely detailed person that's why he can put up with me my husband he gave me was probably the only person who ever could because he's got five layers to his soul he's happy if i love him and feed him and he can fish he doesn't have any more demands and so god picked him before he sent me he sent me first four years later my husband was sent into the womb of his mother but god picked us and he brought us together and 43 years later here we are he still loves me still loves food still loves fishing god is very detailed and focused when he made you and we are so amazingly made scientists still can't figure out how we can do different things how does our body operate the way it does it couldn't without a maker we didn't climb out of a slime pond the only big bang that happened was when satan was cast out of heaven [Applause] that's about it that's the big bang and it's not a theory it's the truth nope we have all been from the end of the beginning in the beginning beginning to the end when we lived in him because he went there is that what it says yeah and when jesus was called the word it was the father the word and holy spirit until the word came to die for us and was jesus christ his whole life changed i mean everything changed he had to change everything he was all spirit he didn't even look like he he looked different with flesh on um lucifer did not recognize him satan didn't recognize him lucifer that's who satan was before he fell was the most beautiful being in all of heaven god put gemstones all over him for a reason in his wings all just all over him when he would lead worship and the rays of glory would come from him they would hit the gems on lucifer and throw that rainbow like all over heaven he was anointed to carry that glory until he decided he wanted to steal it and you think about how long see heavens already had a war they understand the angels lost friends did you ever think about that they've been around together for a long long time and even though the army is very focused on what they do the army is the army they're called the hosts and if you met one they wouldn't want to be called an angel i know people who have met one more than one but the the army is the one i'm most connected with and god taught me to be a commander so you all could learn how to command god said command you me what he's saying is let me see you command when you learn in the word many times when it was either the fathers or the holy spirit whatever they said that was recorded in the bible sometimes if you turn the scripture around you see the whole revelation in it so if you take command ye me me i will see you command that's what he meant but so many scholars were freaked out that's revelation they were so freaked out why would god we cannot command him let's don't even discuss this don't you ever talk about this in your meetings because because and yet no ye not that ye are gods they don't want to talk about either that's with the little g that just means you can you you inside of you you have the ability to command the army of heaven only as a believer if you're not a believer none of these will you're here listening because you can't do any of it you must be born again to have this authority this dominion and all these things that god has given us if he says let's make man in our image and after the way we operate if jesus said i give you power over some of the power of the enemy say that loud then why don't we take it he says satan comes around like a roaring lion and coming to seek he can kill steal and destroy he didn't say he had the right to do it however it also says that he gives us mighty weapons he gives us weapons they that not an it you don't just give us a sword or a gun you know although it's okay to have those to defend yourself so i'm on the side of keep your guns and there's a reason why in this world you know while there's a devil who hates everybody and they have wicked evil people uh it's okay to defend yourself that's what makes us not a third world country it also makes us not communist and makes us not socialist that's called control that's called you have no life and you own nothing so those people talking about that stuff don't even know what they're saying let's send them to venezuela or russia let's send them to one of those countries let them have a week's vacation there they come back screaming we don't want to do that you have power and we have the right to rule and reign is says so besides the fact that he says you are kings and priests those are royal levels of authority and dominion those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion again if you're not born again you don't have any this is for the body of christ and all they're told is get saved and hang on to jesus comes and most denominations that's what they tell you go get people saved bring them in we'll pray they stay that way we are living examples in every sense of the word we don't have to tolerate anything from hell or anything from the enemy you know why because guess who didn't say jesus christ if we are joint heirs having been in law for eight years in my life i got a big lesson on what that meant and you all know why is it called the new testament that was his last will and testament that is a legal document sincerely of your rights and your inheritance and your abilities and your authority what he put in there's what we have and they stand up here just read them like they're really nice they sing their three songs and you go home totally unchanged unless you are personally pursuing a relationship with christ that's not who we are that's right we're not here just trying to get by we have given promises by jesus himself written in his word and is like if you took it to the court of heaven they would be saying well why aren't you doing this or saying this or why haven't you activated this why aren't you using their weapons what's wrong with the army of heaven are they not strong enough or have you not activated them in your life aren't you sending them against the enemy's strongholds trying to tear you apart and steal from you if you went up there without asking for stuff if you said explain this to me that's what you would hear well let's just unroll your bill of rights and clearly explain to you what we we should and then how to use them it is our job to train you you come to get trained if you're not trained you didn't get what you needed so people say you're going to start a church absolutely not thank you god in heaven i'm not a pastor one of the hardest jobs on the earth think how many kids you got right i already did that at home but you have to look at your life you have to look at your life a whole different way like what was christ saying what did that really mean is that something i have he said yes and the hard-headed man he was given because the father said i didn't give make it easy for my son then he takes me back in time and i get to walk behind the merry men and jesus on the way to go minister somewhere like i didn't have a vision and i never dream i don't sleep long enough i was there i saw people throwing rocks at the tax collector this is jesus's merry men following him he's trying to ignore most of them there is peter trying to yell at everybody about what they were doing wrong right this is exactly what they did patience that belongs to luke we're running down the road why did you give us up for him this is reality right he's been a physician for a long time he had a lot of patience let me tell you when you have a good doctor you don't want to lose them well he wasn't doing that anymore he gave it up but they didn't want to give him up this is exactly what i was showing and i went i'll never complain about my staff again and this is early on when he had his 12. the hardest ones to get roped in were james and john the sons of thunder that didn't mean thunder from god that means they were fighting all the time over pretty girls who thought they were awesome they had to get rid of the flesh when you think about what they became in a three short years it's absolutely amazing because no coach here on the earth could believe it could take that many people from different circumstances and ages and thoughts and everything you know and here was the son of glory saying i saw you when you were under the tree there earlier talking and said what he said that wasn't normal multiplied the foods there was so much left over from a couple fish which i don't like couple fish and loads of bread they could have had mine i would have given them mine baskets full left over now that was not normal was it when he disappeared into the spirit he stepped into the spirit room like this and he walked through the people when they were going to throw him over the cliff he actually said he passed through the people you know that right people go well he went around that's not what it says the orthodox jews knew he was a good man they thought he was a prophet they caught they gave him that benefit i know some they think he's a prophet and when he was having his meeting there after him they believe because i heard it face to face on a tour to israel uh which they hooked a mic on me and with steve schultz of elijah list they recorded every time i prophesied god said something somewhere and we were at the mount the precipice and so this orthodox jew was given his spin on it and he said yes the crowds wanted to kill him they didn't like it that he was good and he was doing good so they lowered a rope his disciples down the side of the mountain i saw the side of that mountain that rope would have been 250 300 feet long who's going to carry a rope around on a wagon right it's not like a little road and i'm thinking that's not even in the natural and so of possible all the believers are like just kind of staring at him but that's what they believe he let himself down no but then it was my turn to give revelation on where we were and i said well you all realize jesus as as the son of god although he walked as a man that is true he also was the son of god but even walking as a man he learned truth about the spirit realm the unseen realm it's a real place it supersedes the physical realm that's why angels and spiritual beings can pass through this wall they do it a lot sometimes you see them sometimes you don't but they have the ability but but jesus learned that he himself he was headed he had a spirit man inside he had a body but he already learned that he had access to that spirit realm so when this crowd came upon him this is all he had to do there are slits and openings everywhere if you step in you cannot be seen but you see everybody around you oh yeah like if i disappeared i would see everybody here i could hear you but you couldn't see or hear me so to you i would be invisible so what he did was when they were coming after him he just probably backstepped disappeared and he walked through the bodies of the people because the spirit supersedes the physical realm so he walked through the crowds right through their bodies until he got where he wanted to he stepped out of the spirit realm and there he was but guess what we are joint heirs and the things he did the works he did we will do also and greater things than that will we do there's now i won't tell this this is going from glory to glory there are requirements and some people don't like to hear that so people who are full of their self selfish spewing stuff these are christians i'm talking about because there's no way now i can tell you this the devil knows about the spirit realm and a lot of people in the new age movement have spirit guides those are demons and they'll take them in there but this is the thing this is why they're so insistent that that stuff is real they had a real encounter and because that doesn't mean what you're seeing is real that's why you must test every spirit and almost nobody says that or talks about that if an angel appeared in this room and said come and go with me i would say are you the spirit of the most high god who sent his son to die for the sins of this world and they can't lie so if he said yes i am the father has sent you i'd go with him if he said nothing or looked terrified i say get out i evict you get out i have nothing to do with you and that's what the basic probably one of the most important things that every believer will ever learn when you get born again because that's the moment the enemy really begins to pursue you he doesn't want you to be he didn't want you to know who you are see then then he's losing territory he's losing his impact he won't have a way to hold on to you or use you but this is one of the things jesus did he did it quite often he taught who fill up everybody say phillip say in the new testament philip travel through the spirit realm he would appear somewhere and then he would be gone he would be found in another place he traveled through the spirit realm just like christ did but people who sit in a church with the pastor doesn't have an understanding of the spirit realm the purposes god made it and what our rights are and how you do this is things you do you sent out assignments by god and and probably 20 40 50 60 years from now that might be a normal way of transportation let's say you're going to india to preach the gospel you may just step i don't know i don't know how he'll do it you could step in a certain room and then when you come out you're in india that was spirit realm you don't need a passport you don't need luggage and when you're done you probably turn around and step and you're back home this is our future [Music] now doesn't that make christianity a little bit more exciting there are people who are already connected with god with holy spirit and have an understanding of the spirit realm these people who just kind of astral project themselves out places that's something they're doing from their own soul it's dangerous you're out there with no one protecting you helping you and you're just bait the enemy can send these spirit guides if you do that and they'll take you to places and tell you all kinds of lies about where they're taking you and give you a commission because you had a real encounter you believe that was true and it wasn't so even some pastors who know are afraid to tell you should you misuse it should you misuse it or try it or something but it is our right to have an understanding of who we are so did jesus do those things and philip he's not the only one who travels but john did it all the time he left the isle of patmos when he felt like it you know why they put him there he wasn't even in a jail because that would be useless john they tried killing him so many times and they were terrified that he wouldn't die they couldn't even hurt him when they boiled him in oil he probably asked for a rubber ducky in the scrub bush john was sort of like peter at one time but now he spoke with confidence he knew who he was he knew he was under divine protection he was afraid of nobody so he would say boldly whatever god gave him when he went somewhere so that would be the best thing we can do is put them away from everybody on an island not realizing he was in the spirit on the lord's day which means he was in that spiritual realm when he heard the voice he looked up saw the door open and he was up in heaven the spirit realm is a place it is a place it's not just something you say but john who was the closest to jesus of all the disciples who never abandoned him not even at the cross that's why he gave his mother to john he had to die as his mother's savior not as her son that's why he said mother mom this is your son's son this is your mother he still recognizes that she birthed him in heaven she's highly honored not worshipped she's not she's not a deity [Laughter] she's very much loved because it took a lot had divine encounter with angels a good thing she was willing to listen to them right and then even joseph think about that that was tough when you do something great for god's surrender will always be required to some people that sounds like control and so they're afraid and if anybody's ever been in like a occult not occult occult that's satan's but a cult can be a christian cult you join it you live on land they get to tell you what to do and not to do it's still a form of control they think they're doing out of to help you but it's not some tell you who you can marry who you cannot marry i know people who were in one of those and they will not sign any kind of a document for anybody because they were under control when they got free they don't want they don't want to ever be controlled again by people so they're not a good thing either okay you don't need people to take you and keep you in a compound somewhere and run your whole life for you that's not god and they love and some of them love jesus and they may have their little church and worship and stuff but they have no rights really it's not a good thing it's certainly not god right so the i've known people who've been through that so they don't if you say well we have uh this we're having everybody to sign a covenant with us to be a part of what we're doing they won't sign it even though it has nothing to do with controlling them or anything they just won't do it they won't do it and i said well i'll just give you give you time pray for you you need to release all that from your soul and be free from that experience you had but especially if things hurt you or things happen to you and that it's not good you are responsible for yourself and the family god gave you and you're shaping i guess my sign to take a drink all this is coming to one thing it's about carrying the glory around america but i experienced last night yes god did step into me and i had waves i felt like this cloud came when i stepped out of the vehicle a cloud came and just i saw the cloud and i heard the father speaking so all the way in that's why i couldn't walk i didn't feel like i was here most of the time i didn't feel like even standing there if i moved and looked at somebody they would go they'd go like this and i have only encountered that one at the time when because this is saying what you're willing to talk about to people you're going to do it he needs voices to speak about the things he wants for us so they know this is something he has right if you're living if you're playing with sin it's not going to happen because you're a testimony right you're manifesting for him with these signs and wonders and greater works and he can't give those to people who are going to play in the darkness and go to church play in the darkness go to church and people know that and they see you doing this stuff they're it's gonna bring confusion so even though people have faked a lot of things they can fake being in the five-fold ministry they can fake all kinds of things one thing they cannot fake is carrying the glory or the fire and manifesting for god because he'll just take everything away so these are different days these are powerful days just doing the works is powerful like walking on water right multiplying food raising the dead who've been dead a long time you know or just maybe a few days who knows [Laughter] this is what i say if you're dead you're dead if he wants you you're not coming back if these are believers if he wants you or if he gives you a choice and you're in heaven be the hardest thing in their existence to be in the presence of the living god and his son in and holy spirit in heaven itself everything is alive there's more life there than anything ever so when they die their body does but they don't they step into real life they're very much alive declaring over you believing for you to be great for him instead of actually says in the bible if they could come back it'd be for one thing to be a part of what's going on now that's how important these days are and so i've been talking quite a bit about the days of glory it says that the knowledge of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea there's two things you need to realize there's two thirds of water on this earth that's significant when he says like the waters cover the sea that's much more water than land and what he's trying to say is you go many times over you will carry that glory you won't go somewhere and say glory come it'll be in you and it's released and it does huge things when you release it the knowledge isn't just oh it's the glory it's the understanding of what it is and what it does the knowing the understanding and the experiencing of it so you will do that and the glory grows in you like a cloud and at one point now this happened to me because i've been talking about it at this little place in missouri and went back to the products table and i started walking back and people started just falling and i'm like i could feel this power of god his power the glorious power it comes from him it's what's around him on the throne on the father his son carried it on this earth and so we we each get a measure remember things are given in measures but it can grow so i've been talking my son-in-law was with me handling the products table who's like an irish he's quite a character he's born again he's he's uh he is fearless and so he was a great addition to our family it took him to be able to marry my daughter who's just like me prayed prayed him in and prayed everybody else away i ran off every guy that was the wrong guy it didn't take much to make trips to heaven over time would you like to go one was a baptist boy bless his little heart my daughter is a seer she prophesies she knows all about these things i know she probably hadn't told you that uh and and i go to heaven all the time non-stop would you like to be able to do that this whole time he's backing up right it's getting big i said the kids you have will become prophets and seers they'll travel to the spirit realm they'll grab about one in heaven and just scare this little guy so much no i'm going to marry her she's going to have my 2.5 children i don't know what that and she will only do what i can tell i tell her she can do you have not known my daughter for very long that will never happen [Laughter] and i kept trying to show my daughter this this is not love it was like it was like they liked they liked the idea of being married don't get fooled okay you don't have to ask somebody if you are in love to somebody you cannot live without that's filled with god and you are so overwhelmed that the blessing god has given you if you have to come up and say do you think i'm in love [Laughter] no and so i told they were planning their wedding and everything and i want you're not going to be happy why don't you go visit his house and his dad was a fully in charge baptist he had to give permission to everybody around the table to speak oh yeah yeah her eyes start to get is this okay to tell stories on myself see i've experienced this self i know you don't want to meet the wrong person she comes back she goes i said how was it the food was good but i already knew because i'm a seer i can see where they are i can see what's going on when they're not with me how about that for a parent i know where you are right now if you don't get out of that movie i'll be there in 15 minutes we'll have revival in the theater and by the way there will be a repentance thing you can sign and take communion before you come back in the house that was growing up with me jen's raising her hand because jesus lived with me and my mom they loved me since 1999 so they know all this stuff they saw all this stuff happen she knows [Laughter] see i'm telling the truth that's what happens when you're here but it's the relationship i had and so i kept telling my daughter you're not in love you're not marrying that boy i'll lay down in the aisle well i'm telling i was telling all these things you know we'll have deliverance service serve all the baptists [Music] and i have very good baptist friends okay there'd be a lot of people in hell right now if i had meant for them but there's no way that with that was not a match made in heaven they'd be doing like this because my daughter is just like me in every way and out of the three the only one about heads with is guess who but they're raising their kids in the supernatural yeah so finally it's good so i told my daughter i'm going to fast dr pepper now that for me was like i'm pouring my life out right the biggest fast i could do because i only eat once a day there's not much to eat so i'm fasting dr pepper for three weeks at the end of that three weeks you will come to me and say i don't want him anymore but i have met this person at the end of three weeks guess what happened mom how do i break up with scott why did i think it was anything i have met ben she never said scott like that she never said scott ah scott's coming over [Laughter] yes bless his little heart he found him a nice little baptist girl and they're very happy just so you know that okay he didn't damage him and there was batten and i interrogated everybody who came up my husband laid back you know let's go fishing man [Laughter] it's the only break they'll ever get so when i met ben oh by the way in this whole process of realizing scott wasn't the right person she rebelled against him she got a mohawk [Laughter] her hair was like down here she got herself a mohawk and then the holy spirit had told her to put lightning bolts tattoo them on her sides get ready for kids for today y'all and she has uh gifted and danced highly i mean highly anointed and so when she was like 14 the holy spirit came to again and said i want you to put brass knuckles on your feet because they're weapons of god and they're like this long no she don't do anything little so she came and showed them to us after y'all and i went if god and god told me i did tell her to do that she's a sign and a wonder and she got to minister so many places and they she had red and purple hair i mean just just tell me she was so far out there in the heaven culture it was crazy she needed ben and the holy spirit calls him the irish boy with charmin blarney who pulls down you know he displaces principalities with the army of heaven and i went you were made for her [Laughter] it's worth standing in the gap for your children that they have the one god needs them to have your life is a journey but you don't ever ever have to be in a pit never and even if your children end up by running with the enemy they're up and out of home running for the enemy just let them know i love you i'm running after jesus but he will get you and they see you not messed up or upset or torn apart because jesus the joy of the lord is your you can be strong all the time you couldn't go after them anyway that would be havoc then you would be torn apart and then they would isolate you okay they got to live their life and make the choices you stand in that gap i believe and declare my child will know jesus christ become a witness for him and we'll be together in eternity and i'm running after jesus and eventually one day they'll come to you and say i need help if they want to come back home you better have a list of guidelines already prepared don't let hell in your home because you're trying to help your kids i'm serious that that would be the enemy's plan if you're willing to follow the guidelines i don't care if they're 40 or 30. it is your realm you create a habitation for heaven and god will make sure you know they don't die in the ditch somewhere but they have to learn they can't use you or take advantage of you because you love them this is truth i want you to have a glorious life and you have authority over all that junk but the glory of god is something he does talk about us having and we carry it and we release it and everywhere we go it will so impact it's like taking bazookas into an area where the enemy is trying to control and they just shoot it really shoots into those demons and it terrifies them it will begin to cover people like a cloud whole area sometimes whole cities will be covered with the glory you carry somewhere it's coming from you so when i got back to the room the other night i was still being consumed by this power of god that was he was here trust me he was here and he spoke last night and i was thanking him for letting me experience all that he says i need to let you know that glory was coming from you that wasn't mine that was coming from you that's what you already carry then i got undone we're entering into powerful days it's not about your age or where you came from what profession you have it is about your relationship with jesus christ and in heaven everyone in heaven is in love with him everybody they still love their family here but he is they're number one he is so it is is a profound thing and a high honor to carry parts of them the fire and the glory it all comes from them all of it say all that can't come from your physical being is something that has to do with your spirit man inside of you and that your soul has agreed to give god permission to do whatever he wants to with you and then when he says something do it right the more you do it the more he gives you that's like a job if you work well well in the past it used to mean that if you got a job you worked hard work well we're honest and hard you got promoted above everybody else some companies are still like that but it's always that way with god he doesn't love one person more than the other but some he can use more than the other don't let jealousy consume you don't covet somebody else's anointing you have your own remember first john 2 27 the more you release the anointing you know what the anointing looks like it looks like a blue fire it looks like blue fire we're going to stir up the anointing today and i'm going to release the glory on y'all but america's greatest call it has is to be a country known because it belongs to god and the glory of god will cover this land it will create regions of light those who refuse it will have regions of darkness until jesus comes all the darkness isn't going to just evaporate off the earth but there'll be seasons where it's pushed back and crushed back until it will have to have a region of darkness to operate in these are powerful times people who live in the regions of glory you'll get to choose there won't be an in between he's erasing the great area that says there is no god even in what he's doing right now to this whole election thing he's exposing the souls of men as a man think is in his soul or his heart so is he so why are these people hating wanting to kill wanting to control and you know they're doing that but i think they're dictators over states or cities not even realizing in their own head i have no way to be reelected that's right if i'm crushing the life out of the people i'm supposed to be leading and watching over why would they want that again they're moving to states where they don't have control because they're tired of it these aren't even people who are christians they're just good moral people i call them the moral majority who want life who actually do care about the life of the unborn they may not know jesus but they have a life they have a family they want a future that's the majority along with the believers who will vote trump in because they've already they've seen his witness and testimony is he's already been doing that and so the enemy satan is so terrified because he's planning to take over our country and make it his own and that's not going to happen it isn't i don't care what the news says they don't know how to do anything but lie even the polls i give are like almost insane the polls biden's uh 80 ahead and i went where are the people voting for and who would that be the ones he bought or the ballots they stole no even god says they're stealing even he tells me they're stealing ballots and then they're going to harvest them and thumb and dump dumpsters and i'm going to expose it i mean the enemy is doing whatever he pays off people to vote more than once and states that you could do that i mean they're they're really doing that they are corrupt and they may have been nice loving people one point but when you give yourself to the darkness it will consume you to a point where you're blinded and you don't even know that you just know that you really they really really believe they're going to win because of the news the fake news lying they watch it they believe the lie this is true hillary fainted when she found out she didn't win she knew even though she had no people it's the truth she wouldn't even appear she fainted people had to get psychiatric help because they were convinced in their soul by the lies they believed a lie so when they didn't win they fell apart they sincerely needed psychiatric help and all these years have gone by they're still getting fed with the same lies or more lies they're so so corrupted they even treat their families different some families have been separated business partners businesses have churches have separated my head can't wrap around how can a pastor say to vote for the other side when they want to kill babies oh it is i'm going to always give you the truth this is the truth you cannot side with the darkness and i personally know people sweetest people you ever knew are so filled with hate they hate hate hate trump i can't say his name i can't bring one thing about him and i'm like what happened to you they watch the fake news and and this is the thing they're not just watching it they're believing it the more you believe it is real even on the wrong side the more real it becomes and that's what's wrong with those people believers you cannot choose death you're surrendering authority over the enemy you do when you choose what the enemy wants you watering down your authority you can't you can't choose it's okay to kill you have given authority by christ but you walk in the light remember that walk in the spirit walk in the light follow after him we know what he thinks about it we know what the father thinks about it he's sending these little babies and then the point of time he needs them on the earth satan has a plan this is his plan if i can kill them remember when he killed him first time in egypt remember that he didn't want moses to deliver a person to be mourned so what did he do he killed babies right then the whole abortion thing started because he doesn't want somebody to be born who will have a voice that will speak the truth and the life and the power of god to people so he'll just wipe out as many as he can so that's why that's the truth about why abortion started that was satan's plan just don't let him live don't let him laugh his new thing he's using is homosexuality do you know why that all came up not just to steal people's destinies no babies born this is absolute truth from god he wants to stop god's plans for the people he made so whatever he can bring a lie if you can get people to believe a lie this is really who you are you're not this person you know this your other person well guess what two guys can't have a baby and do women get a baby so the bottom line is he doesn't want him born that's why it's going to be great when abortion is outlawed i've seen the place in heaven where all these little babies are kept and loved and nurtured and if they have family members there they will eventually get these little babies and they get to raise them if their parents make it if their parents were involved in that repent and get born again they get that little baby back that's how good god is that's how good god is so when you see the big or you're getting a big picture how important it is for us to live our life for him not just once a week you go to sleep living for him you wake up living for him running your race powerfully taken power and authority over the enemy wherever there is destruction wherever there is evil you can send the army to pull down strongholds shred platforms because all of the evil on the earth is still is still controlled by satan he finds people who are willing to do it people who don't even know there is a god you know and some other countries is far worse than is here far worse you know evil is or the power of evil unless you go to some of those third world countries america is one of the greatest countries in the world because we're founded by christian principles god is on our papers that's what he says to me all the time one nation under god is one of the lines satan hates the most he don't want him he doesn't want him involved anywhere in our lives or in this country but he isn't going to stop it so we will be a living example here the body of christ in this country of who god is and that he is he does live that christ lives that we have authority over things they're going to see things people will begin to run after christians to be their friend in the in the months and years ahead because they see things happening to them but they realize they're prospering these years of prosperity and in increase of in every way of revelation with the ideas and inventions god's going to give a lot of that to believers so people will have to get get stuff from them so we can't hide we can't run to the hills and hide take vacation but you can't preach this gospel to the bears and raise your children to do the same god is a generational god and children will be powerful in the earth and and there will be a point in this country at least nobody can have abortions it will become [Applause] illegal so god has his timeline and he knows who inside him he's already picked up generations and said you be this you'll be the aunt you'll be the uncle and you'll be in this generation 20 years later this one will be born and will carry this on and carry on generational lines or call on generations and so this is why it's important when he sends them they get to stay amen there is something that happens every now and then because he's god if he sends one and his life gets ended quickly he will take the whole spirit back and rescind it that's probably the first time you've heard that because he has to have that person on the earth he has to have it he even had me share somebody with that that they had a baby uh it was a little a little well i think they they thought it was why they weren't sure and god told me his name and called them and said uh he said he was struggling so he took him but he's going to send him back say he's god they came from him and he does what he needs to whether you miscarried or a baby was aborted um way back in the day when all that stuff kind of started most of the time the young people weren't involved in that it was pressure from the parents that you can't live your life with a baby hanging on whatever the babies the second i will tell you what their their guardian angel which is sent at conception will take them home to heaven and the second of course the little baby spirit leaves the baby body they're not experiencing pain or suffering or anything and they meet personally with jesus when they're taken up to heaven he's got a special place he meets all of these little babies and they actually receive him as their savior even in heaven they don't need to to stay there but they want to they want to and so their love from the moment they're there he has special places for them to play made just even for little babies this big i've seen an angel in the nursery holding five little babies it's going to be in my book three and then from different different ethnic groups and they were just playing in this angel's hand it was precious and he's made this play pond they ride on turtles they can swim under water breathe water they have picnics with jesus they get put in the pockets of the kangaroos and they hop them around take them for rides the nurseries are not don't look like a clinic they're huge nurseries it looks like beehives and the angels fly in and out they have flowers growing all around these beautiful little gorgeous like mother-of-pearl seashells with beautiful blankets in it and the baby's name is over it and the angels who work in these nurseries will hold these babies they sing the breath of god on them nourishes their little baby spirit and then they huh please name your baby that's most important because the angels give them a nickname when they arrive and that nickname is over have been to the nursery several times and uh when the parent decides to name the baby even if somebody wasn't married if the mother can pick a name for that baby pick one that could be either or you know like sydney could be a boy or a girl something like that pick a name because this is what happens the father sends for the baby i get i get over my own he'll send that little baby and he'll say i have a gift your parent just named you so no longer are you going to be called by your nickname this is your name and they have a big party in heaven for this little baby they actually have a cake for it and everything and they celebrate because their parents recognize they were there and that they would be given back people bring little gifts to that baby and and they change the name over the little thing when a grandparent a great grandparent gets home they get that baby they go get the baby they help to play with the baby raise the baby it grows so slowly it could be 50 years later and your baby would still be a baby god is beautiful and he loves his babies that's why he said it would be worse than having a millstone i wouldn't want to be any of the democrats right now it'd be better for a millstone you know how big they are about the size of that world maybe bigger that map a millstone that they would grind things with and it'd be better for you to have one tied around your neck and thrown into the sea than the punishment you will get for doing that i think he doesn't like it and i tell people but because god has a heart of love if you repent for that if you repent for doing that and give yourself to jesus from that moment your baby will be excited they know you got born again they know you're coming to heaven that's all they can talk about as they will be with their family again so yay jesus so i have to say like god would say every life matters no matter what the color of your skin is we came from the same god and he loves all of us and he has plans for all of us in heaven we're a family there's no baptist street you know people always want to put religion on something there's no pentecostal street there's no you know i can't think of the denominations there's no baptist assembly of god there's there's not your mansion is made for you by the way when you come home you come home as a son or daughter you're not coming home as i was their wife you know each other like best friends but you come home as the father's son or daughter so don't worry if you're married three times we're all in heaven you'll have three friends nobody owns anybody and the father did explain this to me i love him because he just opens up revelation to me to share with people there's a reason why you can't be still married when you go to heaven till death do you part because from that moment you're just his son or daughter you don't stop loving the people on the earth but jesus is our number one there's only one bridegroom in heaven and the father said this is why i had to say once you die you come home to heaven not married in heaven you are not married like on the earth on the earth the angels are not married either they're not that's probably a plus for them they're most of them now i know some of them actually wanted to have all spring that way that was a wildest thing to me why would they want to but in heaven the angels are pretty glad they don't have to get married because they watch us but god sends them on assignments i i need a tissue um he sends them on assignments with somebody who's the opposite personality if you've ever been around a comedian you are a very focused thank you once good enough if you're a focused serious person the last thing you want to be with is a comedian you're being sent on assignment right you're here to rescue this person from whatever whatever whatever stop the enemy's attacks on them and this the one angel i just want to wipe them all out let's just wipe them out get rid of them they're done they don't deserve anything and here's the comedian but won't it be fun uh maybe we'll make some new connections while we're down there maybe some make some new friends maybe go have some angel food together somewhere and this other one is tipped off now they don't sin but i mean he is annoyed because this one is rubbing him the wrong way which is the way he doesn't want to go like we do his husband and wife and this could be a long assignment and god's out there saying you just better get along and every now and then they'll send a courier down there you're being watched and notes are being made and you have to realize too these are real beings they have personalities they have assignments they like certain things they have comedians the two that help me write books one is that holy fierce one the other one's a comedian and they do steal rubbish all the fun silly things in the book where stuff the information was given to me by the fun angel the one about hellfire and all the other stuff was given god sent me two scribe angels they came from gabriel and i have my own angel he's 40 foot tall he's behind me last night make sure i don't fall over when you have the life of a seer it's different you see operations on both sides and you can share with people truth that can help them be free but if you're in the flesh you know what happens right to be spiritually minded is life to be fleshy minded is death that doesn't mean god doesn't love you it just means he can't use you a lot if you're always getting in the flesh which growing up all the body knew was to be in the flesh unless you had a move of god that he changed while the move was there moves of god in this time will actually begin to create a habitation that's god inhabiting your whole life so these are profound days serious days but exciting days for us he has really got your life in his hand if you belong to him but don't leave him out of everything make room for a christ in your life every day and i have conversations with him all the time the holy spirit is my teacher who tweaks me a lot and the father just loves me and gives me revelation i wish everybody could experience that it's like life in heaven it's like life in heaven it is it's just like that if you want to be with the father he'll make himself available in heaven to be with you he has this beautiful place he took me two one time i'm like eight years old and he'll say where would you like to go i can take you to the past i can take you to the future and i said i just want to be with you this was my answer from my own soul and he said well you know i can show you powerful things that happen the great days of the great revivals and you want to go see the welsh you want to go visit the welsh revival you want you want to go see this was created on the earth you want to go see time when it was made and i just want to be with you and the third time he said are you sure you don't want to go back and see when you were a little tiny thing in me you don't want to see when i cast lucifer out of heaven because he knows i'm fierce against the enemy i am right where i want to be and that's what he wanted to hear he said well that is what i wanted to hear you say and so then he put his arms around me he can be as big as he wants big enough that the world is a speck of dust in his hand or small enough to step inside himself and play with all the little spirits that's who he is so i've gotten to a place in my life whatever he wants or needs i'm doing it because nothing is worth missing blessing him i've learned the joy of obedience obedience isn't like a heart thing anymore it's a joy to obey because it blesses him when i love people when i share truth when i share revelation i didn't even really like the pink hair but i let them do it so i couldn't hide and these days a lot of people won't be able to hide anymore it'll be too apparent with the glory coming out of you or the fire on your head the fire on your homes people falling out when they pass in front of your house because of the life of god you have there it's because of him you're going to be different not normal not normal and america was designed by god to be a light in this world for his son to come and send two-thirds of the gospel around the world more people give to the gospel from this country than any other nation in the world more people are sent from here to any other nation to the world because of god that's his plan he calls america his gift his son is the greatest gift but he still says america is my gift to the world i'm not giving it to anyone else [Applause] so no matter what this is the thing you need to understand no matter what they say on election day if it's not what you expected just wait and see what happens i never go by what man says i go what god's plans are and he is taking america back amen he's taking it back and from america this world will begin to be changed and show other countries leaders this is the way you run your country justice liberty freedom and righteousness and he will have open doors to some of these leaders that didn't know they could do anything but war and the darkness would be being to be stripped away because of our authority we can't kill satan we can't kill demons but by our living our life and releasing the glory carrying it sharing the truth about the gospel of the kingdom and running after what god wants in our lives there's no way they can escape not knowing something's going on here and then we'll come to america to find jesus christ amen so we all have a commission and even those who don't want him he's gonna get some really stuff hot stuff going right there will be great harvest in this country and great harvest around the world but until he's ready it will not be the end okay so we focus on what we're doing right now what he wants right now and needs right now pray for all those people who've been feeding themselves with lies when trump wins it won't be good for them we'll rejoice and have a party but many people will think their life has ended because of the lies that were told to them and so we're going to break all that garbage let's just stand up and declare together something we'll pray for him right now i do know that eventually i'm not sure when but some of the networks will be taken from them they'll just be taken from them and given to those who will share the truth or who will be at least unbiased i mean the news is always i remember the day when you actually watched the news and it was real news and it's consumed on with hate because the enemy is running it right so he's going to get unseated so right now we all want to declare and pray on election day especially well we're going to thank god for everyone voting because you have to vote don't forget to vote right encourage people to vote uh but we're going to pray for all those on the luck today who have been filling themselves with lies that the enemy would not talk them into taking their life because god did tell me some people would take their life because they're so their layers are so consumed with all of that this is the only life we can have we will not have a life and they'll believe it so we're all going to take authority i'll just lead you into something to declare and then i'm going to release the glory into y'all are you ready for that jesus christ our lord and savior our beloved who saved our soul we honor your holy name we recognize your life that you gave for us we look forward this day and the future to ruin reign with you that is your desire so right now we corporately stand in the gap for those who've believed a lie and who hate without without measure we pray for their souls they will not be consumed with grief when trump wins on november the third we pray god the holy spirit will go to those voting booths and into the homes later to speak to the soul of those people to not take their life that there's still hope for them and we take power over all the power of the enemy has been controlling these lies and these people to bring deception we command the army of heaven to go right now and on election day do you make sweeps around this country depart on every stronghold of satan that is controlling them to shred every platform of high-level spheres of wickedness that would like to take their lives we say in the name of the lord we will not tolerate those actions we will not tolerate the enemy ruining people's destinies we say no more will you control this country or run this country or steal people's destinies this is a time of celebration and greatness and we declare those people who believe the lie will not miss their destiny they will become believers in jesus christ and great witnesses to his salvation so be it in jesus name [Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] oh sit down for just a minute [Music] there's many ways we can do do this importations and there's one of the ways i do it quite often when we have a quite a bit of people i have everybody hold hands it's going to be okay you won't get sick we evict any of that we won't tolerate any sickness in this no we don't tolerate the virus anymore either right we kick it out and evict it from this place only each row not all the way across okay only like this row hold hands just this row i'm gonna come by i'm gonna come by and i'm gonna grab the hand of the person and literally it will flow through every person [Music] i want you to picture i want you to picture this really happens i've done a congregation with 3 000 people like this and you're already sitting so if you have to fall at least it's backwards the glory is the power and presence of the living god it comes in a form of a cloud like light the glory is always talked about as the light or a cloud remember the cloud by day the fire by night they both belong to him they do different things inside of us baptism and fire will burn the whole world off the walls of your soul like it was never there things you things you saw things that bothered you that's what the fire does i've had a measure it came in and hit me so hard when the pastor ladies and i was thrown back into the congregation with a usher a seven foot usher thrown and my body laid on the floor and it shook that's fire okay and and the first time ever angels came and took me back in time my body was there they locked me in with a security guard stuck a note in my sleeve when she wakes up my dad will come and get her call this number i was taken back to the tomb of christ right after the stone had been rolled away i was there at that time if he takes you the time you're there it's not a vision it's not a dream and i have a lot of revelation about his resurrection what that looked like what went on it was really powerful and then he brought me back and all i could do was speak in tongues for two weeks and i had open visions of the fire hitting cities whole cities and congregations is something you don't have to ask people did you get baptism and fire the glory is something that builds in you the more you know him spend time with him obey him this glory he let you carry it for him and let me tell you people will be seeking that out it can sometimes be visibly seen on moses the glory was seen on his face remember that because he was what with god when you spend time with him that glory begins to build in you and it even says at one point the night will be light around us in other words it won't come upon you if you go outside you are the light walking around like people can't escape that what is that light on you what is that you get to share all about jesus and the glory right and then when you get into loose and waves it begins to it will totally wipe out anything of the darkness around people in buildings and that that glory cloud it's a cloud i saw a sole cloud last night just ruling around me the whole time and uh and sometimes you can hear it it's like a shock wave you can hear it and i'm like the first time it happened i'm like wow that person is really anointed i was walking past at the product's table and the holy spirit was just laughing he said go just start walking along the line and where they went they went and i said well this were those people anointed he goes that was coming from you will let you experience releasing the glory and when you take it around the world that's what happens to cities this is for the body of christ so you're going to get a measure of that glory we do it by laying on our hands if i feel like it's not enough i'm just going to mind touch it i might run over top of the rose i don't know what i'll do a greater work is walking on air i've done that you feel nothing but you're walking on it christ walked on water he felt the water walking on years of greater work that awesome this is for us this is who we are it's because of who we belong to who we give ourselves to we have not just promises but we have rights as believers to walk in all of that so i'm just going to start somewhere over here and i will just grab the hand and i'll feel it leaving me i'll feel that leaving me and it just goes down the row i'll go to the next one and you just need to say i'll receive it okay so get ready the ones on the end you're going to be last there's something about being last so y'all ready so we'll go down this road so father right now i just release [Music] the glory of god i'll probably get very i release the glory of god just say i receive it if sometime tonight you can't walk right that's it father i just impart and release [Music] the glory

and the children some of you have lost children in their young and some of you have lost babies and and although just isn't it heaven every time she shares that story and she even she enhanced it all the things uh just just really powerful i trust it touch your heart for some of you that have been really burdened over those children um the babies the children that um have been abused so the lord's lord's taken care of taking care of his children um thank you lord this is uh this is a very um it's a very powerful time we always love it when cat comes i was talking to pastor brooke last night and he says you know we got to have her come here twice a year at least you guys okay with that if she could come very good very good she could come yeah jen come on you got some oh mama come here for a second come on come on mama come here and we want to make sure you yeah come on come on up here we'll make sure we we'll make sure that we get jen you come on up look at these shoes man oh look at them babies camera camera yeah look at those hey that's awesome hey um is there anything you want to say mama yeah we we are just always so blessed to have you here dear and anything you want to tell on cat or you know when she's a kid you know you know we knew she was perfect but anything else you want to you want to say um yes first i want to tell you you've been my church for a whole year now faithfully and i can't wait for sunday to come i just didn't know you were on more than sunday or i've been watching them but i've seen so many of you on the camera and i thought these people are my family and so but but i want to speak now too just for just a few minutes i'll try to make it quick because i'm not i'm really not you're doing good so far i'm not get up here but from the time i was a little girl all i ever wanted to be was a wife little mother and i didn't know the lord in my heart but i talked to him and i told him all i want to be is a mother and a wife and that's all i ever wanted to be so when i got married well i went to church with my grandmother i was raised catholic but i went to church from my grandmother to her old-time methodist church and i got to hear hymns in english so the one that stuck with me was in the garden and i don't know whether any of you even know that old but i i was little and i sat there and i heard them sing he walks with me and he talks with me and i never said anything to my grandma but i thought can you really do that and amazingly even though i went to a catholic school and always went to church in the confession none of it stuck with me not one bit of it it just didn't stick so when i met my husband who was a spirit-filled pentecostal [Music] and i just saw something in him that i knew i had never felt before and an assembly god pastor married us and i wasn't saved but i did he talked with me and i told him my children will be raised in church my husband's church and i will go with him so he went ahead and married us but as i in the first year i had my first baby she was two months early she only weighed four pounds a little bitty thing and i started praying over my babies i prayed over them while i carried them and i talked to the lord and i said all i ever want lord for my children is that they serve you with their whole hearts and i don't care where you call them to go out back the prayer and as they little older when they grow up i gave them back to the lord i said their daddy and i have raised them to know you now they're your your job where you want to send them and i've never held back on one of them and where they want to go so don't ever ever give up on their children if you haven't had children yet start praying for them before you even get them and don't ever back down because i've gone through things with some of my kids and i just always said lord they're yours they're yours they're yours they're yours sometimes you have to give tough love don't back down from that either it may hurt but in the long run you those that you love you chastise that's right it's good so i want to know you to know how much i love all of you and your your praise and everything else you just bless me thank you lord hey mama i want you to do one thing if you have uh and even if you're at home and you have kids that are wayward and uh and they're not serving the lord i want you to stand up we're gonna have mama we'll have mama pray for them and then if you're home well you can buy any of the medias just stand up right there in your home get out of that lazy boy just stand up there very good okay mama pray for him father i'm going to tell them like you told me when i had my wiggler son wandering in the wilderness and you said don't worry i haven't been on my hand and when the time is ripe i'm just going to close that hand and he'll be back where he belongs so don't worry that's one thing that can hinder your prayers that's good don't worry you don't you don't worry if you trust the lord you trust him with your whole heart and no matter how bad it looks you just remind him lord i love you first i love them second but i know you love them more so i'm just trusting you to bring them around very good so be it that's good yeah they're yours lord they're yours lord you do whatever you want they just you just came on loan to me thank you mama thank you that was really awesome thank you lord

how important it is for us to be here right now and to have revelation to live by i know we live in this world but we are not of this world we are hovanians first how many people believe life in heaven is better than anywhere else [Music] and everyone who lives there thinks so and i know people picture you know a handful in heaven and a multitude in hell but you're wrong there's millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of people who live in heaven that really got jesus some of it was on their deathbed but they got him some of them you'd be surprised who made it when you get there sometimes i was surprised [Laughter] but i'm here to uh god calls me a revelator if you wonder where that started it wasn't from me most of the things i share are not from me i have to say them because he asked me to say them but i'm a revelator i reveal things and john in the book of john in revelation he also was a revelator and i've had people say the craziest things to me well why do you say that that's not anywhere in the bible there's nothing about revelation in the bible apparently you have not read the last chapter that's not a title or something that's actually something that happened it is a thing it's revelation from the father not from man and if it was important enough to put in the word of god then it's important enough to still share it today and i know i get a lot of revelation i got new stuff today i got brand new stuff today just sitting in the hotel room and jen said one thing to me and a portal open and revelation on what she asked me pour down from heaven um that's not the first time it happened but not not as much as i got it didn't stop it was still going and i finally had to uh stop and go out the hallway of where we were eating in the hotel and just record what he had told me so fonda was so much and one of the things he did talk to me about today was kavanaugh yeah he talked to me about kavanaugh and the supreme court and justice for america and so i will be talking about this wearing my my red word white and blue here and even my boots see they're red white and blue you have me get those i i got these from jones boot company in missouri yes i think they're the second or third largest in america and i know by mentioning their name to give a lot of money to the gospel and i think it's third generation now a very good friend of ours um and a friend of mine daughter and her husband my son-in-law they're very close friends and he recently took over he's young he really recently took over the hogue company they started as a yarn distributor not yarn but twine uh and the holes were said no they didn't sell yarn to bail the hay with i don't know a lot about bailing hay but i know you need more than yarn to tie it all together and they started you know doing that and they're known all over the world really they sell that but then they went into the boot industry and when i do go they sell to me like one-third the price so i have a lot of boots and every time i go there to minister they get me more boots but i wasn't there this last time uh god said why don't you get those with the red white and blue on we like those and i've worn them a lot especially if we're going to talk about america uh heaven wants me to wear red white and blue and i think today they're all wearing red white and blue in heaven if you if you think they're disconnected from the things going on this earth you don't know them they're very much involved in what we are doing because they're all declaring over the destinies of all of us who are here right now those who finished the race and they moved to heaven by the way they didn't get lost you don't need to tell people i lost my father i lost them no they moved that's right you know my father moved to heaven that's the greatest place you couldn't even find it on this earth having more fun than they ever had in their life they're existing to live yeah you know down here a lot of times we feel like we live just to exist okay people some don't understand that i do not believe that you your whole body sleeps when it dies your soul never sleeps not now and your spirit man never sleeps either there's both spiritual things they're wait 24 hours a day and let me tell you they'd be bored in a casket if you went right now and laid in the casket and shot that lid that's what it would be like if all of you stayed there but that's not what happens it's not what the bible says it says to be absent from the body that means something moved out of there right yes it moved out because this is just like a covering this is just a little thing that you know holds all the stuff together inside and uh and right now it's temporary because when you get it back one day it will be glorified it will be supernaturally glorified one day and everyone who lives in heaven knows that's going to happen to them one day and it's going to be fantastic but we have a mission and a commission right now on this earth to do things never done before we are a supernatural people a supernatural generation living on this earth that was made by the god that we love and that we serve and they're all excited up there about this country now i will assure you he loves the world the world and the fullness thereof belongs to the lord it does and he is also very interested in what's going on he still comes down here a lot he appears to a lot of people get messages to people he actually does it to me a lot also so it's not like he moved up there and just stayed there forever he does go back and forth a lot he does come in himself and say things to people he's appearing to the jihad so how about that's that's that that is the the i guess the most i don't know how to speak to introduce them to you but they're not normal muslims i'll just tell you that uh the jihad many of them are interested in wiping out a lot of stuff on the earth they don't know god they don't know jesus christ but he is in person coming to them and there are a lot of them getting saved it's part of shifting nations right now and so nothing is going to seem to be impossible and even what happened in the supreme court a lot of people would say that was never going to happen i knew it was going to happen because i do know god's plans for this country and i'm telling you it's going to be fantastic to live here and at the end of 24 years it will not even look like or sound like like the same country it will be beyond better than it was [Applause] everywhere in this nation in the most unexpected places and i'm telling you he's coming to consume us in this nation he's going to make an example for other nations to follow if they want god amen that's the pattern if they want god and they want success they want employment for their people if they want their people to be free to be safe to be prosperous then god's going to make our country an example of that because of him amen and so we've been very much involved in the last elections and i'm excited about november i'm excited about the midterm elections it's going to be just like it was before it's going to turn the map red and i know uh if you watch the fake news and let me tell you this people if they were smarter they wouldn't be beating everyone up and accusing them wrongly you know they they don't even know what they're doing in today's society with the internet with twitter you know with the podcast however we are we're available everywhere 24 hours a day you can talk to people you know on this online everything everybody posted but you can't hide it anymore and that's really a good thing because god can't be hidden anymore and the righteous things can't be hidden and justice and freedom cannot be hidden what's being done right can no longer be hidden by the other side that doesn't want anything good really i'm sorry for them sometimes that they they can't see what they're doing or saying they're hurting their self and they and what their plan is would hurt generations even more than what we have been affected already and so that's why god put someone in the white house who knew what to do in the situation who wouldn't back down wouldn't be bought you know couldn't be used couldn't could not you can't put fear in him and i tell people tonight don't waste your time anymore you're not going to impeach him not ever he will be there for eight years whether anybody likes it or not well heaven likes it and i remember when god said from the time he takes the the seat in the white house america will not have one boring day and we haven't have it and you know god did anoint him to influence because the influence he has is for good yes it is for good he gives a space for god whether you know it or not he does know him he's still new in that but he does he as we see jesus christ as the savior i'm talking about our president and he's very focused on not letting god be shut out of our country and that alone is just that the blessings that come upon our country just because he recognizes there is a god and this country belongs to god and i don't know how many times he's already said god bless america god bless the people and i still think one of the most famous things he said and his acceptance speak to us i'm here to give your country back to you and i don't remember any other president ever saying i'm here to give your country back to you because you know i don't think a lot of people remember it's for the people by the people yes is that right yeah and so we do have a lot of say i've never in my life gotten so many texts and surveys never in my life from you know you think this solicitor at your door you know or all these other people calling you on the phone to take uh you know asking to do surveys uh our president has asked me for more than any other company i know in america has a has sent me a surveys on my phone all the time and emailed it to me and texted it to me and if you're giving me your number you're going to get text i'll tell you that about everything and so he definitely is what god said he was that he's an all-american boy who was all for america and i won't ever stop talking about it because god won't let me stop talking about him he said my voice is going to be heard of what i think what i plan and what is actually going to happen yes and don't listen to what anyone else says because i have the final word that's my that's my my boy this that i put in the white house and he said i made him a certain way and he was out of all of the people in the land right now anywhere in this country he was my choice amen he said i will back it up and the people will love him even though some may not like that they'll still benefit from it and there's already been like two million jobs created amen and our borders are safer they're going to get safer and i can tell you that part of the other side wants no borders whatsoever that's not wise everybody say that's not wise i don't want that do you want that no i don't either because it it protects us right right we're not a mean hateful special country you can come in legally yeah we don't say you can't come you come illegally so we know who is criminals and who are not criminals who are terrorists who are not terrorists because there wouldn't be much of a country left amen so we have some really good solid plans uh that would be god and and our government right now has some really good solid plans for this country and i'm really excited about it uh the prosperity the joy the celebration uh the holidays being brought back i will be celebrating christmas in a big way we make a birthday cake for jesus we've always done that when i was growing up we had a birthday cake for jesus he likes some honey in it by the way but he does love sweets and if you have a sweet tooth blanket on him or joint heirs with christ remember that who would have ever thought one thing i have found out in my many encounters that i have in heaven with god i mean before it was always jesus who would walk through the walls of my home and he'd have me sit down and he would say things to me like face to face like i'm looking at you and uh i had not ever got accustomed to that and still get undone but when the father comes you know uh they have the same heart they have that same holiness in them but when the father comes himself it does something to the inside of me that my dad my my permanently always daddy where i lived and who who took care of me and held me and it says in the bible that he was called you know he's called the mini-breasted when i'm talking about the father he carried us inside of him like a mother carries the babies in the womb and i love the little things he would tell me that he would tell to a little child anywhere he said you know i put water in the womb of the mother so it'd be something that would be familiar to that baby because when you lived in me you played in the river of life inside of me i never thought of that not ever in a million years would i have ever and yeah i knew that i mean i knew that there was water it protects the baby it keeps the float you know there's all reasons why we have and i have birth three children so i understand all that and uh but i never considered the fact even knowing the river of life was inside the father and it flows out of him it's never ending you can't see where it comes from at all but it's it's never ending and we would play inside we would swim we'd swim under the water run on top of the water jump on the stones of fire he has this massive mountain the highest line i've ever seen was inside him and we would run and slide down that mountain from the water flowing in it then we would jump on the stones of fire and we played we played like little children we played we didn't have to decide what we were going to eat where we were going to live you know what we were going to do and then we could move out we would jump on the rays of the rainbow to come from inside them they would jump on and we would ride in and out on those rays of the rainbow because in him we lived we moved we had our very existence and so and that's what that talks about in the scripture we came from him everybody came from the same place we all all people whoever were born on this earth lived in him first it said in the bible he knew us before we were born you know he would talk to us he would play with us because we lived in him that's how he could see us that's how he could know us he wrote every day of our life in the book before he sent us how about that and there's other scrolls in heaven that talk about the plans he has for you and sometimes you'll be partnering with the host of heaven or maybe with gabriel's group and helping to bring the body parts down a gabriel's group bring those body parts down a lot of people have prayed them down you know and and really that's necessary for us to do that we have to invite heaven that's why we invite jesus christ yes you need to get jesus without asking him to come in is that true this is some of the most powerful revelation i was ever given when i was in heaven when he caught me up to heaven he said there is a protocol you must invite you have to invite my son for him to come live in you you're going to invite the holy spirit to come and indwell you and he says so when you invite that gives us permission to do something with that invitation you have to invite the host of heaven to be one of your personal weapons that will war against the enemy and pull down the strongholds around you put on strongholds of darkness and uh so there's new revelation that plan of god that we will actually help complete the destiny of the armies of heaven he's already always had that plan while we lived in him we weren't even here the earth wasn't even here he made plans for that because see the the armies of heaven can't just go attack wherever they want to they're an army our army well unless trump's over yeah anyway most armies just can't go attack what they feel like well this is basically we're going to take our own weapons without any orders from headquarters we're just going to go attack wherever we want to that would not make sense down here are the military no matter what military or what country they all pretty much have the same way they handle that they have officers over them but first they train them is that right they get trained and i tell people all the time this is a good way to explain it to you you want to be an airline pilot you go apply with delta or american airlines you're not going to walk in the next day and get your license i wouldn't fly on that plane our lives as believers it's the same thing but the angels in heaven it is the same way they have a protocol of how they operate in heaven the government of heaven the army of heaven and gabriel's all the watcher angels and the healing angels and the body parts angels worker angels scribes i can i can make a whole long list that are under gabriel one of the guardian one of the um my mind's going now uh one of the archangels thank you holy spirit um the archangels are fantastic they have a higher level of understanding of knowledge inside of them because they're over like whole groups of angels and the hosts actually prefer to be called the host when it says a great host in the bible that's the army okay it talks about angels and leaders of angels that's usually gabriel's group and gabriel's work look beautiful most all of gabriel's the angels under him look like us you probably couldn't tell sometimes if it was an angel or not they can hide their wings many times i have i don't have arguments but people try to argue with me that angels don't have wings because i've seen them and they don't have any and so you didn't see all of them okay you didn't see all of the all almost every angel i've ever known or seen which is probably billions of angels at this point they all have wings some are made out of energy some are made out of color some are made of light you know we always think they have to have feathers you know like a bird and if they don't have them they don't have them but they're probably invisible some can have them when they need them and not have them i have news for you the father has wings so there's jesus he came with healing in his he does he doesn't always show them he does have wings mighty wings the father has powerful mighty wings you know about psalms 91 right he has wings holy spirit has wings the holy spirit is huge he's really tall i have never seen him he's invisible but he does have an appearance it's the best way to describe him i used to ask god how do i describe him he lives in me i hope he lives in you holy spirit lives in me he's my best friend yes and i thank him all the time the most simplest things i need or i can't find or i don't know he'll show me bring it to me or tell me without me even asking and so he talks to me 24 hours a day gets on to me a lot that's what best friends do right yes and he's also god i don't know why people want to put him in a different category he's god he can be worshipped he can be praised and so he's part of the trinity they're all holy they're all the godhead and they are uh even though their parents may differ a little bit their heart is the same they are for us they are not against us they have more hope for us than anyone else in existence and so uh they're fantastic to to get to know i want everyone here to know them you know in a in a really awesome way and but their goal always is for us to be greater to be more prosperous to have their heart to have their understanding to know their ways to want their will it's really important to have those things if you're going to be successful in this world and when you get to that place the devil will be terrified of you he's already afraid of you he doesn't attack you because he's angry he attacks because he is very afraid he's afraid you'll become you will become more and more like them amen he really is he doesn't want you to have revelation he doesn't want you to know how to be greater he doesn't want you the devil doesn't want you to know how to go in the spirit realm and or execute the government of god on this earth or how your soul to prosper especially he's most terrified that he does not want your soul to prosper he doesn't want you to live in divine help he doesn't but that's just too bad because in this time it'll be normal to operate just like that that your soul will continue to prosper every day that it will not be filled with doom and gloom with violence with anger with offense all those things come from the enemy and the less you have them the more terrified hell is of you and the more blessed god is in heaven so in my life i love to bless the lord i love to bless the father and i love to bless the holy spirit i greet them every morning when i wake up that's the first thing i say and then i kiss my husband goodbye so he can go fishing and he goes fishing and spends time with god that's how he spends his time with him i mean if it's 14 15 hours and smell like bait when he comes home not my favorite thing but really you can have as much of them as you want as much as you will choose to pursue them and we get so busy in this world just trying to live sometimes we forget them unless we really need something and it's okay to ask for help and you need help but the whole purpose for us to have the host of heaven the armies of heaven at our personal disposal to use is so you won't be running to them all the time asking them to rescue you to keep you safe because we have that ability because of christ to do that ourself because we're going to a new level we can't live the same place we were before you can't we go from glory to glory that means you're going to a higher level of knowing them a higher level of dominion and authority a higher level of prosperity a higher level of the glory that is an upward movement that means you can't stay here we can't be down here anymore being crushed by the enemy he is under our feet [Applause] i'm gonna make doormats and say hell is our doormat that's the way we need to think if we always walk around filled with fear or confusion or anger then we can't go to those levels so that's why god is sending some of the greatest revelation this is my introduction i'm going to talk about america but this is the holy spirit's introduction i'll just say that the holy spirit always has an introduction because there's always new people who how many people this first time you've ever heard me anybody bless them jesus just take your natural mind and set it on a shelf you'll be fine because i talk about spiritual things now i walk in the spirit amen so i don't walk in the flesh i don't have personal opinions i have their revelation and i live by it i can't tell you these things if i have not lived them myself and it does make a difference but what i'm sharing to you is a lifestyle it's not a cafeteria if you can live on earth like they do in heaven that means you'll have to make some changes in your life you walk in the spirit what does that mean that's a place it's a place by the way new revelation john was in the spirit why did he say that why did that why didn't even get put in the bible why was that in the bible they could have just said he heard and was caught up that's not how it starts he was in the spirit it was the way he lived how he processed god the way he responded to everything he lived a spiritual life that doesn't mean you walk around so you know so serious and sour and that's not even what holy is holy is absent of sin it's an absence of sin that's not hard amen so john lived this way that he would hear the voice of the lord he always obeyed he was always willing to do what he wanted and he kept him on this earth he could still be here if he wanted to but he missed heaven remember he went there you never forget it when he was caught up so he was in that that place in his heart he was in the spirit on the lord's day and when they because they said that i don't think he was even on the isle of patmos that was supposed to be his prison they put him there because they were so afraid of him they couldn't kill him they tried more than three times they tried to kill him all the time it never worked it never worked because this was what god was doing with him he was allowing him to stay here as long as he wanted he would fill him with things all the time so he was already sharing and doing what god had told him and i'm sure what jesus taught him he would go in the spirit in the spirit realm and he would appear before the sanhedrin when he felt like it even after he was sent to the alabamas they didn't want him to talk to people they didn't want him around people he was way too weird they couldn't kill this guy you know what are we going to do we need to put him somewhere so we're safe he couldn't make you know any interruption or disruption which happened every time he would appear somewhere he already had that revelation of going in the spirit and so he was in the spirit on the lord's day and that door open he heard that voice he recognized that voice and then he was taken up and saw heaven saw god the father sitting on the throne with the rainbow around him he saw him [Laughter] and so he was showing him he saw the very person that he would say in the book of john you cannot see the face of god and live and yet in the book of revelation he saw him and saw the face of god and lived because this was about a new relationship when you receive jesus christ you can see the face of god and live you can see it you're not going to be any different when you go to heaven if you have christ in you then you're righteous you have entrance into heaven not just when you die sometimes god will catch people up even even unsaved people just so they can have an encounter and they freak out they come back and then they want to receive jesus christ that's happening a lot too he's not just catching up believers and so you can have an encounter with the living god with jesus christ the holy spirit a lot of us have already had he's definitely strange he loves drama in case you wonder why we have drama when we receive the holy spirit there's a lot of drama i love a story that was told a long time ago i think it was probably back in the 50s 40s and this church was experiencing the holy spirit just moving on everybody but their pianist was the most proper person in the church and she wore white every sunday to show how holy she was and she sit there and play the most common alcohol tunes on her organ and she was never moved or touched and everybody was like falling out there rolling on the floor they were speaking in tongues you know and she thinks i'm just going to remain rapper until one sunday church was passed they all wanted to come and see what was going on and the holy spirit just totally invaded her she jumped off of the off of the bench and did flips she hit the pipe of the wood stove sit like a cloud came over her it covered her white outfit all the way to her feet stuck in her hair it got on her face she went up and down the aisle just yelling in tongues back and forth did not care at all so there was drama in that church that day that's right this is a true story and she never was the same after that she loved everybody she's saying she's singing tongues sometimes you know and so let me tell you you can try to avoid it all you want to but they're going to come a day when the spirit of god would touch all flesh amen without permission in the last days i will pour out my spirit on what and people who never prophesied before never had visions before never dreamed they're going to do it that's right it could be people walking out of walmart get hit by the holy spirit this is the picture you need to have not just everybody sitting in a church and happening it's going to happen in the streets in the restaurants in the grocery store you know the holy spirit's not going to go oh i should wait until they come out now he's the most excited being in all existence right now the greatest show on earth will be when the spirit of god is loose on all [Applause] and people who know flesh a believer they'll all be beating your door down calling you on the phone what just happened to me what happened what happened what happened i can't stop shaking i'm crying i'm laughing i need to know who jesus is i know you know him yes it's going to happen it hasn't happened yet the baptism in fire is going to come right after that that is a separate baptism yes it's the fire that comes from god the father himself it will not be very long away i don't have dates for everything but i can tell you this just because of what's already happening in the world and there's signs that you will see signs that things are changing and it's not going to be the same well the very trump got elected was a sign okay something new is happening god's actually going to do exactly what he wants no matter what the whole world is saying no matter what comes up against him it's just not going to make any difference because you're fighting god and all those democrats were fighting god about kavanaugh because god was on his side he wants change in the justice department so god has a lot of things that that are just starting on the earth for the first time yeah and we get to do that yes he's not just going to do everything himself he wants you to do them now you probably thought your whole life you're going to sit on a seat and go home and have a good sunday dinner and watch football or you know go play with your kids or whatever you do and then i'll go back next sunday your life won't be like that anymore you won't it'll be a lot more exciting it'll be powerful there'll be many things required of you and in order for you to carry the glory the absolute power of the living god yes to when you walk into places things are shifted like hundreds and thousands of people like land where nothing grew before produce will come up you go out and stop the earthquakes and then they can put it back you raise the dead that will cremate it yes these are greater works see all these are things that are mentioned in the bible but i think some pastors forget them because a lot of them are just talking about escaping and that's not what's going to happen that's why the holy spirit told me to make things that said roll up your rapture rug remember the first time you said okay you're going to the church are you going to say tell everybody roll up the raptor rugged one okay roll up your rapture rug he said i didn't tell you to occupy that that's not money man jesus said occupy until i come that doesn't mean go sit somewhere in the woods with the raccoons and the sea rations and it doesn't mean sitting under wraps or rugging your corn or not doing ever doing anything but waiting to get out of this awful place he expects us to change it with the power of god revelation us surrendering our life you know when you get saved when you get born again the light of god is put in you your name is written in this massive book in heaven the book of life the angels always record it when people get born again they're always recording it as evidence they take it to heaven they don't have to but they want to god takes a stone of fire from himself and puts it in your spirit man and that's when you have light that's where the light comes from jesus takes a portion of his anointing a measure of the anointing walking on the earth and he deposits it in you that's in first down 227 if you wonder where that is so you get something you get deposits and things put in you to make you supernatural and then it gives you revelation especially when there's a new time we have new ways we have understanding of our weapons if we have been using them that armor of god he told you to put on it is powerful if you're going into a strange place where you know people use like really bad language or stuff going on before you go in that door you need to lift up my shield of faith it will block and quench every fiery dart of the enemy those are words propane words like people screaming yelling hating it won't penetrate you that's what that shield does all of those parts of your armor are important but when you have revelation they're even more powerful and now he's adding on top of that the the destiny of the army of heaven to operate as our weapon and we command them because god himself said command he me he didn't say tell me what to do what he was saying was you say what is going to happen if we are kings and priests we have authority we have a voice to speak we have a voice to speak into the atmosphere into the spirit realm against any evil no matter where it is we have power over all the power of the enemy he gave us powerful weapons his word is powerful his name the demons hate his name they remember who he was and he wasted hell on the third day and noted the faces of the principalities and powers and they can't change it they can't fix themselves when something happens from a born-again powerful believer filled with jesus christ you are dangerous that and i know you i talk a lot about the authority because the body needs to know they have it yes and i could talk about all the love of god and i did that for years how much you love them he believes your father you know he wants he wants you to know his mercy and his goodness and he does he wants you to be blessed beyond measure and he does but he wants to know the other part of it jesus is a warrior he's a king right now i don't picture him as a little a shepherd holding a little lamb in his arms anymore i see him with those crowns on his head and his flings of fire and that sword that comes unless you divide things asunder i see him that way he is my king he is the king of spiritual kings we are the spiritual kings [Music] so this is a new lifestyle for you what i share with you is not just one little thing that's going to help you or another little thing if you live without revelation it's a lifestyle i mean the host of heaven hearken unto the voice of the lord and he's in us when we speak and give them commands to go do things put on strongholds of darkness crush it push it back they do it because they recognize that voice in us but if you as a believer are playing in sin you may as well put an ego target on you you're going to get tapped that's right you can't go forward in the kingdom that's right and then you step back by playing or partnering with help you're stepping back you see that you're stepping back and you're flashing into the way you were before and you're partnering with the enemy well that means man they were beating me up now i'm coming after them yes that's right someone actually asked a question at our table why do i get attacked a lot i feel like they got a big target on me well i i didn't answer that question but my first thing was how have you been living have you been treating people what have you been saying what's in your layers good because you have to be filled with the light like we we are the kingdom of light we are against the kingdom of darkness so if you get sucked into that kingdom of darkness that means you stepped back and you are not fit for the kingdom is that what that scripture says if you go forward in the kingdom don't step back or you will not be fit for the kingdom it's like an athlete who's practicing for the olympics for like 10 years they've been doing they finally get their time three months away and they decide i'm just going to stop all this i'm tired of practicing i don't want to practice i don't want to do this i'm tired i'm taking a break do you think they would win in the olympics they wouldn't be any use to themselves or their team they would not be fit to compete that's what he means when he says you will not be fit for the kingdom because your level of authority went down when you gave it away to the enemy that's that's not god doing that that's your choice with your will amen so don't step back if you go forward with this you got to keep going forward heaven is a forward motion it's not a back and forth i'm going here and i'm going to go back and i'm going here oh no i got to go back and he'll forgive you for all of it to forgive you always but he can't put you back up here if you were there and you step back either by going into sin or by hating people and bashing and crushing them all the time that's not heaven's words you're not giving life it says choose life or death you're giving death so that means you're stepping back then the place you were in going forward in the light you're making conquest sending the host to put on strongholds mess up the isis they get messed up you can't go forward and and the host will listen to you as long as you're going forward in the light and there's not darkness in you because they can't partner with darkness they were sent by the lord they are a weapon a mighty weapon to the pulling down of strongholds we don't fight the enemy we're already conquerors that as kings and priests and the kingdom we do have an army amen it's the nose no difference in our own military if we had great generals and they were getting all these troops to go forward making conquest taking land taking territory and they decided to go partner with the very enemy they're fighting and they give out secret information and tell for well some of our troops are stuff like that do you think they are going to be any good to this military that they've been taking forward we have to see it that way that we can no longer participate with the enemy and do not let fear rule you that's right that's right one of the reasons why our president is so successful is he does not have fear in him he doesn't have fear he's made major plans everything within his being wants to see those plans happen he really loves his country and he really loves the people and just because people have twisted and lied about but he doesn't care what they're saying he's not wasting his time he's not running back trying to pull out stuff no no no no he is going forward which terrifies the enemy and we should have an example we have jesus christ for example but our very president should be an example to all of us if you want to achieve the destiny and the goal you have in your life you can't let everybody here or here pull you back drag you off the path get you caught into other things you have to stay focused amen and have fun while you're doing it that's right man so today the victory that happened in our country and this is what that victory meant all of heaven is celebrating kavanaugh being put on the supreme court this is why they're celebrating and i'm sitting there god says pouring this all stuff into me and i watched it when they confirmed him and i kept telling people i don't care what they're saying i don't have time to listen to the other side i don't i know that god has positioned this country for greatness for blessings for justice which is written on one of the steps of his very throne the word justice is there this is our season and time for justice especially as believers but also for our country this is a time of justice liberty and freedom and that's what he stood for that's what kavanaugh stood for and so they found someone to pay them to lie with not one shred of evidence no evidence even his own children did not believe the lies about him they lived with him they knew his character they knew that he loved god and god picked him like he put trump and he kept telling me i don't care what they say he is sitting on the supreme court he's going to wipe out rogue versus way he's going to give life to baby and when i'm sitting there today in the hotel room he kept showing me letting me see all these millions of babies who have been aborted and have hearings that are in heaven they sang and celebrated as they were saying yes he was going to sit on the screen this is what they knew that life would change for all the babies in america that no longer illegal to take their lives and wipe them away like dust like they had that and they have forgiven all those people there's no anger in their little souls they're free they forgive everybody the people who performed it the people who allowed it the people who voted for that to be legal they forgave every person but today they had a party in heaven and they celebrated the other babies being conceived in the womb one day we'll never have to fear the life being taken and they'll get to complete their destiny on this earth so there was a big party in heaven today because of that and then and the father began to tell me he said yes we now have there is now god in the white house because he's welcomed and allowed to be there and he said and now i have permission to be in the supreme court because of cavanaugh as a believer being sit on that vent sitting on the bench of the supreme court he said now i have the right to speak into the court system and he said because of that i have assigned three special ops angels see i'll never just tell you something you're going to get details he has a sign of three powerful angels host of the host and they're called their names are justice liberty and freedom and they are assigned to protect and keep kavanaugh on his family and they're also assigned to help him bring justice liberty and freedom to this country in the supreme court and he said he was just the first put in there he said there are more to follow and everyone that's nominated will win the nomination he said because i'm involved in that amen so this is really a time for us to celebrate god's hand moving again divinely moving against all the stuff that was manufactured paid to happen and as much as possible they would spend all their time on the fake news telling the fake stuff and it didn't stop it it didn't stop it from happening god said and again in the midterm elections that map will be turned red amen okay because i did not invest myself in trump and putting him in the office only to have halfway through his term have everything taken away he said that it will not happen so there's some prophecy for you going to be great you just have to watch stop watching jumps and a lot of people do not understand they think the whole end is here we actually had somebody i don't know if they message me or commented i don't know what they did um what the hell they said it to me they said that you are absolutely wrong you need to stop talking about all these good things happening because this is the last day and there is no time for those things to happen i want to say maybe not on your clock or calendar but we're living on god's timeline right now amen and i said i will not ever stop saying these things because they will happen yes amen god's going to make sure his voice stays spoken in this world so you know what's going to happen amen you should hear him that clearly if your heart is to pursue him to have that you're going to have it you can't escape having his voice you can't he's not a respecter of persons we all have the ability to prophesy the bible say all they prophesied does that say that yes so he said desire the best gifts that's a best gift you hear how god's voice and then speak it for him and let me tell you go how do i know he's saying something you feel like you're going to explode inside yeah it really does happen that way when i first started doing that it would like begin to burn and then it felt like my whole body was going to explode and the longer i waited to say something and the whole time the holy spirit is saying open your mouth open your mouth i don't know what to say open your mouth you gotta open your mouth step up and open your mouth there were no real lessons about that but i just honestly say open your mouth and say it to whoever it's for and make sure it's supposed to be spoken sometimes god shares things with you so you can pray right so you have to discern is this something that i can say in love that will help them change or am i wanting to do this because my flesh is really happy i can bash them god doesn't bash he shares he gives correction and then direction but he does it in love man so what i have is good news i have good news for us good news for america and not only that the countries he's shifting around this world like korea and that will be one land it will be one country without communism or a war people are thinking that's just not going to happen without a war i went yes it is it will happen because this is god's plan and if he can shift the mind and the focus of that north america north korean president then it will happen and while i was in korea i was there to do eight meetings in 10 days i lost like 15 pounds yesterday seafood yes the brazil nuts were really good the pretzels brazil nuts and oranges is what i ate for 10 days but they were delicious as long as i didn't have to eat the tea [Laughter] and god said i'm going to date him this is back before i'm going to bait he just called him kim i'm going to bake him with big business and everybody's going to wipe him out and get him off the face of the earth or else he would do that himself actually god said if i wait much longer he may blow himself up because their stuff doesn't work well he didn't want him to blow himself up he was not happy with what he's doing but guess what his soul was filled with that stuff by his own father it was filled from the time he's little war war war war war and so what did he know war he didn't know what well but that's what he knew so god said i'm going to shift his heart and focus to big business and he will want to do the business when he sees it so he used the olympics as bait here's south korea making millions of dollars from people all over the world coming to see those olympics and when the person who sent there to check it out came back and said do you know what there is no fear they don't have fear all those people coming to visit and they're all applauding and yelling and cheering and they're spending money and spending money and spending money but no one's afraid because they're happy they're celebrating something we don't even think about i don't think they had a team did they anyway they weren't thinking in that way because the mind of their leader was not even considering that would be possible he was actually in fear that's why he was always wanting a war and wipe out people before they got and he was living with fear in him and god said i'm shifting him to consider doing big business and that's what his focus is he still has a lot of changes i'm not by any means saying he is perfect but his focus has shifted amen and if people don't like it they've been around him they won't last very long because he already has seen evidence that you can have a different life so don't don't consider don't just consider that no one you know all things are possible with god and that's not the only country he's going to do that to he's going to shift governments and then when he shifts the government he will shape the nations and doors will open for us to go and share the gospel where we never could before and it's going to be a long window not a short few weeks or months there's people that believe what i say but there's one thing they don't agree with they think that the rafters coming in about three months but they said that six years ago i went just no we don't want to discuss that right now i'm discussing what is the now time of god that's the future you can't change it you can't make it happen you don't know that day so how about if we just agree together to do what god wants us to do now amen amen so one of the focuses on heaven is to shift nations that is by reaching the leaders of those nations or removing that leader and putting one in there that will be shifted so you're going to see a lot of activity around this world especially in governments and some of them may not be the ones you expected to do something but korea is a good example because this i know there's wars and rumors of wars there'll be more rumors than wars and when something like that happens it won't be a long one because the other side will be dealt with swiftly and quickly because this is a different time on the earth well how can you talk like that because it's what god is saying this is what he wants now we're not living the way we did 50 years ago or even 20 years ago we're not living that way we have a whole new way we could live called heaven culture and there's a way you live that we're not automatically just going to be showered with little fuzzy things and the next day everybody's going to live on earth like they did in heaven we have to be living examples of that and people will see our lives we'll be a living testimony on this earth and you can have a life like they do in heaven and what is that like no fear no wars no hate no laugh no sickness no disease excitement joy celebration adventure the presence of god everywhere in your life that's the way they live in heaven that's heaven culture honor is given to people no one is rejected there's no offense there's no regrets there's no worry about regrets in heaven no one's going to be feeling feel like that they were crushed down because they didn't do right on this earth you remember your life but you use it to the glory of god and what he did and how much he loved you to make sure you got there amen amen so this is this is a whole new time and he's not saying you can't come if you're in this denomination if you have to be in this denomination too common to be a part of this otherwise you just can't come that's not from heaven either no there's one requirement if you receive and believe in your heart that jesus christ died for your sins and you repent for those sins and he washes you inside with a shower of his blood and wipes all that away like it never happened and you are counted righteous and your name is written in the lamb's book of life then your whole focus should change with god's focus on you because people who are not believers cannot do these things they do not have power over the part of the enemy the host will not listen to anyone who is a non-believer they're not going to listen to them they can see inside of everybody you either have light or you have gray or you have darkness in your soul that's what's there there's either light darkness or gray you don't want gray amen and the enemy because those are spiritual beings they see spiritual things about you now i don't give them any ammunition i'm not giving them any ammunition i have ammunition i'm going to focus on them but with all that you get with what god has planned for us right now you also can have uh your greatest desires in your heart yes that are for good it will be his pleasure to give those to you amen when you start operating like this when you start pursuing heaven culture your needs become this is what he personally told me your knees become his responsibility and your desires become his pleasure the people living in utter darkness who don't know any of this they see no hope they don't even think they have a future that's why it's important for us to be a living testimony amen and we live in one of the greatest countries in this world we do another country's focusing on is is of course israel and i knew something major was going to happen in israel god said i'm going to bless them every time they get attacked every time someone threatens to attack them i'm going to bless israel they're going to walk in favor with me divine favor with me and i will give great friends who are jews to americans who know me and they will do big business together and jews know how to do big business trust me he said i will bless them above measure and it will protect them and it will keep them they will not be wiped out he said america belongs to me and now the greatest friends is the the one who who is over israel the one who's over america are now great friends together and so both blessed both will be greatly blessed because of this so you can see more blessings coming and for the first time in a long time because a lot of the warring has stopped because now of course you know of course our embassy's over there and israel's embassy has been shifted to where it should have always been yeah and i mean trump pretty much said if you attack them you're attacking us we will come after you because he's he is serious about being friends with his not going to give billions of dollars away to our enemies amen so justice is coming to this country to our lives and there's a whole atmosphere of justice that was actually just shifted into our country because of the supreme court more and more you will see justice for believers who get dragged into court who have court cases uh and they're innocent more and more you will hear because in the past you'd always hear they've either taken it somewhere else you're going to retry it they found something else you actually hear real justice being given to them amen so this is a real powerful time a time to celebrate and to be joyful for us and if you have family members that don't like you know our president just pray for them and let them love them and let them live their life they're still going to benefit from all of it anyway and i have found this to be true you yourself probably can't change their mind a lot of people wear themself out trying to prove to their family members that they need jesus and it's probably going to be someone else in this world that does that not you pray for them hug them love them let them know you love them you're praying for them but don't get into fights every time you come together okay make sure you have time for love for family and you may notice a little bit of change in them if they don't think every time you come it's going to come up get in your prayer closet send the host of heaven against the demonic trying to control their lives release the anointing into them that's what breaks the yoke of darkness over them there are things that you can do but don't waste your whole life that's right you know trying to convince somebody that doesn't want that you cannot make them take it amen it has to be a choice i do know that major restorations are coming from families who've been apart for years and you may see a lot of that happening this christmas especially this christmas god's marking is a time a major time for restoration and family members to break down those barriers between them so you can expect to hear about that happening or you might have that happen yourself that god's in that time in in that christmas christmas season will be a time of great restoration for families in this earth so and heaven does heaven does like christmas by the way [Music] you wouldn't make christmas town in heaven if you've never heard the truth about uh nicholas and how he lived his life when he was on this earth you don't really know what he was like he was not a necessarily the happiest person in the world he was tough he was hard and he did not like anyone who spoke against the gospel he would take his staff and use it for other purposes yes go watch saving christmas oh yeah i think um kirk cameron kirk cameron made a movie called saving christmas everybody should look that up and watch it you should watch it he tells the true story he tells the true story about nick or nicholas and how his life was back in his day and it is quite humorous but it's quite true and you see a whole different way to explain christmas or celebrate christmas but god loves it he loves all the lights he likes the gift giving he loves the fact that sometimes it is the only time in someone's life that they forgive yes it is sometimes it's the only time of the year that they actually give money to others to help them amen it is really it's not something bad that link everything to some satanic ritual that was way back when but i have news for you heaven was there before all that stuff was here and all the enemy did was he takes it he copycats it and so that it looks like it's all evil when he's taking something that's good that's from god and he hates god so in any way he can make something look bad he never makes anything look good except sinning so a lot of the things that he says that everybody thinks now halloween that belongs to satan that's right don't celebrate it for the same reason i would tell you to you know get on heaven's side look up all right uh all those evil practices they show in in the halloween it is satan's highest day of the year and he wants people to celebrate his images and and it also brings fear into people especially children and you do draw things to you so you don't want to wear any kind of image that belongs to the enemy and i don't mind if you don't want me to say that anymore you don't want to hear me anymore don't listen to it but i'm telling you truth because i'm a seer and i see the things that follow those kids down the street when they're wearing like ghoulish things or demonic things you're saying come on yes because you're wearing your image that's right amen so everybody's listening everybody here do not celebrate that day and one day we will our company have a festival of light on that same day and we will celebrate heaven on that day and we'll celebrate life and joy and happiness and goodness and uh we are going to make calendars and on october 31st on that calendar it will say celebrate life we will not honor even mention the other side amen and i know my dad will tell us all the time don't go out and do that well my mom would let us because she was never churched or anything and my dad would pray and pray and pray that we would never be affected by it he just had a connection to heaven and eventually i saw it being you see i'm like okay i could tell you dad what i saw and after that we wouldn't we wouldn't do it anymore we would give stuff out we didn't shut our door and shut people out we would give them a track with a piece of candy when they came to the door okay we'd have it wrapped around or is a part of it we would give it to them they're not gonna throw it away okay they'll take it home drive it home take it out of their bag and it'll be put somewhere but somebody might see it so we do bless people we bless people we know a lot of them don't have a clue about that but uh you know i'm always going to tell you the truth amen celebrate christmas yes give people gifts that have helped you throughout your life and maybe you've never said thank you it could be something simple you know i don't know the guy in the toll booth who has you know has to take your money all day long and go over the bridge we don't have those anymore in our city thank you god there was one person who ran for mayor nobody ever remembers anything about him but one thing he got rid of the toe booth that was his election promise and he actually kept it none of the rest of them so we remember him so i just want you to stay excited about this time and uh i have a few more minutes we're going to stop and take up an offering the holy spirit said don't miss letting them give so we're going to go ahead and take up the offering and uh to be a partner with us and what we do and i tell people what you're doing is you're helping to reveal heaven on this earth when you help uh partner with us and you give to us and you're blessing heaven at the same time because this is heaven's plan i did not sit in my room one day and come up with all this that was not on my list my list was i will be in big business one day and i will have a nice loft apartment somewhere and it will only be me father son and holy spirit with a wonderful life that was my plan i only got one part of that plan father son and holy spirit with me for the rest of my life [Laughter] they had their own plan and i was push whacked [Laughter] so and the other thing i'm gonna ask also is anybody who's watching this if you have not given to river rock church i would not be here sharing these words if he had not invited me that's right so even if he's met his expenses i would like for you to go to his site and give money to them they have a big project ahead of them they're going to help people with are you kidding is what my dad and all of us kids did for most of our lives we took food to people we took supplies to people we helped them move into homes we painted seniors homes we we have a heart to help so that's what i see with all this yeah and they didn't ask for it okay this is the thing they did not ask for this this was god's plan if you've given yourself to god expect the unexpected amen this is the unexpected but that is not normal for major companies to call you up and say i have traffic trainer loads of stuff to give to you do you want it i know people who beat dom the doors of those places say can you give some stuff to us to help with our project they didn't even say that they don't even have a place to put it and yet here it is and it's coming and it's not going to stop so they need a warehouse and not some cheap one that they have to spend half a million dollars fixing i want them to have a wonderful one amen amen so please give if you have not given and you're watching this you need to send some money to pastor eric at river rock church for this project amen and then you have a part of that reward no matter where it happens this is how god does he will give you reward like eric will get because you're helping him to do this he didn't ask me to do this god told me to do it he said you're going to bless my son eric you're going to bless riverrot who's invited you time and time again no matter how wild you are or the things that you say he obeys you obey i want to help him this is my plan it's his plan eric so you're not going to escape it so people please remember them but right now we're going to take up an offering uh for me to help me in what i do we have a lot of big plans weather warriors is gonna be one of them he's not gonna let us drop that and uh our whole women's thing we have will go worldwide the wonder women and now we're adding on top of that something for all the men called the dread champions because hell will drive you if anybody does anything it should be held dreading you amen you wake up in the morning they start getting terrified and so we have a lot of things we have our wonder woman event coming up we have our champions event coming up and next year we'll also add to that our host initiative event and our spirit realm boot camp which every member of the body of christ needs that so they know what the spirit realm is what happens there what authority do you have there how do you use that authority why is it necessary to know about in your life because the veil between the spirit realm and the natural realm is getting thinner we we really hope to see an angel one day one day they'll be everywhere and you will see them but there will be both sides and the other side will try to influence people too and you'll see them so why not know this is going to happen on this earth it's going to happen and so you're hearing this it's going to happen you will see angels you'll see them in your home living in your hands home going back to heaven and forth in your home they may have some come to the front door and knock and the other side will be happening they'll be trying to make friends with people and trying to prove that they're good too i'm talking about demons because so many of the kids games and videos and movies are actually helping to introduce them as something that is normal and so you have to have a voice that tells you this is going to happen it's important to know about this and people change when they have spirit around boot camp and they understand that's not just a mysterious unseen realm that is a real literal round where things travel in it there's highways in it there's places in it there's things that you need to know about that's where your real authority is when you speak and take authority your king or uh your king a priest or a lord in the spiritual level of authority so you have to know what that spiritual what that spirit realm is amen so make up checks to river rock church and then they'll just give me one check and i think you at the envelopes that are there in front of you somewhere i think you can give me your card if you want to and i will bless all of it in just a few minutes i i don't like to stop talking because i know i only have a little bit of time left here tonight because we also have what's tomorrow sunday so they have sunday morning and um and uh is my meeting sunday night 6 p.m and so so they got two meetings tomorrow they got their regular sunday morning meeting and then i will be back six o'clock tomorrow night here there's three meetings here that eric invited me to and then monday night um they're holding one here for the women's up for a glow international what used to be women's above the seventh of god they've changed it to a glow international so the men can come too and i've i've done a global international meetings and some people are surprised that the assembly god lets me speak but when i was growing up that was the denomination we went to we went there we were faithful we helped our our pastor and we're on part of his volunteer team and we love them they helped put a lot of god in us they put us on that right road that's where i got saved i was in the assembly god church my dad was a lay minister with them and my grandmother was a missionary so we do love that denomination and they're getting more and more of holy spirit in heaven they want the supernatural they want to know about heaven encounters and so monday night we will have another meeting here so i'm not done amen so please get ready to give your offering and uh we're going to let them take it up i'm not going to sing a song to you thank you would leave or you would cry i said well i've seen people cry not from the anointing not my gift all my kids were fussed in the back of the car i would sing and they would cry and they would repent and they would stop when they got older it would make me sing in the car with their friends when they were about 11 or 12. they wanted to make them laugh too maybe in heaven one day but on the earth that's not my gift and i don't dance either although i teach a dance to everybody we might do that tomorrow night the revelation dance it's like children you feel like children right there doing this and i'm wrong yes i saw it down in the phone i'm like well god said you're going to teach it and let me and then my daughters looked at me and went we don't have to help do we because i've been thrown out of jazzercise classes [Laughter] i was on like the step thing right little step thing you've never been there don't don't unless you know what you're doing and they do like step one two one two one one two two and they were like on step fifteen and i'm like one two or is it one one two and i looked up and everyone in the mirror was watching me and and i was like down front somewhere with my sister who dragged me in there not down john didn't drag me there and the instructor stopped saying okay you back there you yeah you you are going to go to the back of the room in the corner because you can't keep up and everyone is trying to do except now they're watching you so would you go back there please that didn't hurt my feelings i told my sister this is not going to work so i'm in the in the back in the corner i'm still doing the same thing you know is this one two one one two because i have not gifted in that either and again the music was rocking and people were doing nothing because then they were trying to look behind everybody in the mirror to see what i was doing so i was asked to leave and i was like yes amen i believe now that was pretty much the same thing that happened to me in eighth grade when i tried out for chorus i wasn't always bold you know i would go for it anyway and they so they had the auditions you know how that happens they let anybody anybody who wants you to be in the course just come audition so we know where to place you and i went and they were singing that dough ready me thing and i'm halfway through and the people are laughing so hard they're crying i'm saying the director was crying the people there to audition were crying and go stop this is the joke isn't it and what yes it is that was not written on my scroll but by speaking wildly and boldly about what god wants regardless of what people think about you to not care when people bash me or whatever they try to do um i don't know they make yourself a target on uh facebook or youtube or twitter and whatever that new thing is we're gonna be doing instagram instagram and we're already doing podcasts we're going to be doing webinars guys it'll put you out a lot more online and i just ignore everybody out there i do not have time to stop and justify myself and uh i don't have time it's wasting time i just start with you know i love you but you're banned [Laughter] we got a lot of banding done during the election i mean like a lot of people those three nights when god said i'm going to tell you all the characteristics and the qualities of this person i have chosen for president and everybody was trying to guess who that was and and our viewing audience went from like it went from like you know 20 30 000 to 200 000 overnight and then 800 000 because and so on that fourth day when i had when god revealed who it was i have not chosen a pastor for your president i have not chosen an apostle or i mean i went through the whole five whole thing i haven't chosen any of those because you don't need them i have chosen a businessman and this name is donald j and it was like bash back like we were up all night long you know trying to get all the bachelors off of here and i think that what really very quite really a whole lot was a very small percentage but the rest of them were celebrating celebrating celebrating and then they went to the voting booth and they voted amen so it was worth it and this is god saying this to me this is the father he said i'm gonna throw you so far out there you are never coming back i'm putting you on a political platform a lot of people aren't going to like what you say but i like it so i'm just letting you know your life is going to be over completely because i'm following you out there and i'm not bringing you back off that political platform and trump's winning and i don't care what anyone says because i'm voting this time and i'm turning that map red so whether they like it or not this is going to happen and you're going to let them all know and i said amen and i had pastors calling me saying are you sure you want to say that you you are you know you're risking your entire reputation now i thought we weren't supposed to have one amen is that not true so this is not my reputation that i'm ruining at all no i don't have a reputation i don't even have an opinion i'm just going to say what god wants and a lot of times that's never popular so why should it be any different amen amen people can fight and kick all they want to you will watch trump re-elected in 2020 and then you will see pence elected and then can three elect him and i don't know who he's gonna pick but god's still talking to me about that person whoever pence picks for his vice president and he will seriously consider that he's a very strong believer seriously whoever he picks is going to win yes because pence will win that term and then they will be president also this other person for eight years 24 years of god in our white house there will be so many major chips you know into into what god wants in this country and god has told me that doesn't mean that that i won't let other people still win he said at one point it will be a moderate there will be a moderate person elected uh this is after pence's vice president and after all that he said but even still that i'm so rad if we change america people will come here to find god they'll come to find me amen they'll get the american dream some of them but that won't be their focus the folks will become to find me amen so you can celebrate your lives and your children your grandchildren your great grandchildren will live in a whole different time that we didn't live in amen and i'm 66 i'm still young god calls me a baby you know uh america is a baby he says america is a baby amen yes we're only a couple hundred years old yes when you put us up to england and these other countries and see how long they've been around that israel you know china how long have they been here we are a baby and saint wants to destroy the baby he's always afraid of the baby he always has been well we're a baby but we're going to grow up amen we're going up strong and happy and filled with god and uh there'll still be things arise in our country but they'll be dealt with swiftly there will be no anarchy in the streets in our country that we know is trying to overthrow each other in our country which has always been one of the devil's plans and he doesn't know what he's messing with and this is what god said when they kept trying to say there's going to be you know anarchy in the streets and then the international guard will be called and take control of everything and there's half a million body bags waiting in uh in missouri for the bodies what happened from all this war in the streets and god's like laughing in heaven he said that's not my plan and that is not going to happen he said besides the fact that they don't understand that they aren't ever going to get their weapons god said they won't ever get their guns in america there's too many he rednecks that there's too many rednecks in america they all got guns they're not giving any of them up but they will use them so they can forget about getting their guns because it is our right to protect ourselves in other countries that are like third world countries that happened because they took away the right to bear arms they have no voice in their country they have no way to protect themselves in their country that's why they're crushed down and god said leaders who are presidents can be great leaders in the way if they want good for their country and if they want to do what is right for the country then their country can be great he said but dictators if you're a dictator then you hate what is right most of the time you only want what you want it has to be only your way and you crush if you don't get your way you take away all the rights of the people that way they can be controlled they can only operate oh it sounds like the market of east and then they can only operate the way you allow them to operate he said but america is not that country amen and i will pray for all of us stand up and pray for those other countries right now that are going through shifts in their government that they will hear god and they will do what is right amen amen so we say we can all repeat this god our father jesus christ our king our king holy spirit our best friend we stand in the gap for all those countries that don't have justice liberty or freedom we pray on their behalf that you will help them open the eyes of their leaders to see what is right and to go after what is right we pray those people be loved and cared for they will have no more wars or poverty or disease in their countries we pray that you will bless them and if necessary remove the wicked leaders because when the righteous rules the people rejoice that we declare over those countries we thank you for putting us in america we thank you for blessing america and we say god bless this world you made it with your hands you love this earth help us to love more and care more for others and let it be honored as it is in heaven amen [Music] amen and so father i just blessed all the people who came tonight ask you to bless them when they rise up and when they lie down let them have visions let them have dreams father let them have encounters in heaven let them visibly see their destiny to know why you sent them to know you more to receive revelation and i pray that their souls will prosper father and they will prosper and live in divine health and have declare over each one of them increase in every way for their giving tonight god let it multiply even as it was given and let it multiply in their bank accounts in their purses in their wallets that people bring money unexpected money unexpected suddenlies of their finances to shift overnight god and i declare a hundred and a thousand folk return over this offering father like if their restoration with their loved ones god that there will be peace between them father let's just be the best christmas they have ever had father let joy and celebration be in their hearts and a great future for their destiny father and i declare over their seed over their children and over their grandchildren and over their great great great grandchildren to a thousand generations god may they know you love you serve you may they all be together in heaven and in the future and i bless them and ask you to show you show them your goodness is everyone sad amen thank you and everyone also watching i bless you all so that blessing is for you too and everyone say hello world we bless you we bless you god bless your people amen

welcome everybody here we are catker on studio oq one haven't you ever wondered in these days it would be great if we just knew the truth because let me tell you there's crazy wild things going on out there see look i dress professional does that help people to believe because actually you know god's revelations are for those who will receive them not for those who bash them so today you will hear god's reality and jen is pointing her finger at me oh hi i'm looking in the wrong place see we flipped our ipad because you know our our professional crew they're not here today it's just jen and i you know why we love you and never forget we love you if everything went down for a while i hope you would be careful about how much cake you're eating [Laughter] we will be addressing that before we're done tonight you now this is going to be a short broadcast number one my husband's waiting to eat and i've learned from men if the world's falling apart which it's not if they're at war in a bunker where the missile is flying past them that probably doesn't happen that way however i will tell you this men have to eat all you women who are married say amen because i have been married for 43 years and this is not about my marriage but why not bring it into play i have learned how to get along with my husband and love him not want to run him out of town on a rail some of you if you're in your 10th 12th year of marriage you may feel that way please hang in there okay god brought you that man and you know what i will address this another guy the holy spirit said continue on with what you have to say and they have asked me to talk about god's reality which is actually the thing we should want to know the most and actually his reality is the truth a lot of fake news going on everybody you've known that for months probably years but right now with the stuff going on right now in washington dc and everything else there's a lot of stuff being flown out there for you to listen to or you to watch i hope you find some truth in some of it some of it's like so far out there is from outer space some of us just on wi-fi space some of it i'm not quite sure where it's from i just know one thing i listen to god i hear him well i have known him for some time now which is his decision to put me out there i was always the person that wanted to hide because i didn't need anybody uh personally i had a try therefore i had all the validation or war that i wanted so right now i can persevere and continue on i forgive everyone out there please do not waste your time trying to explain to people who don't want to hear an explanation or who don't want the truth just pray for them and ignore them like they said nothing whatsoever because that's actually the best thing you can do and i know because more people are watching and listening you're always going to get more of the side that is clueless who hates everybody who has their own mindset and doesn't want anyone else's who are just angry and they want to vent on everybody right now i happen to be a bull's-eye but i'm also a bull's-eye for god that part i love so i forgive everybody in advance god act like they never said it especially if it was one of your prophets jumping off the path off the train or out into nowhere please forgive them and help them to know the truth so they can be free they can be powerful for you and not a voice for the enemy because right now the reality god's reality is this is not a doom and gloom time this is not a time to be in fear to tolerate fear or participate with fear it's a time to be great with god excited about his plans and please pursue making plans for your life like you were before all this ever happened because it will be like it never happened and that is god's reality he has a moment in time to shift us and accelerate us forward but before he does that he will cleanse the platform expose the darkness and boy is there a lot of that to expose and it doesn't matter what group it's being disposed from it will be exposed in this time and god will also deal with it in this time why because of all the powerful things he has planned for us i have been there i have seen it it is going to be great your children's future is so fantastic it will not be filled with fear it will not be filled with evil it will not be filled with having to run and escape somewhere hide under your school desk you know that's not what's happening right now it's god asking us to trust him until his time comes to show it all and trust me you wonder what time is going to happen you will see it you'll see the exposure you'll see the arrest you'll see the fraud he will not let anyone escape with justice not being brought to them justice will be served that's what he says so wait for the justice people is so worth it to love your family spend time with them go on as normal as you possibly can until it's wiped out disposed of put away wiped off and god will set in place the ones he trusts to speak to you now we have several things we want to talk about in this broadcast so i'll just give you a little what is it called an outline an index whatever you want to call it okay we will discuss the reality of what god is doing right now we will discuss the earthquakes that started the shaking that god said on november the 4th of 2020 when the ground begins to shake wait for the great exposure of fraud to begin to happen and when it's done it will all be dealt with it will all be brought to justice i don't need to name any names to let you know that this is what he's doing so on november the 4th things started shaking and guess what even up to right now they are still shaking not just here in america all over the world some of them cannot even be explained why because sometimes in the spirit realm what they're doing is so powerful there's always a little bit of that that laps over into this natural realm and people can feel it sometimes they can hear it and let me tell you that shaking and the winds being released that is god moving on this earth yes i mean the father moving on the earth you remember what happened the first time he did that the mountains caught on fire well he wants your souls to catch on fire for him not in fear not thinking you needed to be rescued this is god's reality now we've jumped to that subject god has a reality and his reality is this is a powerful exciting time to be alive he has never changed that some people have changed it some people are jumping off that train right now thinking that we're going to be derailed and there'll be a crash i think the future will take a crash because you cannot speak for god saying adamantly this is what he has said and this is what he's going to do and just because you don't know the time you think it's not gonna happen that is an immaturity in the prophets of god you need to know if he says something to you or showed you and said this will happen just because it's not a year window of time or man's window of time it doesn't mean it won't happen you can't back up you can't stop going forward the true prophets of god right now are speaking greatness the power of god the joy of the lord celebration celebration celebration is coming to america that's what his true prophets are saying if you hear them saying there's doom and gloom let's go we're going into the deep darkness guess who they're listening to not god the enemy has a voice too and when you accept fear he'll make sure satan well make sure you hear his voice and then you'll believe it and then you run after it and then you repeat it does this sound like a cycle i can tell you right now god wants you to believe him and trust him satan does not hold your life in his hand that doesn't happen to the very end and you most likely won't be here unless you're several hundred years old you are in the greatest days god designed to be on the earth he's just setting it up i'm sorry it didn't happen on the third i'm sorry it didn't happen so far in january that doesn't mean he's not doing it no because i do have something a lot don't i has a seer anointing if you were a prophet and you could see into the spirit you would right now see demons quaking in fear sliming their way to get out of the way because they know and they can see god is walking across this nation they're terrified now because they know their plans are going up in smoke literally they're running away as fast as they can so they don't get burnt by the fire of god and let me tell you your prayers are so powerful when you stand with god and you make declarations it begins to release something in the spirit realm that does cause fear and the camp of the enemy the enemy is not man the enemy is satan he just uses man he uses him for his own purposes to speak his words to say what his plans are his plans are never good and they don't bring hope or joy to anybody so don't listen to anyone who's speaking in doom and gloom and hate and cowering and having to put up with a horrible future maybe they want that future i don't the moral majority in this country don't want that future the true body of christ who are all knowing that god is going to move his hand when he is ready whether it is tomorrow or not you may hold your finger out and say you're fake news you're a fake leader we don't receive you we don't celebrate what you've said because fraud has been committed not sure that facebook will let me keep this one up make sure you're taping it make sure you make a copy of it and keep it all right and i'm telling you anything you want to keep that's been said and spoken or written make a paper copy go find your printer if you didn't forget what that was print it so you may hold it in the time i had should you for a few weeks need to do that if not i hope you're taking notes because i will tell you this everything god has spoken that god himself has spoken it will happen and it will be great and there will be celebration in the streets so the reality of god is make your stand and don't be moved and while you're waiting celebrate why does god say celebrate that shows the enemy and your friends that you're standing in faith your faith isn't going to be stolen from you it will be accelerated and guess what all your friends and family that made fun of you will remember the words you said to them and when what god's going to do happens they will be running to you for answers that is the reality of right now this whole week accelerate your faith trust god and let him hear you say that let's say it together father in heaven father in heaven i choose with my will i choose with my will to choose your promises to choose your promise and your plan and your plan over man's over for the enemies or the enemies i am your child i am your child i will serve no more than god i will serve no other you except you your son jesus christ your son jesus and the holy spirit and holy spirit you made everything you made everything you know everything you know everything you have great thoughts for me you have great thoughts for me and great plans for me and great plans those plans those plans i will receive i will receive and i will run after them and i will run after them everything everything is about to change it's about to change jesus name in jesus name amen amen there you go you said it with your own mouth don't step back from those words they are powerful teach your children to celebrate what jesus christ did for them and what his plans are for right now on this earth this is not a joke this is not a recording i'm live see here i'll pinch myself this is a real life this is god's reality all the rest of it is a smoke screen by satan wanting to try to convince us that we're going down life is going down the country's going down that's awfully funny i remember the last time god showed up when satan thought he won he got burnt i can expect to see the same i've seen demons slinking away from everything running from dc as fast as they can you know what that means if the enemy's power is left great confusion will begin to fall on the others get ready for a real show that's all i can say remember whose life you are in their hands right that life is yours the decision is yours the word should be yours that you agree with life and not death god says to choose life and to speak life whatever is a good report sir remind you of the word those words you declare so if you hear things that aren't a good report we know where that came from no matter who is saying them pray for those people do not bash those people man if they ever needed help it would be right now i don't care how major a prophet it is who all of a sudden overnight has decided the bad stuff is going to happen because guess what they're looking with their natural eyes and when god says they begin to do that this is what they see they can see as far as their hand and that's it but when you stay focused on god keep your eyes on him stay excited don't step back on the word and you will be accelerated and you will be prospered and you will be blessed and you will have the greatest memories that you can tell your children and your grandchildren you will not believe what happened in this beginning of this divine decade boy we had to make a stand so remember to celebrate and i will show you the cake in just a minute jen is waving me down keep us on track jen whatever whatever are we supposed to talk about um well you wanted to mention the earthquakes yes november the 4th was when god actually began to talk about what would happen and i can go back on the elijah list and re-share the november 4th uh facebook live with you and steve yeah so everyone can hear when you said that oh yeah that actual uh broadcast was so powerful and really neither one of us probably knew what god would say he just knew he wanted to speak after november the 3rd which of course we know was election day god knew exactly what would happen so it is very powerful that god since november the 4th what he said would happen has been happening you just haven't seen and heard it but trust me you will but on november the 4th that day when he said when the ground begins to shake look for the beginning of the landslide a fraud what happened on november the 4th john well there was a earthquake in yosemite valley california there you go that's the usa and um the thing that we thought was also amazing was the day of the election yes because remember they they they stopped counting they stopped counting at midnight or 1am something like that and then there was a earthquake around 2 58 i'm trying to remember where it was in the morning yeah in the morning that would have been eight pm that would have been the fourth probably when stuff was going earthquake i think it was was it alaska falls pass alaska of all names false past alaska are you kidding is that crazy i think god was saying something yeah and then of course we all know they mysteriously got all those votes that came in at 3am yes hey that's just a few minutes after 2 52 a.m not only that there was a second earthquake in alaska at 5 35 p.m so all those hours going by we're going to find out about all that really soon but where else in the world on november 4th were the earthquakes there was one in canada there was the philippines greece turkey actually many one yeah there was a lot have they stopped since then no not at all but not just the earthquakes there's been mysteriously mysterious ground shakings everywhere that's not reported that's right they don't know where it's come from and also there's been activities a host of heaven people unusual gust of winds that have come out of nowhere yes that were not natural right they weren't like a natural wind i'm telling you god why would god say that about the shaking it's to encourage you and let you know he is doing things that you cannot see right now but everything that is seen this is what the word says everything this scene was made by that which was unseen the unseen is the spirit realm it is a father son and holy spirit's activities and there is a lot of that going on they are driving things out moving things into position that they will need their place there for what is going to happen this week will be key i'm not saying tomorrow i'm not promising anything tomorrow except god won't stop moving and doing things until all of this is shown and you will see it with your natural eyes and hear it with your ears and then there'll be the great celebration your job is to stay in faith stand and stand therefore but don't stand looking sorry and sad and fearful remember please to pray for all those who are backing up apologizing for things they said there's nothing to apologize for people the truth will be made known and no one will escape knowing about it no one will escape being uncovered that did it so pray for those who've jumped off the train and backed up and god pray that they be reached that they know the truth and tell the truth to not get people to fear don't let people put fear in you then the enemy has something in you he can use it won't stop god from what he's going to do but why not enjoy every day of your life let god says you choose to be happy if no one else does heaven is happy heaven is excited we thought we would drink bring these up because we've had a lot of questions the last broadcast we did has already reached a hundred and forty two thousand people what they want to hear somebody who's hearing god and gives them hope god always brings hope so are you saying that even if a certain someone is sworn in on the 20th yes i think and we all wake up on the 21st yes and he still thinks he's in that position it means we should still stand strong stand strong and know this until it's all revealed it isn't over that's right god has the final say and when he says it and when it is all done somebody will be moving back in the white house and guess what they know it too there's no fear in the lives of those who just moved out they already know that they will be back so just remember covert activities hey guys just be thankful god didn't ask us to wait 120 years like he did with noah he's just wanting us to wait a little while so keep holding on it's gonna happen the rain is coming he keeps telling me the rain is coming the rain is the evidence but this time it's the enemy's camp that's going to be flooded and destroyed that's right and we are not for violence of any kind well maybe spiritual violence did you know there's a godly violence a spiritual violence that you wore in the spirit against satan against the demonic armies that is certainly okay we don't want to have violence against people although the group that says they don't want it seem to be doing it you already know what i'm talking about right god didn't intend us to have to put up or tolerate violence not in this country not in our lives actually not for those who believe him in this day you won't have to die to show who god is but you will have to live and live powerfully and rule and reign with christ in this world right now and he is not afraid was there anything else we were going to talk about jenna oh yes the holy spirit just reminded me guess what i still have lights on outside if at all possible go put some lights back up maybe you haven't taken them down the light represents god so let's leave some light up until the real inauguration happens maybe leave up the red lights red and white lights very white would be great that would be great but if you only got white we'll take that we're leaving ours up i hope you leave yours up i hope they're seeing everywhere and people go blows up we have hope for a future we are trusting our god our god is light why not put something up outside or in your window that represents god that's who our savior is that's someone who loves us that's the one who made you even the other side who's very confused right now i know jen wants to hurry so she can have cake yes by the way we will now discuss the cake when i said eat cake i didn't mean eat a whole cake i know some of you are taking advantage of that i know i have seen the comments okay when this is over you may have to have a flash weight loss program we will help

all the way up to any age of men to come we have a powerful time we have a couple of the speakers i definitely will be speaking to you man you're not going to escape that we have powerful workshops and so i hope you'll come that is september what is that date jen let me go chat she's gonna go check for us [Laughter] we knew we would be doing something today i wasn't quite sure what to what to talk about so i have several things to share but definitely want to let you know these are one quest events that is one question catcher these are our own events and so that's not traveling somewhere else for somebody we get to say what god wants we have a powerful time from god we have importations at all of our events that means you're going to get something from heaven before you leave and what does that date jen september 11th and 12th september 11th and 12th all you men all you dread champions out there make sure you save that date make sure you plan to come it will be here in our city um we'll have more information on that probably once we get all the heavens invitation information out there for everybody in june then we will be posting our men's events so you can register men and then after that will be the women's event and it is called wonder women who will be doing signs and wonders it's just another name for the manifested daughters of god we have women come from all over

are all about heaven that's what this is about we reveal heaven to the earth we create heaven on earth through our products and through our stuff on our uh through our website so that's who we are we don't represent man okay so you need to know more of god more about heaven more about the future this is the place to come and check it out and i want to say hi to all the youtube viewers all you facebook viewers this is an amazing time we have some new software now everything will automatically be on youtube and facebook at the same time i look forward to new people if you don't know anything about me there's about 500 hours of me already on youtube how about that and it's all for free and by the way i wanted to mention this if you go watch some of my videos and there's commercials on those videos those were not put on there by me i did not put those commercials on there that was done through other people who show things that i do also i'm not going to put commercials on anything that i do i do it for you to enjoy to know more to be more to run your race powerfully in this time to crush the darkness and i do want to also mention besides the connection between youtube and facebook we also have a couple of new things we're doing and this is a real fun thing it's called on the go with cat you never know when that's going to be posted we have some new ones make sure you check out our playlist on itunes is that itunes no not itunes it's on youtube eventually maybe itunes but right now go to youtube check out our playlist for on the go with cat and it's going to be spontaneous things throughout the day places i go things that do or say we're just gonna we're gonna tape it and then we're gonna post it and you'll get to know more about what i do during the day it's not normal okay now you can check out the intro and you can check out the new intro right now we've actually created an intro for on the go with cat so when you see that you're going to know this is going to be something exciting or fun or interesting and so if you're watching [Music] so anyway that was awesome wasn't it anyway i love doing things where i can connect with people you know i come from a really big family for those who don't know me at all guess what what about the pink hair i am going to answer that question we recently had a question from somebody why do you have the pink hair so there's some people who've known why for like 15 years right i've had this pink hair for a very long time it's because god asked me to have this pink hair why heaven is different it is fantastic it is amazing and i represent heaven wherever i go and he wanted me to show it on the outside so how about that heaven's exciting and because he asked me to do it i obeyed i think god would appreciate it when we listen we hear and we obey that is what he loves so this is just really obedience of course i was not a pink care person that would make it too easy for me but i have gotten used to it and i want to bless the heart of god and so guess what yes i get it done every four weeks god didn't put this pink hair on my head i actually have to pay for it so again guardians own people thank you so much for supporting me we have many things planned for the future it's going to be really exciting around here and a lot of action going on not just here in our studio but around this world don't take your eyes off of korea god is still doing something with that also hollywood i am involved now in helping to create a spirit realm input for the resurrection of jesus christ movie and by the way i just need to give a tip it's not the one with mel gibson we bless mel gibson and pray for him continually he gave us a passion was that not amazing but this one is being done through a different whole group you go to the resurrection of jesus christ website you'll probably see me talking on that website and find out some more information they'll be putting a lot more on there we're working really hard i do sketches of the spirit realm of heaven of hell because i've been to those places and then my prophetic artist makes them amazing and these are scenes and images and beings that will actually be in that movie so god notified me that i would be involved in this several years ago so i was preparing myself all along to be a part but it's absolutely amazing that we will get to change the way people think about jesus christ about heaven about how the reality of both of those places and also what really happened in the spirit realm in the garden on the cross in hell on the third day when christ wasted the principalities and powers and took the keys of hell death and the grave you'll be seeing on the big screen in a few years it's it's a it's a big project but i'm going to enjoy being a part of it we do a lot of on the on the go with cat you see a lot of those things happening and i give you tips about what goes on with the making of a movie and so i'm looking forward to being a part of that also don't take your eyes off of london especially concerning the royalty boy there's stuff going on right now isn't there we're gonna hear about that from here too uh i'm sure that i have we'll have a lot more to share later but uh we love queen elizabeth we pray for her we pray for that whole country you know we america was kind of birthed out of that country i do know in the habitation of god coming to this earth that america and england will be doing things hand in hand for that move of god in this earth so don't take your eyes off of there either there's a lot of other things going on in this world i know there's violence in some areas there's disasters in some areas we're learning to take authority over all that because as a believer that is your right to rule and reign with christ to have authority over the weather because we're over it not under it we also host weather warriors here we host um the the host initiative which is the army of heaven working with us we also of course i already mentioned drug champions and wonder women we have a lot going on god has put on our plate and we're going to be doing great with all those things don't take your eyes off of trump now that's hard to do right because you know this broadcast couldn't go by without me mentioning trump who will win in 2020 look forward to celebrating with him i already am i'm sure that i'll be at the um inaugural prayer breakfast in washington dc uh last time i actually got to pray for not in person but i did pray for the president for pence and at that time it was awesome i will be doing a capitol hill broadcast sometime this year i'll let you know in advance if you're in washington dc at that time stop by the capitol outside and say hi to us i'll make sure you get those days it's going to be amazing god will be exposing darkness but i'm telling you he chose trump and he has not done with him yet i look forward to all that god is going to do through him through his administration and you know don't worry about the fake news okay don't worry about him on you are fake news okay you fake your fake news yes and guess what even heaven goes about that heaven's talking about all the stuff going on on the earth it's not like they're blinded from it they understand what's going on everybody's declaring and decreeing for things on this earth god cares about you he hasn't forgotten about you no matter who you are he loves you he sent his son to die for you and something new that god gave us assignment on was to put out a 20 20 calendar excuse me let me take a little drink from my i don't do demons cup there you go this is something that he had us actually i know it's probably already on there but you know i'm a hands-on person so here we go i'm not going to show you a lot about it he actually commissioned us to do a calendar on heaven itself and is called the world called heaven we still have some left if you haven't gotten yours go to revealingheaven.com click on the store and get your calendar every month there's an image of a place that actually exists in heaven it also talks about that place that i saw in heaven and in during the month the dates of that month we've added some special days that we've included about celebrating heaven or life we have two interactive months in this calendar where you actually send pictures of something to us and we're gonna have a lot of fun with that but this is a powerful calendar you're gonna know so much about heaven it makes a great gift for somebody no matter what time of year you give it to somebody it'll be something they'll probably keep for a very long time so i hope you'll check out uh our store make sure you check out the calendar a world called heaven last year we did one on the host of heaven and for the first time god really is revealing heaven in images on this earth because we work for god and this is heavens one of heaven's bases on the earth one quest international with one purpose from one god that is to reveal and create heaven on this earth i hope you will check us out again i look forward to talking to you again i'm just going to mention anything else jen on the calendar we have fun days like you were saying and the fun day for this month is um download from the idea zone day oh download from the idea zones that day that gives me another subject to talk about what does that mean there is an idea zone in heaven literally over the streets of gold there's this beautiful cloud that's got all these like thousands and thousands of pieces it looks like little pieces of glitter every one of those is a witty idea an invention and god sends waves of that idea zone down to the earth and drops them into the mind of man that's how we get all those amazing ideas and so we have that date put on the calendar in february make sure if you already have a 2020 calendar you check that date out that would be february the 4th no the third 25th the 25th see you can tell i've really studied this i'm going to have to really check it out a little bit more [Laughter] so anyway um i still are you are you done y'all need to not be pointing at things okay your crew y'all just need to know this is new we have new equipment new lights i'm excited about this so i'm learning right along with you okay is there anything else i need to be saying anything that god wants or anything he wants to say okay well i can tell you right now god's excited about this time he calls it the divine decade the next 10 years are going to be so powerful and so focused by god from heaven about things that will happen you will be amazed if you don't belong to god if you receive jesus christ make sure you do that the most important thing you do in your life is to make sure your name is written in the lamest book of life because you won't like the other option okay been the hell been there seeing that nobody wants to go there but heaven itself is an amazing place filled with fun with excitement with adventure and let me tell you when people go there to live don't cry for them we have friends we have family up there i celebrate with them all the time what a beautiful amazing place you live in the life of god itself so many things to do in heaven people get to see each other again you live near your family members i hope that's going to be okay with you and how about this one you get your pets in heaven only they won't be normal either there's not much that's normal about heaven everything is given to you for free all right you breathe in the life of god all the time you travel on light you travel unsound even your very worship you travel in heaven fantastic amazing places i think i'm going to have to have a special segment every now and then that is nothing but about having people really want to know what is it like and i tell people all the time instead of a funeral home they need to have party depots and that's where you sent from here to go live in heaven in your spiritual body your physical body will be resting that's what sleeps because people say what about the dead in christ when they rise that is your body your body is sleeping but your spirit man is very much alive in heaven eating the best food that ever existed with no weight gain or food allergies i'm sure someone's going to love the fact that i said that and i want to say hi to all my friends that i have met over the years i i do know quite a few people now either from facebook or just from traveling to many places here in america and even overseas and you know what i'm just going to mention this god does have plans for germany also i've been to stuttgart several times the people are wonderful they're precious people that lived there none of them wanted hitler by the way he is in hell that's just free for all of you out there whoever wondered no he didn't make it to heaven there was no place made for him he never had a mansion being built he didn't want anything but evil and uh whether you like this broadcast or not this is my time and god's time and we said he could say what he wanted to i want you know he's hanging on to me hook and hell there now you got a real visual right uh but let me tell you there is a place of torture for the wicked for the evil for those who hate god who who hate people you are going to go nowhere you have no future whatsoever satan will not give you anything except hate and so i just want to let you know that for free germany the people in germany are wonderful god created them to carry the glory and you know who thought he would steal it and use that country for his own purposes at which he did but those people are kind they're wonderful i want to say hi to all my friends and stu ca stinker i hope to see you again soon and i'm blessed about your brand new building you've gotten built god is really gonna prosper people who've been faithful for so long in this time and they'll be doing things around this world not just in your city or in your state you have to see beyond your own capabilities people you were made by god he has great plans for you don't let fear interfere don't cry and whine that the devil's been beating you up run him off crush the darkness push it back jesus christ said to all those who follow him i give you power over all the power of the enemy so why don't you use it speak and declare what the word says about things not from your own flesh don't let people in the flesh control you beat you up or misuse you loose it from your soul bind the love and the life and the power

[SPECIAL]Kat Kerr STRONG PROPHETIC AMERICA: THE SHAKING HAS BEGUN | April 19, 2021

or https://youtu.be/SXlG7gReb4Q
and being so happy i hope you are by the way i just want to start by saying i have talked to several my prophet friends just to make sure they're celebrating and guess what they are they have an all jumped ship hope you haven't jumped ship if you have we'll throw you a life raft anyway i had to of course come on i'm gonna come on every other day as long as we're still up i'll still be speaking and guess what i'm running forward with my race running forward with life with joy with celebration and with god in his plans and yes according to the title of this post the shaking has begun and i'm serious about that i'll tell you why i'm excited you should go back and look at on the largest streams the broadcast we did on november the 4th and what god himself had to say about all of this guess what he didn't give a date and i'm not giving a date i actually never have given a date i let god choose his time because man has their own time frame some people can wait a few days some a couple weeks but man i don't think anybody can go past a month except the ones who really know what god said and i can tell you what god's doing yes there is a line being drawn who will believe him and stand with him and who he can use and accelerate in these powerful days ahead and who will have to catch up so i hope you're not on the ketchup side that could mean several things i won't go there however i do want to tell everyone hello all you people who are still standing with what god said i celebrate you i congratulate you you have blessed the heart of god that you're not giving up your stand we all know what the bible says when you make a stand stand therefore you also know what it says right when you're going forward in the kingdom don't stab back or what you will not be fit in shape or ready for the kingdom so there you go that's god's words to you i hope you all who switched and jumped to the side of darkness and that's all there is is darkness and light right now get out of there while you can and be one of the ones who made a stand that you can celebrate and run in the streets and shout and yell that's exactly what's going to happen because life will win god always says to choose life stand with life participate with life not the other side you remember we prayed for mark zuckerberg right so he knows he still has a chance to switch back and do what he did when he started all this he just he designed and made a wonderful place for all of us to come and fellowship together get to see different pictures and videos and laugh and enjoy them and enjoy life and something happened to him please be praying for him okay this is a great place to do social networking and that's why it was designed but you can't let them ban you because you want god or you want what is right or you want life and so in them who don't even know what they're saying you don't realize what you're saying when you don't want to be on the other side and not decide god has chosen if you think he's run away and he's hiding somewhere in heaven that is not true did you feel the groan shake yet because you will you remember on november 4th god himself said when the ground begins to shake get ready for the landslide to expose everything and you know what god's plans are you've heard me say it from the very beginning from 2015 guess what he's not changed his plan what he is do is exposing all the darkness he's going to clean that platform off no matter where they are what they're saying what they're doing god's preparing us for the next 20 years of greatness no you don't have to get used to wearing masks for the rest of your life you don't have to social distance for the rest of your life god intends to actually take the virus off the earth maybe he'll put it with the other ones who were running away i don't know i just know this i know what god's plans are he hasn't changed them and unless he tells me differently i am not changing my stand i will be right here releasing justice releasing the host of heaven and by the way yesterday released 50 billion of the host of heaven and if you did not know this god calls florida over the skies of florida he calls it his battle station on earth what does that mean that means their billions of the hosts posted there to be sent out on assignment and he had me send 50 billion yes people he has a lot no one knows but him you haven't counted them you probably haven't even seen them you'd probably be hiding if you had the host of heaven are not beautiful pretty boys with blonde hair and harps they have weapons coming out of them the frequency of god the fire of god they fight with lightning bolts and guess what some of the ones who've been assigned now are the same ones who fought in the flesh on behalf of israel go back and read it in the bible how one angel took up so many hundreds of thousands that shocked them all we have some of those fighting with us i enjoy commanding the host of heaven and they enjoy going on assignments they need orders from headquarters and let me tell you headquarters in heaven is very excited about these days i know you've heard several times different people sending things around i'm sure some of it's conspiracy stuff some of it's just being made up to make you feel better some of it's actually the real thing you should decide on what you think it is i just say this get plenty of supplies including cake and maybe for a couple weeks or so just to save you a trip to the grocery store this is not a time for death and destruction for us this is not a time for civil war in a civil war you have to have a divided nation we have a pocket of people who'd rather have communism here i said it the rest of us almost 80 million of us that's the majority in case you can't count we want life liberty freedom justice and righteousness in this nation and we are going to get it if god can save a world when eight people are praying how much do you think he can do with millions of people praying for this nation for its destiny and also the impact that will have around this world there are millions and millions of people praying and agreeing with you what you shouldn't do is begin to bash one another you're speaking the enemy's words i'll bash evil all day long then i'm gonna bash the ones he made god sends people to this earth they're already anointed they're already appointed i happen to be just one of those but i will not lose my stand and i will not back up because these are powerful days if people say what's going on their powerful days and when the hand of you god is about to move for you yes you can sit and eat cake and watch you've prayed you've read your word you've laid on your face you've cried out to god guess what he heard you he's not going to ignore your words when they line up with his when your words line up with his they create something that no man and no devil can stop so this is what we have to say go host make toast i can tell you that they were released 50 billion the other day today 10 more billion god had me release two key points in this country and key points around the world to be ready what can they do they can expose things they can speak to people and change the way that they're thinking they can say things of god to their spirit just like the devil says to yours if you're hearing it's all over let's just give it up you're hearing the wrong voice the shaking has surely begun that god spoke up on november the 4th when he said when the ground begins to shake get ready for the great exposure the landslide of exposure that will happen he's not changing who he has chosen to keep in the white house and it doesn't matter to me when god finishes what he's going to start i am celebrating with him he took me forward in time again today and showed me people running into the streets in america laughing they forgot if they didn't like someone of another color nobody cared they were so happy and joyful they were grabbing they were hugging each other without masks people nobody cared because freedom and liberty had come to this country and then he took me and showed me different places around the world when this landslide is done they were running into the streets they were grabbing one another laughing they were dancing they were celebrating that is your future so don't give up don't step back and don't take any fear the only ones who should be afraid are the ones who committed crime i'll tell you who is afraid hell i've seen demons quaking everywhere they're terrified of what is about to happen they know what's going on they know the hosts have been loosed on this earth they know what they've even been assigned to they're running so why not sit down get your popcorn and enjoy the show because it's going to be great people one day will make a movie of all this and people will roar and laugh and clap at the end that's what you should be doing and jen has a report to give a very short report about what god said on november the 4th when the ground begins to shake get ready for the landslide to happen so she's going to come and share with you all just a couple of earthquakes that have taken place uh over the over the last couple days and especially the one that happened on the fourth there you go john come here i'll just stand over here okay go ahead and say it loud then so um there were quite a lot of things that happened especially on the fourth i pulled up an article and i'm trying to find it yeah it's the world earthquake report for monday january 4th 2021 and it said that there were 10. 24th of november january 14th january the 4th okay yeah and it says um 10 of the largest earthquakes in the world happened and it just lists all the different ones and then the ones that were felt were places like croatia and um let's see there was a couple in croatia there was one in south dakota there was new zealand and puerto rico and if you just go and just you can literally see every day from from on this website including and then when she was talking about when she sent the host out um yesterday how many did you send out 50 billion 50 billion you'd hear that well it it's crazy because i pulled up an article this morning when i opened up the internet and it the first thing it said was south florida residents report shaking no official reports of earthquake or explosions and it happened in areas like ballard county miami-dade monroe counties also in um coral i think it's coral coral springs and just various people were reporting that their house started shaking this dad was working with his son doing virtual school when their chairs started to shake and then um the rest of the family came running the room asking what was that because he thought am i imagining this they went outside to see if it was like a big truck there was no big truck they've checked all the size were seismographs the um geographical whatever people that check for for earthquakes they there's no reports nothing none of the graphs moves none of the things and then they said well maybe because there's a lot of military that maybe they were testing the jets because when they they do the sonic boom but they they so they contacted the military bases in the area and they said no we did all our jet testing on thursday nothing was done on friday so at the very end of the article it says the official cause of the shaking and rumbling is not yet known yeah because you can't see the host leave so but you can sure hear them so i did share the article in the link but um there has been a tremendous amount of activity like i even uh googled earthquake um january 12th there was a magnitude 2.9 earthquake in utah um and then that does not mean god will destroy with earthquakes that's letting you know something is happening yeah and if you even do earthquakes for today you just google earthquakes for today it literally shows you a list of all of the ones that happened today uh do they have one here today um in the u.s um let's see i think it was indonesia earthquakes today here we go uh there was uh 5.5 in iran a 5.5 in afghanistan i understand that completely a 5.9 in guatemala a 4.0 in hawaii and this one really when i told you this one there was a 3.6 in conrad california which is smack in the middle between sacramento and san francisco wow and what did you say about san francisco yeah they just put a notice out that they were banning trump from any kind of broadcast or saying anything whatsoever from san francisco in their area in their frequencies and that's exactly where that earthquake happened i think god is saying he's not happy about that so this is just a little heads up to encourage you to let you know that shaking has definitely begun and no one can turn that back nobody can turn back time nobody can stop god from what he wants to do i just want to encourage you all really seriously keep celebration in your heart again god spoke to me and he said don't get off the path i put you on keep encouraging them to celebrate like freedom has already come because it will so we want to remind you whether they're still up tomorrow or not whether anything is taken down i'm talking about the actual social media is taken down as the networks are taken down if all that is taken down you have to remember this god has not changed his mind and do not let fear interfere in your life i'm not going to and i will still be here when it's all done i do need to let you know that i've become so popular with the criminals and criminal activity that they have another fake cat curb it's called decatur facebook page and again they're using the same plot they're trying to trap people into joining and signing up to win a thousand dollars that is not me yes i know that's my face they swiped one of my videos off of my page and used it to prove to you that that was really me i'm letting you know it's not me it is not me i think it's like it's got v then it's got like um a hyphen and then it has cat cur on there it has my picture if you see me in my studio sitting next to my uh portrait of the peacock and that's the picture they've used that's a fake one go on there and tell them i'm not falling for it you're a fake you know let them know that you're not happy about that whatever you do do not sign up to receive anything there is no money they want to steal your personal identification i do not do things like that i bring you revelation from heaven i'll let you know what's going on around the world what god is saying from heaven but i'm not going to do any kind of crazy things like that so don't fall for it because people actually are that's that's my picture but that that is not my facebook page and once again i want to remind people that cat does not know how to send private messages so she will never send a friend request a private message and she doesn't tag people i don't even know what a tag is a dog tag i don't know she doesn't tag people in comments on her post saying you've won money so please just report the people don't click on any links to see if you won money because report that they cannot cash fake it's not me okay they're using my stuff to get to people they already did it once before and now they're they started a whole new page and you know everybody knows people can share stuff from anybody's pages but when they use it for criminal activity they should be stopped and brought to justice at any case let them know you're not falling for it you know they're fake you know it's a lie and then report them please again it would be have a picture of me sitting on the sofa next to my uh beautiful uh artwork that somebody gave me i held it up so they could see it yes you saw it okay if you see that picture it's a fake here i am right here in my studio i'm alive okay just watch for anything that looks like i'm asking you for money or i'm having prizes to give away that's not going to happen or if i if you give me money i'll give you a personal word yeah i don't do that either you can't pay for words people god has something to say he'll make sure you get it i bring corporate words to the body of christ and even words to the government even words to this world but i'm not going to do that so i care about you so we want to let you know what's going on and i should be back hopefully tomorrow maybe if we're still up then we will be here and i want to encourage all of you thank you guardians for helping to guard the treasure god gave me the revelation you gave me i so appreciate guess what your gifts are arriving we'll be sending them out we're waiting on one more thing to come and we're going to send them out to you but you are precious to my heart i'm so grateful for all of you who support me who who pray for me especially who declare but the best way you can thank me is by taking the revelation and you live it yourself that makes you dangerous against hell and i appreciate all that you say and do on my behalf and on behalf of heaven this is because of father speaking he wants it clear he is not giving his country away he's already touched it and laid his hand on it and you will see the results very soon go host make toast go justice [Music] we will see you later

i do need uh pastors both to come up here i have some mantles to give out both of you if i go there's going to be mantles and he doesn't do you know i can't just say it i have to do it that's the way it is with me so um yeah god has highly honored you and who wouldn't right i mean even a little bit of time i've known you you're passionate you show people and you're hungry and you are so determined and fierce those are the kind of people god needs to do things for him those who want to be quiet and are you know i i hid in the i didn't hide he had me hidden for years but now of course with pink hair you can't hide so be glad he didn't ask you to have it he was going to make sure i couldn't hide and i was known by 40 pastors in our city i did all kinds of things for them my dad did we just love people we didn't care who you were we loved you about we were fierce against the darkness and you are totally fierce against the darkness and i absolutely love the name of your church because i have friends who are some of the hosts and uh you may think that is strange don't think it's strange angels appeared all over the new in the old testament and actually came and ate with uh you know some of the greats of that day but you don't worship them okay it doesn't actually say you can't talk to them if someone if one gives comes to give you a word from god make sure you by the way i have to add this in there always test the spirits there are groups out there teaching you to you know send yourself somewhere and do all kinds of things but you have to test and if an angel appears to you and says come with me you better ask them are you of the spirit of the most high god who sent his son to die for the sins of this world because if they're not they will disappear and they can't answer wrong with that i've done that since i was real little i always would test them even though i go to heaven all the time and i'm around angels all the time they live over my home in my home and if something appears to me though i will still ask them that there is a safety measure that needs to be taught because more and more pastors will find out we are connected in the spirit realm with heaven that's where our rulership is we don't rule over people we rule over all the darkness trying to control people and some some of those beings those demons can appear as angels of light and stuff like that i mean they can they can be very convincing like the left is trying to be right now but anyway just test the spirit so don't reject something i want god wants okay he wants you to know him he wants to know all about him he wants you to understand who you are why he sent you in this particular time on the earth this is a powerful time the divine decade but then also 24 years in the white house god will have total and then after that that 24 years prepares us for the next 100 years if you thought you were leaving you're not going anywhere so don't hide get your crown on roll up your rapture rug you can keep it for later or someone down the road someone generations from now might need that okay and i just need to say this for free the holy spirit say is free the rapture will not be a rescue party it will be a celebration of such glory and power it is a party say it's a party it's not a rescue party it's a party party so uh i i knew what was coming before you invited me because you know he told me and he said you're gonna give out mantels to them they both are going to get mantles for this new season and um that's why when he had me send that word through sunil he said bill bill bill he is serious about the broadcasting i believe you will have a network one day because you already taken authority in that whole system and the frequencies in the in the in the ways that come through to produce that you're already ruling in that and by the way the first thing he wants me to tell you is you have reached the level of king in the spirit realm and uh only god chooses who the kings the lords and the priests are those are spiritual levels of authority that's why he says you are kings and priests and to your god that's not just a title that is a position and i know the church doesn't always talk about that either but i understand it completely what that means so you reach the level of a king in the spirit realm you can't go any higher than that you're not god okay we're lower than him but in the spirit according to dominion and authority a king is as high as you can get and it comes because you fell in love with jesus first you can't skip jesus okay we can't skip the word of god you can't just elevate yourself somewhere i know people have put themselves in the five-fold ministry that never belong there and they can get away with that but you can't get away with saying you're a king because when you declare a decree nothing will happen if you're not but the kings actually have very high rulership and any king even in the natural realm you have an army so does the king in the spirit realm and this day i didn't just come by myself i came with millions of the army of heaven that i i command them get used to that word say we command because he commands god said here you're going to get some revelation on the scripture now when god said command ye me he wasn't saying you tell me what to do he was saying me i want to see you command yes command you me me i want to see you command and that's what he meant we have authority and dominion jesus said i give you power over all the power of the enemy not some of it some of the time all of it all the time but when you rule and take authority over it you're ruling and so the greater you get in those levels of authority you increase in many ways and so we may have had angels helping us in the past but since 2014 a scroll was opened in heaven that had the words on host initiative okay it's that host initiative that's what i'm wearing right here this is their logo they have a logo and it represents the army of heaven working with us but we are not we are over angels right in authority the angels are not over us do you understand that it says in the ages to come we will judge them is that right that means we have seniority because we are we came from the heart of god he made them by speaking but we were birthed from him and so because you've reached that level of king he has sent with me one million of the hosts of heaven that are being positioned here i brought my staff i didn't bring it here with me but i brought my staff to decree for them to be here and so they're actually outside this building right now one million that you will command you will send them you'll give them orders to go and do things in the spirit realm pull down strongholds that you see evil or where wherever evil and wickedness is going on and i mean for instance i take power over all the part of the enemy trying to cheat lie and steal and hide and cover up so i command the host of heaven to go uncover all that that's being hidden no matter where it is how long it's been there or what it is you will go now in jesus name and uncover all of that pull down the strongholds of satan that are helping them empowering them inspiring put down those strongholds that they no longer can assist them in any weightless ever shred platforms the evil high levels of evil and spirit realm are operating in over our country over all the stuff we command the host of heaven now you go and shred those platforms when you do that fear begins to fall on the humans doing the wickedness as long as satan is working with them empowering them and inspiring them they feel bold they feel like they own it but when that is removed they no longer have that this is how you rule the spirit realm that's taking power over all the power of the enemy i'm not controlling people but i'm totally telling through the host of heaven they were made to war for us you don't want the spirit roman battle anything right we are more than conquerors they are a weapon for us weapons are not natural they are spiritual right they are mighty say they it didn't say it in the bible they are mighty to the pulling down the strongholds and one of the ones those weapons is the army of heaven and we get to command them if you're not playing games in the darkness they hearken unto the word of the lord in you so what you say if it doesn't sound like the lord or if you're out there blasting people crushing and hurting people with your mouth or your spouse or whatever you're doing that's not godly they don't have to listen to you so there are requirements okay you've got to have accountability if you have an authority like that you have to god knows he can trust you he trusts them that's what he said to me so this day you are being right now your army outside right now you need to say i choose to invite heaven's army to be my weapon to fight against the darkness i receive them right now [Music] and i i have i have two mantles that came out up here uh this one actually belongs to both of you but this one is just for you [Laughter] i'm going to give brenda hers first isn't it beautiful and so is she to him so chief you're beautiful to the lord and so he wants to bless you with his mantle and it's got many pieces in this mantle it's all the things you'll get to do that you desire to do because you have been willing to do those things that aren't the best that aren't always comfortable there are always uh uh that that maybe other people would not want to do you've been willing to say yes to love people for him to support your husband to love your husband i would say love your husband love your husband you've been willing so he is giving you this is actually a mantle of beauty beauty from heaven and you will get great reward do this so this is yours in this day and i can tell you that we are seated in heavenly places because he takes a layer of our soul that looks just like you the layers in your soul are images of you those are your emotions when you give yourself to jesus christ he has the right to take that and he seats it with him in heavenly places so you are really seated it's not just something suggested it's not symbolic there is a layer of view in heaven looks just like you and at this moment he just put that mantle upon you it is a mantle of greatness greatness love and beauty and so there you go get ready for great things to happen and fun things to happen okay amen and i know this is another mantle [Music] this is a mantle of presidential favor and even though it has trump's name he is president he will sit as president for four more years no matter what anyone else says that is god's plan so he's putting on you not just for this president but for many presidents to come you will have favor from god and they will have your ear to hear god and your hand in friendship so this is a mantle right now of governmental authority presidential favor that's what he called a presidential favor and that includes you and your wife but he wanted me to place it on you as a head come here you just get underneath there too there you go so father right now i i establish and set upon your children the mantle of presidential favor which means they already have favor without measure with you they will have facial favor without measure with the presidents with president trump and with other presidents coming and so long as you have them hear god they will carry and operate in this mantle and they will find out very quickly that is going to begin soon so receive it in jesus name and i bless them god and i thank you for the army of heaven that's been assigned to them father that it will continue to grow the more you send them the more you get them i thank you father in jesus name so be it yes and i have one more gift for you this is a sign of my personal friendship with you i have one i got one for you the same so thank you for being my sister [Music] god bless you god bless you there you go wear it well amen now when i came i already posted a thousand of the hosts of heaven from my own the army that he gave me to command i lost number i don't even know how many there are and we can actually do that today for whoever wants to you have to invite i know this protocol for heaven did you not invite christ into your life is that right i hope you say yes you invite it's the way heaven is you invite christ to come into your life you must invite holy spirit to indwell you is that correct you have to invite heaven to be a weapon for you no they were created for that the army of heaven was never ever designed to protect heaven they don't need it and actually they didn't even get to throw lucifer out and one-third of the angels they didn't get to throw them out they wanted to trust me i don't know what all these people think about this whole thing going on they said there was sadness in heaven they were weeping they were rejoicing they threw a party when they were kicked out god does have a government in heaven and he has a way that he operates that he doesn't abide evil it gets unseated it gets kicked out and that actually did happen in heaven one day and so those angels understand stuff that we're going through right now they understand what we're going through some people have lost family members over this whole thing they really have they've lost businesses and business partners and even churches have split people love churches because they're choosing the wrong thing the wrong thing right you cannot choose or partner with darkness and think you're not going to get some kind of a consequence of that you cannot side with those who want to take the life of people who have no love for anybody that always is a sign that the enemy is involved when life want to be taken or controlled or crushed uh god never put america here actually didn't put anyone here for that reason but america was made specifically by god for his own purposes in his plans his will his way that's why even here in america as we have fought so many times to keep our ability to be free but you don't have the right to hurt crush and bash people and i think the other half the left side doesn't even know what that means they have no lives matter actually is what they ought to be if you want to know the truth no lives matter to them no lives matter to them not even the people they're using matter to them they don't care this is the way the enemy is satan doesn't care who he uses he doesn't care who he destroys he doesn't care who gets stolen from and as i so today i am going to talk about america i can't help that that's god's biggest thing right now with me back in 2015 the beginning god caught me up to heaven and said um trump's going to win and he'll be in the white house for eight years because i need him there even though it might seem impossible it's going to happen he said i'm going to shift america onto my timeline and into righteousness and he said i even have inventions and things to be created that i will not allow to be created until i've dealt with the darkness that's in the government and great exposure to levels people never dreamed of this is still god speaking to me will happen he said it will be great some people will not understand it they'll think i've abandoned them i have not abandoned them i'm actually setting up their lives for the next 100 years [Applause] this country is a light to this world that light will get greater the body of christ will learn how to operate in authority and dominion and it will be so hard for anything like what we are experiencing to ever happen again not until the perilous time is coming nobody knows that day don't plan your life around when the perilous times are don't plan your life around the rapture you have way too much to do we're just beginning to understand the operations of the spirit roman even who we really are we are meant to be in authority in this earth we're not under anything if you belong to jesus christ he's not under anything either on earth as it is in heaven is what god has always desired and yes god does have a dream it is him and mankind operating together as one and so great days have to happen on this earth there has to be those days and everybody thinks well some people think i always get corrected but if i change what i just instantly said the holy spirit just tell me what to say some people think it's the end because things are so awful they're not awful okay i know they may be hard and inconvenient and i know yes people have been affected by this that was not god's plan but there is an enemy in this world and when he can find people who are wicked and evil to do his plan they're going to do it if they've already said yes to him they're going to do it and that can affect our life but in the future it will be much harder because of the discernment we'll be walking in the understanding of who we are living and taking authority uh practically almost everywhere in this world wherever the body of christ lives he actually is going to create regions of light in this country probably the first country because he calls this god called his gift to this world i know his son is but he means literally it is a gift for hope for a future where to find him how to know him how to live free free in order to live free you have to have justice you can't be free without justice so what is god doing today serving out justice [Applause] he said i could not allow trump just to win normally he won oh trust me he won he did win but he said i couldn't let him win the normal way because the darkness would have remained hidden what he's got planned for us is so great and the ability to do things and help people and even change things drastically for the better and the greater would be a better word to use for the greater of god's purposes in this country he had to deal with the darkness that's been hidden for years so he already had a plan it wasn't the scam democrat and it wasn't the pandemic which by the way has been lied about most of the time because god said they'll use anything they can to keep people away from each other keep their mouths muffled and not speak and say anything don't let them gather together because then they'll know truth because they'll be together it's they're too strong together so they came up with a lot of these plans amen [Applause] and all this that was going on god said i haven't changed my plan it's working and he said i will the only one i'll be the only one who gets the glory for all this but of course he wants the glory amen so he already knew this stuff would happen he knew it but we who are the body should always remain strong really strong if you represent christ in this world you represent heaven on earth we represent heaven on earth one day you'll go there if you die y'all stand at me what if you chose you to remain but if you're here for the millennial reign would you want that there will be some that will i'm not planning on dying he won't let me talk about dying he won't let me talk about retiring there is no retirement okay you don't retire in heaven you have a lot of fun and recreation and using your powerful gift that you love whether it's tennis or horseback riding or running a rodeo or a old antique car show or if you're a baker if you're in the theater it's all in heaven it's your gift he put it in you before he sent you here raise up a child in the way in the bent in the gift i gave them to be and they'll never depart from it that's actually what that scripture this revelation it's one of the first things he taught me he said parents that sit there all week long trying to figure out what their child's spiritual gift is is true we'll all sit here and figure out what what is my spiritual gift well in heaven you don't use your spiritual gift people that's why we all think we'll be bored it's the passion he put in you it's what he gave you that you're good at that you think about night and day if you could be paid to do it you do it your whole mansion is being designed around that gift if you were gonna have a rodeo you'd have thousands of horses you have all the property you have real supernatural places for people to come and be a part of that and the horse would be yelling you the whole time oh i'm bucking you [Laughter] it's heaven but right now he wants you here he needs you here he needs you to not just be he doesn't want you just to wake up he wants you to wake up stand up and stand out you need to stand out by the way you live your life the choices you make that you make your stain and you don't back down you do not let fear interfere in your life fear should have no part of you he has not given us a spirit of fear and i know a lot of people think well he didn't send you know spirits of fear no in your spirit man he never put fear that is something that comes from the enemy the enemy brings fear but god didn't give you a spirit of fear he didn't put fear in your spirit man it's not even in you he doesn't send you with it in you you should be free from that he wants you again you know who you are in christ when you become dangerous against hell they don't want to be around you they beg not to be assigned to you do because they know when they go back and they haven't fulfilled their assignment to get you dragged into the darkness they will be beaten satan doesn't reward anybody he does control with fear even in hell so his plan is for us all to be dangerous against then there's no way fear can get in you there's no place for it to even enter in you're so full of him so full of the authority he gave you and the knowledge of him and understanding and having revelation from him revelation on the word revelation is a lifestyle heaven culture isn't just a something it is a lifestyle then you are dangerous and every word that comes out of your mouth will be powerful because it's filled with love with life with hope he said always be ready with an answer yeah the issue is there but the answer is him so how well do you know him if you want to know him more you pursue it amen i was raised as a child one of fifteen i knew it wasn't about me when i was three why because there were others already in the household by the time i was eight i was a mini parent i didn't have anything given to me on a golden platter but i sure was watching those platters 60 loads of laundry a week 50 pounds of potato a week to peel and all those chiefs to watch over because none of them were indians okay none of them don't mean that in the wrong way they were leaders and they knew it that's why he had to give a sear into the household they couldn't get away with nothing i knew what they were doing if i was not even there i wasn't easy to live with i'm still not easy to live with we'll go place oh we need to pray about that okay don't go in there don't sit there cleanse it for the kingdom there are scum on it i don't sit anywhere without going i cleanse it for the kingdom let me never switch mics it's probably my electron whatever oh does it you having a there is an electro energy i can't remember how they tell me i can't wear a watch even in the natural is speeds it does something so god made me before he sent me he sent me as a seer that is god's right but there are people who have that gift that also can the enemy knows if you have that gift by your reactions and how you how you respond and say things about things but so since it was little i could see angels or demons i saw either one and by the time i was like 10 11 12. i knew how the enemy operated i could go tell people don't go there don't do that this is what happens in the spirit when you do that you don't want that to you know and they look at me like i was wild i didn't care he also gave me an attitude of i don't care i don't care what you think it doesn't bother me i am not afraid of the face of man i've seen the face of god and by the way yes you can see the face of god if you receive jesus christ as your savior you think you're going to get holier when you get there you think you have to have a special pass when you die to get into the throne room to see him say no you've been washing the blood of the lamb your name is written in the lamb's book of life he is building your mansion i do love it that he used john the beloved the one who jesus loved i i just john was a showman he really was he was the son of thunder what do you think yeah him and his brother used to fight over pretty girls in the beginning of jesus ministry one day god the father took me back and showed me a day in the life of christ when he was just starting a minister and he had the the rabble i'm talking about the disciples the ones who were with him right and they had left people and they left things that they were doing and luke had patience running down the street asking him why did you leave us for him this is this is a this is him going into minister christ and all these people they were throwing stones at the tax collector because the tax culturals didn't usually go out and mingle they stayed in their little shop okay and you come in paid but when cuz because he was out there he was a target so here's them they're ducking from the stones for him listening to the patients yelling at luke why did you leave him for us and then there's james and john fighting along the side of the road over two pretty girls this is jesus a mighty man sent by god to share the good news and this is who's walking with him and there's the other one with his hand in the money bag all the time and the father said i didn't make it easy for him either because i also am the ce ceo of one quest international i actually do have a position i have a corporation it's called one quest for one god to create heaven on earth to reveal and create heaven on earth and so i do have uh i worked in the business world for 25 years and i loved it then god said okay i'm taking you out of your cushy job i'm taking you out and then i'm going to take your husband out a year later so you're really going to have to love me and believe me we slept on people's floors for a while i still celebrated i didn't change who i was i worshiped i gave i served the whole time we were sleeping on people's floors and people thought we were crazy and my daughter spent their birth each had a birthday sleeping on somebody's floor we ate whatever was there put everything we had in the storage and just trusted god at the end of one year somebody walks up with keys to a million dollar condo at pond division beach and said here you go just stay here long as you want didn't cost us a penny or a dime because we did not change who we were even in the midst of something that people would say it was a disaster my own daughters called it an adventure they belong to me okay we had adventures we never had disasters we never had a crisis it was an adventure you have to live like that so people see you if they don't understand oh no i love him more than anyone else i'm in his hand not some other somebody of the person's hand i trusted him it's a way of life and then i said yes every time he wanted something every time he required something to me i never said never said no to him i'll be almost 70. i forget how old i am it doesn't matter i'm getting younger because i'm claiming timeless you tell me that one day do you want to old do you want to get old well not particularly well then do you want to be timeless i said yes he said whatsoever you say you don't doubt in your heart but believe that it will come to pass you'll have whatever you say so i'm timeless and i have pink hair and god asked me to have the pink hair that really gets some pastors not the black ones oh no girl they like this there's a white woman who preaches and she has a pink hair we gotta have her come that's not what the white one said you are too over threads you have fallen off the edge god would never do that no we can't do that to the people and say your people come to my meetings they will find some way to find me because they want revelation about heaven about god about who they are they're hungry you need to take it up a notch in your church [Applause] it is very true i have like what fifteen thousand black friends i do and they won't let me leave they make me they make me speak four or five hours they don't care if people miss dinner if they miss lunch they don't they don't even care they reset the clock i don't know how many times i went to this one church i went to this really nice church i was invited i went to help rescue this little woman pastor she was gonna get out of the ministry because she was being beat up by other pastors saying she didn't belong there and so i went to this little tiny place outside of washington dc and after three days she was ready to never quit and this other the other they found out about me so they come so i stayed in like this little hotel that had cracks under the door that you know you stuff things underneath it hoping nothing to crawl in that's where i had to stay when i was there and then the other one said oh we found out you're in the area we're going to let you minister and they sent limos and they put me in the wealthiest hotel in washington dc and they had a congregation of 5000 people and i had given all my money to this other little pastor to help her and um and god said he he gets so blessed that my heart is to love that was my my earthly dad heart was to whatever i get i'm giving away that's why i have margaret margaret was created to make money and keep it i was created to give it away so he had to put us both together she's my sister-in-law by the way and she married my brother that took enough bravery right there you ever heard me talk about rj there's margaret she's r.j's wife his solution to all this would just be to kill all the bad people send him to hell then we'll have a nice nice time to that with my brother don't ask him to counsel you if you are in sin he will seriously say that i'll get my gun and we'll deal with it and as you're dying over hell maybe you'll change your mind he really gets invitations from black pastors you're a man you come into my church you didn't know you never know what you're gonna get when i speak okay my life was not very normal but rj is my brother he's my older brother and so he got into all kinds of things he'd he would always ask me because you know he'd say i'm i'm braver than you so you won't do this i i did not not like send dangerous things or dumb things but like you won't stick your finger in this tube because i will and you won't and i did and then the fire pit department had to come cut it off those kind of things were seven eight and nine years old so i went through this whole testing time when my brother too finally went you know i'm not dumb anymore i'm not doing it but r.j usually if there's a killing going on they'll be he'll be there before the police they'll find or he'll find the villain for the police board and he also was in the uh in the military also but he's always been so fierce about un injustice he's friends with all of our police department all of our fire department the military and he's about my size and he's not afraid of anything hell's angels invite him into their to do funerals for them because they'd rather get rid of you to look at you but they know he's a godly man and he's he he's a biker he creates hearties and stuff like that so he's not normal he'll minister to people in nursing homes we're about to go to heaven if you're wicked that person he'll send you either there to the other place and i grew up with him was enough to humble anybody trust me so we have all kinds of a mix in my family then we have all the adopted ones like really adopted and so my dad was creative so we always had fun things to do exciting things to do at home feed the 200 pets we could do a funeral for a pet at the drop of a hat i guess god thought maybe one day we'd actually do real ones i wouldn't do a normal one we'd have cake lined up by the casket they'd have it in heaven right we would have to have music we'd have to have dancing and we'd have to have cake if you want to do it the way they do it in heaven that's how they do it in heaven you go up there you're having a celebration party they have lots of cake everybody dances in the throne and the father greets you he gives you rewards you get to go see your amazing mansion and the whole time we're down here mourning and grieving upset we didn't have enough money to spend on them when they don't need it anymore get cremated it's cheaper the holy spirit told me to say that one time tell me to get cremated it's okay we can put the ashes back together that that's what the holy spirit said so there's a holy spirit quote right there straight from heaven we know where the ashes are okay you can't get clean what if you died in a fire and burn up you don't get your body you're going to get that body back people you better be happy about it it'll look amazing in the bible it says you will be known as you are known you can't be someone else and he doesn't want you to be someone else right now don't let people influence you to be somebody you're not he wanted me up here he picked me out of all the tribe of my family i'm happy that he did and i'm happy he put me in america and i'm happy that our country represents and stands for god one nation under god and and the father would talk to me all the time ever since the elections right before the elections the first time he said i'm going to throw you out there so far you'll never be able to go back like go back where i knew the the media would all act up and you are so right he keeps telling me that they'll lose their many of them are going to lose their networks just so you know that right now and other networks will rise up that will tell the truth amen and they'll give us the true news the right not the hidden the stuff you know not not hiding things but letting us know i travel overseas a lot and during this whole first election that they had i got talked to i mean strangers come up to me and go you must be an american it must be the pink hair and we want to know what you think about your president oh we in america love our president don't watch the fake news whatever you do because they won't tell you the truth about anything and this is even like three years into his term and they went you know what they still they have a problem they can't let go of what they first started with which is the bashing and the accusing they said they don't actually give the news you find out almost nothing about what's important you keep hearing it's like they put it on repeat all the time they're just doing the same thing you know why they've convinced their own soul that stuff is true and when you get in your soul you'll choose again what you choose to do or say you'll choose it again that's what happens that's why people who listen to it have changed people who are nice and kind now are not because they've compromised their soul and so the more people go and say oh no you need to listen to what they're saying they're talking what's right i'm talking about the what the people are saying that haven't made any decisions and there's still some who don't want anybody because they don't like anything they're hearing you choose life you always choose life no matter who you vote for you choose life amen god said this day i offer you life and death what does he say and so they've been hiding so actually their whole mess has gotten worse i'm talking about the news media still out there it's important to know what's going on right we need to know news good news correct news unbiased news and he's going to raise up several people i know for sure several christians that will have their own and first class first-rate network it's nice to have a show it's nice to have a show somewhere but he wants a network that can replace the false networks that are out there and i can tell you right now there is great fear in the camp of the left and there's great fear they may not say it but they're great they're terribly they're awfully afraid some are already hiding they're afraid in the news media they're afraid you may see some people shortly leave their leave leave that to get out before they're taken to prison you cannot commit a federal crime and not go to prison a lot of people in the post office that were paid to change ballots add ballots steal ballots and and that's why i always tell people don't mail it in i always said never mail it in don't mail it in it's too easy for people to take and i know there's two point some million votes that were actually taken away uh and even then you know our president still he still won even that and there were created new ballasts that were fed into the thing when they were supposed to stop counting and close down they weren't and i was watching kenneth copeland also that night i was seeing you and he said okay we're just going to go for the evening and then they announced we're going to stop counting the ballots and the holy spirit said yes that's so they can feed all the false ones in he said this is when they're going to do that this is the holy spirit saying they're going to do the big switch this is on the 3rd of november and they're going to they're going to do corruption and fraud they're going to create brand new ballots and replace the ones that they've even harvested people's names off of ballots and change those ballasts and then put those into the electoral machines that's what they did they caught people in illinois that were throwing trump's ballots by the bins into the river they were up they were arrested in time because of course they were doing it but it was filmed and people saw and they threw them in the river the thing about crime if you're going to do if you're going to do a scam or whatever you want to call it if you're going to commit fraud on a large scale you don't have teams of thousands of people with you so you hire whoever's willing to do it but when you hire these small time criminals guess who's going to yell first they have no bond with those people we are bonded by our love for god and our love for our present we have a bond and the one thing they weren't counting on was that we weren't going to go along with their scam you can't convince people who know the truth to accept fraud you just can't convince them and i mean he had these rallies with forty thousand fifty thousand people in it and i've never seen any would buy these people so where did all these millions of votes come from that he had no people to vote for him i don't know why they don't think well i think they're dumb maybe i don't know they think we are but the one thing they didn't count on was the moral majority in this country the moral majority they don't want socialism they don't want their rights taken away they don't want to be controlled or hand-fed okay they don't want to become a third-world country they have families they have a future they want a destiny for their own children that's the moral majority and a lot of those are believers but some even aren't but they still want that kind of life they're not settling and they could put those million dollar ads on all day long the only ones watching them the ones who made them it isn't changing us and there are people who are blowing whistles even in higher places and they're very much afraid but they can't they can't lose face right now they got to keep their momentum not with us they got to keep their own momentum going for the lie they know they they know they stole it they know they cheated they know that they committed crimes but they can't cave in but there's a lot of ones under them that don't want to take the fall so on november the 4th god had said to me when the ground begins to shake and at this time they were still doing all the false stuff when the ground begins to shake you watch for the landslide the landslide that will go cover from the top to the bottom when a landslide starts it starts with a little shaking and as that momentum builds with that landslide it gets louder and louder and more and more is pulled into that landslide until the whole mountain has been uncovered and god said that will be the crime the corruption all of the stuff the lying the cheating the stealing it will all be made known and even though they won't want to report it can you get over that they won't want to report it they cannot stop president trump from being announced as the president amen he said it will start it will start with one phone call and after that one call is made and known everyone else will be getting in line to rat on that whole group and even though it's happening they well they're it's like i think they're in the fantasy they think if they keep waiting long enough they'll convince us to change our minds and just drop the whole thing now we're not giving our life away we're not giving our destiny away we're not selling our family down the river we are here for the purpose that god put us here for and we are not to be controlled amen and i don't know how long it take to get into their heads the other thing legally in the natural you can't call the presidency until all the votes are counted and i don't know if you know this they're now recounting new york they're even recounting the recounting they're going to get to the thing where they can recount all the states they think that need to be recounted they can't call the election there has been nobody called who has become president the media is just making it up hoping we'll believe it i'm not believing that that's not god's plan and that is not what will happen we don't have to settle in our lives right millions of people i want you know this have prayed around the world who aren't even americans [Applause] because they don't want america to become a third-world country we stand for justice liberty and freedom and we help many other countries and have and still will they don't want to see us they don't want to see us fail and even they don't believe the lie and they don't even live here just with statistics and proof it's called proof people even with the proof that all these millions of people are following and supporting trump they still had a plan they already planned this they had this plan before he even started running again they knew how they would steal it they knew that they could do it they knew there was a way to do it they knew they could pull it off they knew if the media would be on their side that that's all what everybody would believe but they didn't and so i wanna i wanna encourage people don't talk about losing you don't talk about losing when god is still working his plan why we have already won we have already won we won because we voted we won because we prayed we won because it was god's plan and all that is needed in the natural realm has already happened for president trump to keep his seat amen and and god a god god who knows everything of course he told me because i'll just be walking around all of a sudden he'll just start talking to me when i say god i mean the father yes i hear jesus all the time people find the craziest things to say about you one thing you don't even know jesus you don't mention him oh yes he is my first love and i talk about him all the time you must not be listening to the right videos i have nothing without him i am nothing without him i'd have no future i would have nothing but i do have him and i know him well i know what happened to him on the cross i know what happened to him in the garden i know what happened to him in hell i know what happened to him when he went back to heaven and poured out his blood on the mercy seat i know what was happening in hell when he was pouring his blood out in the mercy seat the loser was in hell groveling in the dirt of hell stripped of all his gemstones broken and beaten by the son of god and no longer had the keys to hell death and the grave so he took his beauty and he took his authority away from him that gave us absolutely the right to operate in authority in this world satan is a false king he's not even a king he's a false prince a false one who never was given authority or the right to do anything he took what he wanted and used it while he can and that side no matter what name you give them that does the same thing as all the same thing is always what satan wants he wants it his own way he wants people to worship him he wants him to only exist with him and that's what happens no matter what you put name or tag you put on that that is satan's plan is to kill steal and destroy every person and everything that's why he is afraid of america satan hates america because it causes them more problems than any other country because we preach the gospel from here we train people and send them with the gospel we go over there and help people learn how to give the gospel we feed people everywhere we're doing kind acts we care about people we rescue people for him if you were the enemy you wouldn't want any of that so what is your plan i'm going to take over i will deceive them this thing's going to stop i can't take it anymore it's not working with my plan i'm going to take over this country i'm taking it for myself there's enough wicked people here i can already get to use to do that but what he didn't count on was we have the truth living in us it's not something we hear is something that lives with us and the one who brings the truth lives in us why would he think we would believe a lie [Applause] you need help if you want to believe a lie we'll have deliverance right now you walk in the truth you live the truth you breathe it you speak it he came to set us free [Applause] justice is on one of the steps of his throne huge words justice yes he wants justice yes he wants accountability yes he wants people to pay for the things they have done wrong but those who are at the top that lead others into it are in even more trouble with god when you deceive others to join you and twist the truth and ruin their future and ruin their destiny and so many have been brought into that place right now and i always encourage them if you're listening go tell the truth while you still can go repent and they'll cur turn them in tell the truth about the crimes that were committed and i have sent the host on a daily basis to encourage people who committed those crimes to tell the truth do it now while you can don't wait till it's too late you'll go to prison you know satan tells people things all the time do you know the spirit of god does too he can speak to people to inspire them to encourage them and heaven wants us to remain free because he has god has a plan i'm telling you for 24 years in the white house he's not willing to tell trump oh you can wait four years and then i'll put you in then can you imagine the one who made everything holds the air you breathe no has been from the beginning then they've been could you ever see him oh i guess i'll have to change my plan we don't understand his ways but we need to everything that's happening is to set us up for the next 100 years the inventions that are waiting they're just beyond your imagination that god's gonna send to this earth to help people and make their life better cancer will be here no more i really believe they already have a cure they just don't want you to know it there'll come a time as this administration trumps administration and then pence is after that for eight years and then i i live prophecy i live it and he doesn't just show me a few years i clearly know what will happen for the next 50 years clearly have seen it and been there god's not changing his mind in his master plan for america he needs who he chose in that office when he chose him to be there and he is not willing to let the enemy have those times some of the greatest leaders in the body of christ are still being born who is throwing mountains into the sea who's walking on air are raising the dead that were cremated who's stopping an earthquake and make it go back the way it was before it came including the dead being raised and the buildings going back together that's the greater works why would he all of a sudden decide i just don't want this his son died so he could have that happen the death of his son and resurrection of his son was so these things could happen in this world that he created so they could happen and people would know there is a god he told me he was erasing the gray area that existed in america what's the gray area the one saying there is no god that is getting smaller and smaller there come a point where people know i'm either in the darkness or i'm in the light there's there's no hiding there's no wondering you know who people believe and what they live they'll either live in regions of darkness and it will be legal and they'll be living in regions of light the great light the greater light regions and cities sometimes more than one city and people will drive their dead family members in there and they'll come to life that's how powerful the presence of god will be the authority of the believer will be great in these regions of light sickness can't abide no crime i saw demons flee like dust out of these cities to get out because it was painful for them the annoying king that was put in you when you were born again is painful to the enemy what anointing the anointing that breaks the yoke you have it first john 2 27 there's a scripture for all you who want that it's in the bible i have a little cd i made and we made it in this very old church because the pastor thomas he gave himself up and ran from a denominational church they tried to steal his church in mississippi in the heart of mississippi in this little tiny town it says little town where big things happen and it's one little pastor stood up to all the other religious people trying to shut him up and didn't want him speaking about certain things and so finally they said in in two weeks you'll be out of here and he stood up in the church and he was the pastor and he said okay i'm leaving now whoever would like to follow me and have life and have holy spirit just come they all left with him i think he had four elders left and he started this church it was never got really huge but man the impact it had on that whole little town and he found out about me i think i went to his place like eight times in like two years and they ended up by getting people together and they trained them and trained them in the host and they ran witchcraft out of town they ran it out i mean you talk about manifestations they they had them everybody was afraid of the witches and uh god said when you go this time witchcraft will be run out they will run it out and when we were leaving down when margaret and i were leaving we had pictures in the sky of a witch leaving town leaving town those people are so determined we want to be free from the effect and the control witchcraft is not a joke don't watch it don't watch it don't read it it's all about controlling people that's what they're for it's not a joke one of the things coming one day because you know whenever god does some great things the enemy brings in a counterfeit right well people will begin to know okay well i can't believe this lie anymore it's too obvious that god is here it's going to get more and more obvious that there is a god his name is jesus christ and so it will be hard for the devil to come up with new things but one of the things he will have at that time will be good witchcraft because all the movies are preparing people for him oh in front of people they'll raise the dead and heal the sick and say you can still be a witch see this thing is coming we have to be powerful we have to be strong we have to be fierce we have to understand uh it says in all your getting of wisdom get understanding that is knowledge of the holy one and how he operates that's why these days have to come they have to have manifestations of the power and the passion and the plans of the living god because that is the one thing we can come against it with because there will be a lot of impressionable people think oh this is a good thing they have not one ounce of discernment in their being because they've been fed it by movies and books oh there are good witches they're against the bad ones there are no good witches and they've been around for a long time and the bible says have nothing to do with a necromancer go look it up there were never any good ones in the old testament there were never any good ones in the new testament and there are no good ones now don't consult a medium or a psychic you're getting this for free don't consult them if you did lose it from your song repent for it they don't work for god he's fivefold ministry his prophets or prophetic people anyone can prophesy make sure you're accountable in your life and your actions right and you know how you get more you step out and do it you step out god gives you word if he's like you're going to explode and burn inside you need to say that you're also not accountable for forcing that person to do it i'll save you some grief if you deliver a word from god it's not your job to make them do it you're going to start a whole different war you deliver it let the holy spirit work on them not your job and the hardest people to prophesy to are your family my family still wants to know what's for dinner when laundry's gonna be done even though they have they have all this revelation he knows how to keep you humble give your family [Laughter] and even if i go too long let me know i just gotta talk about jesus bless the lord jesus christ and all that he's done more than any of us all put together he's been through it all he really has the hardest part was the garden not the cross he died before he got there he died to the father's will if it be possible let this cup pass from me because what was in the cup wasn't in him it wasn't anything he ever would do or want to do but what had to be nailed to the cross was what was in the cup that's the only person who can forgive our sins is him he's the only one that drank all that sin in and nailed it to the cross no one else can say they can forgive sins no other religion no other god none of them in the garden was the most important thing he did when he said but not my will let your will be done and two angels were sent from heaven i got to talk about this cup when jesus when he was on the earth and it would say even when he had his disciples especially after he got the disciples he'd go away to the mountain to be with his father he'd go see him he'd meet him and talk to him and he went there and he took him a cup god his father made him a carpenter he put business in his son so he would have a door to speak to anybody anywhere that's why he likes business people you get more invitations if your business right and so i also opened a door for him to talk with sinners all the time they wanted him to do he was a master carpenter not just a finish not just a little finish she was a master carpenter joseph was a master carpenter so he made on purpose for his father he made this cup it wasn't really beautiful it was wood of course very perfect mastery the way he made it in the handle was beautiful and so he met with him and gave it to him this is about his um second year into his ministry so when the father had to choose he already knew this would all happen he had to choose a cup to put all that in and he knew his son would have to drink it or the plan wouldn't work the plan was to for him to die for our sins that we might be free that we would have a way back to the father so the father got that cup and he put all that stuff in it he chose two angels from a gabriel's group because gabriel angels look more like humans with wings most of the army look like creatures i mean some have eight eyes some have weapons coming out of them they're an army so he picked two of gabriel's that already the lord knew who these angels were he knew them he knew them when he was in heaven and they brought that cup to him and they were in the garden the whole time and ministered to him while he was having to drink this cup but as part of their reward god does reward as part of the reward for willing to do that it would be very hard because they couldn't come against anybody there who was coming to take him the army actually probably had the hardest time because he was the lord of hosts the army of heaven he was over all the armies of heaven christ was and and they loved him and so it was probably very hard they were all told in heaven this was going to happen they knew it so they didn't come down and beat up people or rip up the people that were going to try to crucify him i'm sure they wanted to do that because to defend to protect him would have been their number one thing when christ came and was sent down to earth and made into a little seed and planted in the womb of mary they already knew they couldn't go down there and fight for him if you remember what he said before the sanhedrin court if i wanted to do you remember he said that if i wanted to he was letting them know i'm not i'm not who you really think i am i have the ability to do these things i lay down my life but if i wanted to i could call the army of heaven these creatures are like 150 200 feet high they have eyes where you wouldn't even think guys would be they have spears coming out that shred the enemy when they spin the the in satan's army they they have all kinds of weapons they turn into missiles and go to where the battle is and they come back to be their self and then they go in there and attack he could have called them to fight for him if he had said even one word they would have come but he knew he had to die so these two angels were in the garden with him their reward was they also were chosen to be in the tomb with him and they were the first ones to see him when he came back up from health i was recently in israel they're still outside the tomb they still protect it's a holy place they're still there they're on assignment they were the first ones who got to see him they're also the ones that talked to the disciples they talked to mary and they said why are you looking for the why are you looking for him he's not dead those two same angels were the ones who were in the garden with him with a cup so god does give rewards angels get rewards for completing what they were sent for now in this time they are millions of them have been sent to fight on our behalf we have the right to command them because they were made like a military and you can't go to an army a natural army and say would you mind please going over here and doing that could you imagine standing before hope or gay going to ship them out somewhere would you mind would it bother you uh please i have a request would you mind going over that they would look at you like you were nuts the army of heaven is the same way they need orders from headquarters well headquarters is here because the lord of hosts lives in us and they have been very very busy over these last few months and even more so now to make sure every single thing gets exposed they know where everything is nothing is hidden from god he knows where every stolen ballot is he knows where every every machine it was messed with or tampered with or changed or whatever he knows the name of every person who participated he is not clueless and he meant it when he said the exposure will be great so he said i said well what do you want me to do now i mean i i pray every night i'm not i call it prayer communication i talk to god if i have a request i spend another time just getting to know him i would just spend time talking to him like he was right here because he is and one day he walked through the wall of my home now he walks through the wall of my home all the time but they need you need to give them commands they can't take a written prayer request okay they can't do that back in the day even in the old testament i think it's in isaiah it said that the israel was under a siege for something i remember what it was and it said the captain of the host that's michael went to the far ends of heaven and gathered the army of heaven to come and fight on behalf of israel so that's the way it normally was done until 2014 there was already a major shift into our authority and dominion and i can tell you this the army of heaven cannot they cannot finish the whole purpose he made them if we do not do this they were always designed to fight for us amen i just want to assure you that trump i hear my in my ears all the time trump's winning trump's winning he's sitting in the white house he's going to sit in that white house he's not going to be evicted he will sit there and you'll begin even more and more to see him bring pension on different things because he'll be preparing him he will be preparing him to be president after him how do i know god said so i say what god says and i show you things that he showed me and he will sit in that white house and to me it doesn't matter what date they give that it is happening it's happening i've even already received a request to come and do um to pray for the president vice president at the inaugural prayer breakfast because guess what they're carrying on with their plans too [Applause] they're preparing like none of this ever happened they're already scheduling events for the inauguration making plans hiring companies to do things because they know the truth is everybody stand up for just a minute you don't have to wonder if you've ever been chosen if you're alive this is what caused it if you're alive and breathing you're chosen if you remember the body of christ you have greatness written all over you god's plans have already been written about you and god said these days that we're living now will be sung about in heaven in eternity this so this is not just another time on the earth this is an event on god's timeline it doesn't count time like we do it's all about events and this is an event in heaven part of the divine decade that we'll be living in and the things you'll get to do people have never even seen or heard of on the earth before because you're chosen nobody can tell you you're not i'm telling you you are chosen how do i know you're here if he times your birth on the earth and you are here you are chosen chosen to be great for him chosen to manifest the power of the living god it is a great thing to be a manifested son or daughter he trusts you you don't have to have a real high education it's not about how smart you are it's about how willing pray that my people be willing in the day of my power those who are willing and obedient shall eat the fat of the i know the word i don't carry a bible it's in here we were taught to read the word of god and know the word of god we were taught to pray before we could even speak we had family altar but it didn't make me not want god it made me want him more he loves every person in every country no matter where they are right now no matter who they are no matter what they're doing he still wants them so if he doesn't have us if he doesn't have the light in the spirit realm you have light coming from you some people have great light some people have light some people have darkness in them [Music] so i always know who knows the lord and he doesn't know the lord if there's any way possible now these people have to shake their hand they don't know they don't want me hugging well some might want to hang them it's so important to learn to release the anointing if you don't if you don't do that why did he put it in you to release it [Music] you only got to deposit [Music] it says in first john 2 27 when you receive jesus christ as your savior you receive a deposit of the anointing what anointing the anointing breaks the yoke that's what it is the more you release it the more it grows that was not peter's personal shadow that healed people it was the cloud of anointing because he released so much it builds a cloud sometimes you can walk in the room and it fills the whole room that's any believer any believer you have it in you it's a deposit so the more you give it out the more you get back and it never stops it just grows and grows and one day you feel yourself when you go i release the anointing you actually feel it it looks like blue fire shooting out of you so everybody put your hand here we're gonna stir it up say father i choose as an act of my will as a believer in jesus christ to release the anointing so stir it up okay now i want you to lay hands on somebody next to you and i want you to say with everything within you and you say this and you wait until i say i can feel i can feel leaving you i want you to open your hand the person say i release the anointing in jesus name i want you to see i can already feel it i want you to picture it leaving right here and it goes up your arm like blue fire written out of your arm so if i walk here like i can feel it coming from all of you it's like up here it swirls like a river the fire does everywhere i've been i feel it like waves hitting me right now it's very powerful i want you to say thank you jesus for giving me the anointing encourage me every day to use it wherever i go amen okay y'all stop [Music] [Applause] when i sit in a restaurant i always put my hand on the table and just say i release the anointing and i will see blue fire come out of my hand and coat that whole table it will never wash off it will never wear off whoever sits at that table will get the anointing on them i do the same thing to the glasses to the silverware when you go through a door if you touch the door release the anointing when you slide your card release the anointing everyone who slides their card in that thing will get the anointing on them before you send a text get it typed out let your hand say release the anointing when they open it the anointing will get on them [Music] it is transferable there's no excuse not to do it it is free you will begin really i'm not kidding you'll sit in the seat and get up and someone sits and they'll feel the anointing i can sit and people people's seats like when we used to do i used to do hospitality of our church of 5000. we would do the feed the board every once a year it would be like jesse and all kinds i can't remember other names right now but powerful men and women of god and they get up and leave i wouldn't be in there when they were eating i go sit in everybody's chair i knew who it was i always knew jesse i'd start laughing whoever was i i could feel it it's like light electricity on you if you want to have encounters if you want to feel the power of god it is in you it's already in you when you got saved he put it there you release it you can put on clothing like i prayed over their mantles like i release the anointing every chair in your office including your desk now has the anointing in it it doesn't matter where you go the more you do it the more will come out and you do that one day you'll be shocked and you'll feel it leaving you so when peter would walk past people we did it so much the cloud of the anointing like far exceeded him and when they said his shadow touched him they were healed and demons came out it was the anointing that breaks the yoke that you have don't ever forget this you have a weapon from heaven that breaks the yoke of darkness put in every gift you give every gift you give release into the gift if you give something away people release it if you give food to people release it don't ever stop doing that one day you walk into a place and people will fall out from the anointing the glory you create glory for god but you also carry the glory how do i know christ in you do you know what that means that's something that's deposited in you too the glory at one point will begin to be released from you it looks like it looks like shock waves of light the glory looks like light the fire looks like fire it feels like i when i see people release it it like shock waves i can almost hear it and it was somewhere speaking somewhere and the holy spirit said go back to the products table and as i started walk through the proxy table people started falling out now i talked about the glory in the meaning guess what it also makes a difference because of your soul that when you speak about these things it increases in your soul you can't hear something and then do nothing you can't do it heaven doesn't operate that way it's your actions along with your words if you want to rule you have to do something who cares what people think so i went to the broader table these people started falling out and i'm like i could feel like wow i could hardly i could hardly stand up on wow god they're really anointed aren't they i heard the holy spirit he laughs at me a lot he was laughing and laughing goes that is coming from you because i was looking no matter what these people are falling down they're lining people waiting to get products and my son-in-law who's my son-in-law just kept right on selling the products i'll always decide now just do this it was funny because okay okay what do i do you said just say already used to glory and i literally could see light waves go like shhh and whoever they touched they started falling down people got healed people got set free and went what is this when the bible goes the knowledge of the glory will cover the earth life the waters cover the sea he said it will cover them because you will be releasing it people will be this not just me this is for the body of christ christ in you is the hope of glory the glory being released showing up impacting people and nations and things and places that god wants you to go to this is what you get as a believer do it in your family's home how do you do that you just start doing it i release the glory i release the glory i release the glory just take time to do it pretty soon you can do that one day and you'll feel it coming out of you if you speak for christ if you share with people if you read your word it's building in you let it out let the anointing out let the glory out fire when the baptism in fire comes it's going to be so powerful it just burns the world out of you it burns any fear you'll never be afraid again the boldness that rises up in you you begin to carry that fire places will actually look like they're on fire buildings look like they're on fire people will see it on you one day his eyes were flames of fire our god is a consuming fire that is spiritual fire that will transform you and places and people because you carry it

or https://youtu.be/KKsMrCIJDRw
yes we are on right now i believe so hello everybody again it's always worth waiting for something from god isn't it and you know we all need extra grace here too sometimes but i don't know how much you heard or i don't know but we're going to start all over again so thank you for joining us i'm very excited that i get to share um revelation from heaven you're going to get news bulletins from heaven during this time you may even get something brand new given to me and if it comes from heaven i'm going to share it but this is the very main purpose for these this broadcast today is to share what time it actually is on god's timeline and many people don't know god has a timeline of course he does he created time and there are certain things he will make sure happen in this earth he made the earth he made us he put us here for a purpose and so guess what he has worked out this whole timeline thing even to the very end which by the way no matter what people say or think or try to calculate or assume only one person knows when the end will actually come that would be the father so even jesus knows that right so we're going to flow with what the father has figured out for this time and he does have a plan even while you're taking a unexpected vacay at home and i'm praying all the time for people you know and in their situations and how this is going to affect them in many different ways i have been outside at night in the street probably for hours praying over all of you and i want to say hi to my friends that would be my pastor friends who've invited me to come and share their place to bring heaven to this earth i'm excited that some of you actually get to see this broadcast and from now on as much as we can we're going to give you all a heads up if you would like to before we go live and then i'm very happy to be with all of you today and very grateful for all that you have done and paid a price for yourself to allow god to invade and inhabit your sanctuaries in your meeting places because you want the more of god and i hope everyone out there you have had an opportunity to be a part of meetings that give you revelation that train you that they don't just give you a nice little message that makes you feel warm and fuzzy but will make you powerful and dangerous against the darkness that's why we are here it's the body of christ that is the audience i'm speaking to right now to those who have been born again who've received jesus christ as your savior those are the ones i'm speaking to anyone else listening you're just going to get blessed anyway and by the way i need to let you know that my words carry the anointing that abides in me the anointing that breaks the yoke of darkness so if you're out there for other purposes or uh you have an agenda of your own zap bam you with the anointing so that when you leave this broadcast no matter what you thought you came here for you will be filled with the anointing aren't you excited about that we need to learn about these weapons god has given us like the anointing i may share a little bit about that later by the way this is not the only broadcast that we'll be making during our little vacay at home stay whatever we want to call that i don't like the word quarantine we don't actually have anything ourself right now and let me tell you we you will learn how to come against every spirit of infirmity sickness or disease before we end because most of the questions i get from people are what do we do about this can we do anything about this you know we're not over sickness what can we do well they obviously don't read the word of god because jesus said the things that he did we will do also in greater works and he was over sickness he was not under it you are over it you are not under it you need to start saying that yourself don't repeat every every doom and gloom thing you hear about today or you know this is the end we need to get ready to escape on the rapture rug i can tell you also this is not time for your rapture rug roll it up and stick it in the closet and as you've heard me say before get your crown on because the word itself says that we are kings and priests and to our god those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion that is something powerful christ gave us you need to learn to rule even in this time even while you're at home or wherever you are right now you know that you can speak words of authority and dominion and take that authority and it starts to change things number one open your front door if there's a lot of arguing going on if there's strife in your home right now open your front door and you evict it out right now you don't want to keep that stuff in your home make sure you're speaking words of hope and life and truth to all of your family and even to yourself so these are just little tips maybe the holy spirit may add throughout this broadcast because he really is the director no matter who we think we are what we're doing the holy spirit is the director of all these broadcasts if he wants something sad that's not on my little tiny tip list here then he's going to say it to me and if he says it you're going to hear it that's one of those news news bulletins from heaven but our primary purpose today is to discuss what time it is on god's timeline so that you be prepared for the future and by the way the main thing he wants me to say to you is this is a temporary situation some people act like it is the end of their life and it's not this is only temporary it will pass like many things that come and go on this earth this too will pass and hopefully you will be stronger and better and more understanding of god himself and be able to ruin reign in your own home learn how to crush the darkness and push it back so you will be stronger yourself and i want to also just add this i have called many different places where i do business with or a frequent and most of them have left the nicest kindest and encouraging messages on their answer machine for everyone to hear when you call just as an example i had to call steinmart because i have to know if i can still come in and make my little payment and guess what they said they said this is just a temporary setback we will be back and when we come back we'll be stronger we can't wait to see you again that should be your attitude not like it's all over oh god what are we gonna do now do we need to take all of our money out of the bank and go hide somewhere in the hills with it number one you can't spend it in the hills and number two i would not do that unless god told you to you're gonna need that bank account you're going to need it to still thrive and not just survive on this surge you're going to need a place to keep your money send your money and spend it and so unless he told you that don't run to the bank and drain your bank account and close everything he'll just be going back and reopening it later this is a temporary situation and i do take everything seriously people said you should be serious about this is really a desperate time i would not call this a desperate time i would call this god's time and i'm going to go along with what god says and what god wants and i'm going to keep my attitude excited and expectant because that's what you should be if you belong to him he knows where you are he knows every hair on your head he knows every day of your life he knows the day your mansion and your mention in heaven will be done he's already planned your homecoming so why not stay excited in your life and you choose to be happy instead of mad angry upset don't let that get into you and whatever you do you need to crush fear don't let fear rule you no fear no interfering of fear in your life and why i keep saying that because a lot of people are also i get listen i get text messages from people who actually have my number i get emails from all over the world i get phone messages left on our phones which we have obviously on our website that anybody can call us that wants to and so after listening to these or looking at these over these last few days i understand that people are in fear they're confused they're in fear maybe they've never faced anything like this before my mom would be sitting right here with her plum switch next to me saying hey they survived the depression this is not the depression it is not a plague and it isn't a disease it is a virus a virus comes and goes it also has a time limit and why have we chosen the symbol for our theme that says god's time and it shows an hourglass like an actual hourglass because the sands of time in an hourglass have a limit and when those sands pass through the hourglass that time is over well that's exactly how we see this whole situation it is a temporary time it is a limited time in your life and i look at this times break in time or moment in time that we're in right now is very special that means i get to spend more private time with god i actually will get to spend time with my family now that's exciting for me since i do so much traveling and i do a lot of broadcast i do a lot of other things that takes up the time on the earth in my life so i'm in one in one way i'm very grateful and thankful that i actually get to spend time with my family or maybe even call the family members i haven't seen in a while i hope you're going to take advantage of that maybe even make a few notes of wow i can spend time doing this instead of just being a fearful or upset or confused get rid of all those things in your life right now and fill yourself with the life of god the plans of god his expectancy you can choose with your own will to take this in one direction or another i hope you take it in one that takes you up and not down in this time god has planned on the earth he's not changing anything it's not going to change his plans or what he's going to do just because a virus is passing through and hopefully will pass out that would be i say rather than passing the virus just pass out and i want to also repeat something you're going to things i've heard god say to me and he this is what he says about this whole thing this is not a government takeover but it is a takedown of the virus so doesn't that sound much better than people yelling the the government's taking over they're going to take everything away we're going to have marshall uh law is going to come in and we're going to be be putting body bags and ships somewhere yes we've heard all these things given to us that is not what god's got planned and don't let your mind go in that direction okay we need to all be in agreement with what has been decided on for our best our government that is in place right now number one god chose our leader he's a powerful man he does love america and he's doing his very best to handle this in the best way and to think that anybody would even consider that possibly the country would work together to try to limit the spread of this uh virus and really care about us and he is talking about financial help i am not um crazy enough to think that that doesn't interfere in your life i understand we have to have money to buy things and to get supplies that we need and my prayer for all of you out there is that god will so inspire you feel you so full of him make sure you think about others other than just yourself because i know right now some people are kind of isolated with themselves but you do remember that all the people in this country are also experiencing the same thing at the same time which is rare okay there's people in other countries and many of them are my friends and i want to say hello to everybody out there who's not in america yes god cares about you too make sure you're speaking life and hope and the power of god and everything you say if people ask you questions about this going on say we hope in our god we trust in our god our god knows and he cares about us and he cares about people other people too so the way you think and the what you say makes a huge difference in the atmosphere of where you live this place i live in right here i call it my dwelling place because it's not a home it's my office this whole entire structure we used to call a home is now our office and i mean it's our studios it's our shipping receiving department it's a duplicating place and we have learned to adapt to that but god has a plan even in doing this this wasn't something negative he planned for us we had to adapt our own lives we do know at one point in our life we will get another home and i will so enjoy that personal space and private place but right now we're giving this place almost to the whole world so you will know who he is why he sent you to this earth what his plans are for you and we on purpose on the hourglass took the h off of the word it's not hourglass h-o-u-r o-u-r it's o-u-r it's our time with god's time it's us doing something together and one of the other things that we'll be talking about maybe not tonight are the keys to the kingdom and they they are so powerfully amazing christ gave us so many things to live with to make our life better if we apply it and that's another major thing for you when you get revelation from god it is not ever something just to hear it's something to live by and there are tips on how we can do that in the earth and make sure no matter what every day when you get up you ask for grace for abundant life it's free it's from god it will fill you with fuel from heaven so i'm going to encourage everybody out there listening let's just do this together right now because like i said i'm here to explain and train so i'm going to train anyone out there if you've not learned about asking for grace for abundant life there's two graces one is grace for eternal life that christ brings us the other one is grace for abundant life that even christ operated in it says in the word that as a child god this is the father filled his son with his grace that was grace for abundant life it's one of the reasons why christ was able to be happy and successful uh living downhill with mankind when he used to live in heaven with his father and then all of a sudden here he is on the earth walking just like you and i facing everything we did but he didn't sin how about that so don't let people tell you you cannot live sin free yes you can you choose but in this time we're going to ask for lord anybody hold your hands out if you're watching right now and repeat these words father i ask for and receive grace for this day for abundant life amen now i can tell you right now i feel it coming into me it's like a shower of a light electricity because i am a seer and uh you know i am a revelator i experience the things that go on in the spirit realm and that was fuel from heaven being poured into me that i will need for this day and if you get that every day of your life before you get out of your bed it won't always be your selfish self showing up it'll be heaven showing up you'd be surprised that just as few words that you've asked for and received will help to change what's in your soul and joy will flood your soul expectancy hope will flood your soul and then you'll be coming out ready for that day and so i hope of all of you who did that you don't never forget that it'll be one of the greatest things that i ever train you in is is called heaven protocol for heaven culture because i've been having many times no one up there is upset or angry or offended nobody's confused nobody losing deception there's no worry there's no anger or wrath up there they live in that abundant life grace so when you ask for you get filled with that it changed me from the first time the father taught me how to do that it changed me it was so important to him that he literally caught me up to heaven before his very throne and taught me that like i was eight years old most of the things god has in his word for us are simple but we in our human mind feel like we have to understand every single thing we reason it out we don't step forward in faith we use reason instead of faith faith is what draws heaven jesus said himself when i do return to the earth will i find faith he didn't say will i find divine wealth will i find uh you know will i find people laughing and celebrating what will i find so one thing he wants to know is will he find faith faith is something that creates for you is something that you can live with and live in every day of your life it is a source that you will even use when you get to heaven okay you get trained to do things in heaven also i won't even share some of those right now because that's going to be our next broadcast but you know what faith is more important than the food you eat or the air you breathe is faith it comes from heaven god fills you with it the more you operate in it it grows until you become very powerful in the spirit and it's hard for the enemy to deceive you these are simple basic truths in the word of god and people always tell me well not always some people say you don't even have a bible it's in here and it's very much alive i was raised by my earthly father who helped to take care of 15 of us how would you like that living here in florida we're in florida i love florida it doesn't snow you know we were from upstate new york we got frozen all the time we were the chosen frozen back then but now we're not and so you need to learn the important things in your life right now i know you say well we need a house to live and of course you do we need food to eat yes and here to breathe but even more important than those you need faith in god you need to be trusting him not just when things are going well but in the other times when things are maybe a little bit challenging or you're struggling with things even if it's something that's not good in your life you're struggling with it god still loves you he wants you to step out and use the faith everybody got a measure of faith the bible says some you need to learn to operate in it so it will grow and it will become productive and it will change the way you live your life in this day you're not supposed to be living in doom and gloom or hopelessness you are supposed to shine like the stars in the heavens by the way we are over those stars we're not even under those stars all that god made whether here or throughout the cosmos he made that for us we are his offspring he is our real father we came from him you need to know about your dna you need to know about the generations that went before you you need to know about the generations that god even had in heaven the ages that have passed down the earth that you don't even know anything about god holds that in his hand if he wanted to right now he could sit in heaven and hold the entire earth in his hand or he could become small enough to step inside you that's who he is he knows everything everything that was that is or ever will be that's who you are trusting right now with your life in the midst of these challenging times you need to trust him and make sure you say that he loves to hear you say i trust you god i trust your father even when i don't understand i am trusting you i will serve no other god there will be no other god before me and make sure by the way you say that to satan he hates to hear that by the way it makes him tremble in these days these few weeks we have of being with our family and being with god make sure you're productive in them make sure you take full advantage of them do fun things with your family create and to be very creative and inventive and adventurous in this time with them so they get hope built in them and not fear what you say what you say with your mouth right now is very important don't declare the doom and gloom don't declare the time has come where everything's going to end when god just brought you some of you have brand new babies in your life right now and children young children did you know he has generations of time planned for them too don't make a decision in your head that it's all over because then you'll be running and hiding you might miss something god has for you these are great opportune times for god to bring something new into your life new jobs new homes new positions do you know that's how he looks at it we need to all be in agreement for him to do what he wants how about if we say god we want your will your way you all know that scripture that talks about on earth as it is in heaven that is his desire for all of us and i know some of the prophets even pastors and leaders if they don't know what time it is you know what they do they go to the end of the bible and they start speaking about the end leaving out generations of time for things that god has planned that hasn't even happened yet on the earth some of the best times have not even happened yet i want to encourage you to seek god on your own get the word and stop reading it there's even scripture in the word that says jesus himself said even though that nation will rise against nation there'll be wars rumors of wars nations will rise against nation kingdoms shall rise against kingdom guess what he says at the end of that but the end is not yet so i will tell you from heaven from god himself the end is not yet so roll up your precious rapture rug and stick it in your closet and maybe get one that says this is god's time and then live by that time yes i know things are different in your life i know that they've said you can't go to church you can't do this nobody likes the word can't but you know they actually have a reason for doing that like i said just a few minutes ago this is not a this is not a government takeover this is a takedown of the virus their purpose is to try to limit the contact between people so that anyone who has that will not be able to spread it they're trying to limit the spread of the virus and you know even it has a time it has a very limited time that it even remains in your body it's a virus remember it's not a disease it's not a plague i think hell's about to experience a plague though it's called the faith of god in his people that's like a plague to them they don't like it they don't want to hear that and uh so we're going to make a lot of hell unhappy a lot of hell's army is going to be very unhappy because we'll be operating with heaven's army by the way they do exist also maybe we should take take seriously the things that god said in his word it is uh is a platform for life and how to live it it even has a time frame in itself but i can tell you you are not in the end day these are powerful days start thanking god for the things that you desire in your life get your children teach them how to ask for that grace do you know i have grandchildren that learned it when they were not even two years old yet and now that they're six and seven and eight if they start to have a meltdown do you know what they do they reach up and they say father i ask for more grace and their meltdown stops you know how this could change the way your children grow and live themselves this is a powerful time to get to teach them revelation that will even inform their whole life their lifestyle and how they live don't run into the darkness don't satisfy yourself with that i know they're even saying you know your entertainment can't take place why not entertain yourselves for a while i want to actually sit down and have conversations with each other i know there's still television out there and there's not much on that eye there is there i am grateful to god that he is taking hollywood which is one of the things he's had me talk about what does that mean that means he's taking that throne away from satan see he's got plans you maybe don't even know about he has big plans for this time god's time he calls it the kingdom age we're in a new season in this kingdom age there was the introduction of the kingdom age and we stepped off the platform into a new spiritual time that never existed you begin to hear new things that god had planned and things that you are able to do yourself and now we're getting into the season where we need to be activated and literally start doing those things i want to thank all those who who follow this facebook live or the my youtube out there you get filled with revelation all the time i hope you're applying that and you know what don't just apply it make sure you share it with others these words are not my holy words these are gods he's given a whole new way to live why not introduce a whole new culture on the earth instead of trying to change it's really hard to change a culture on the earth but why not introduce heaven's culture why not have a habitation of heaven in your home and not the world i'm not saying you have to throw everything out there is some funny things out there that are decent uh there are different games you can get and play or make up some of your own with your family i know my family was very creative growing up uh we had a lot of drama people in our lives and we had a lot of leaders and i can tell you the most challenging children you have right now are probably some of the most anointed that's a tip on letting you know that's why they are like that maybe they have a very powerful personality you know they have a strong will and they're so you know why god likes people who are strong-willed because when they learn his you can't change it you can't make them stop it god says that he likes strong-willed people when he gets him on the path he has nobody can pull them off so maybe that will encourage some of the parents out there who are now doing 24-hour a day homeschooling or home living i bet your children are excited about it they probably get to see you more now than they ever have before and so like i said take advantage of this time maybe have some cooking classes with your children they love to learn to do new things all the time my parents did that with us too that's why i actually do know how to cook and my sister jen who is here where are you jen just say hello i don't like her she gonna come say hello you know i couldn't do this without her i have a whole team of people here some of my family are part of what we do but this is my baby sister we call her number 15. thank you for saying hi jen we got some we have some fun things planned also like we're gonna do j and k in the kitchen i don't know when we'll do that but hopefully maybe during this next two weeks we'll be able to do that and we're actually have some cooking classes for y'all in our own kitchen now you know if i'm doing it's going to be sweets i have a sweet tooth blame it on jesus jesus loved honeycomb he lived on it all the time and i happen to know that before the throne of god people actually leave sweet treats for him because he loves them so we do have something a fun time in the kitchen plan with everybody and maybe you learn a super new recipe that we have for you but we have to have fun in these days also we're going to help you have fun we're going to have the fun depot and one of our events that we have broadcast will be just for children and they will be very excited of course you can listen and you can watch and we'll let you know well in advance we're going to have that we're going to have some really fun things for children and they will love learning about heaven and who their god is so i want you to look forward to this is a special time god can meet your needs you know i'm going to declare right now father i thank you for meeting the needs of everyone watching god and their other family members and those even not watching father i pray that you will give this team who's over this whole uh take now and the virus that they will give you give them great ideas on how to help in finances or even delay payments on things i do want to let you know there are actually already companies you're right jenna need a drink we've heard from companies that are actually going to delay people's payments if you have monthly payments doing different places planet fitness is one of those places if you're ever interested by the way i'm giving them a free commercial i am a member of planet fitness i don't always agree with the videos that they're showing you know on the screens but they have great equipment they have a great plan some of it's very inexpensive and it's a good way to get in shape which the holy spirit has said to us since we've been doing this heaven thing get in shape we have a long race to run but planet fitness has already announced because you know now they have to do all their stuff online and if you if you can sign up and watch it online learn some new exercises and stuff but they've already announced that they are not going to be charging their monthly fees as long as this is going on and you're not able to use their gym they're not going to charge you they're going to withhold your membership payments and i do know that there are other companies out there doing that and there are still some a few restaurants open of course two thumbs up for chick-fil-a chick-fil-a that's a company that was founded by god and is a really promotes the gospel if you work for chick-fil-a you are blessed in this world if you've never eaten a chick-fil-a don't show up on sunday because they will not be open they want to make sure you get to go to church we're going to talk about church in just a minute but chick-fil-a is open i think most of the ones that are is probably drive-through but there's even some that actually can come to the door the restaurant they've taken orders right there and then filling them for you they are actually getting witty ideas instead of just closing it all down because you know we can't meet in the restaurants or meet out in other places and i know you're missing a lot of your special favorite things do you know there's a thing called the royal fast that god taught me a long time ago the royal fast is even harder than the daniel fast you know to eat almost nothing is actually harder than giving up every one of your favorite things and you wouldn't believe it was unless you tried it but on the royal fast that's what he has me do off and on you don't go to your favorite places you don't even wear your favorite clothes okay you don't get to uh go and be with your friends who are your favorite friends you fast that and spend that time with him so i like to look at this as part of the royal fast because you can't go to your sporting events you can't go to your concerts you know you can't go out to your favorite eating places you can't meet with all your 20 or 50 friends you've got i pray god you've got friends and god if there are people out there that don't have any send them good friends who will lift up their life and not crush them down or held back you need friends in your life you need people in your life who are going to inspire and encourage you especially to know god but there are many places and even god i pray for those who have their weddings planned during this time family reunions planned i know a lot of things are getting interrupt interrupted right now i just want to encourage you again as i said this is for a temporary time remember the hourglass thing the sands of time are moving through and eventually this time will be gone and i hope you have great memories that you will create and make during this time make up fun photo shoots with your family but there are a few restaurants still open out there you know just check out and find out who they are get their time frame if you still feel like you need to go there meet with very small groups of people and like here in our city now they have closed the beaches one of my favorite places even if i don't get to go there very often so people were learning this is the thing people were learning that they could not gather inside places and have big events together or just have a party together they started doing it at the beach our beach here is free it's a very long beach a beautiful beach and they started doing that i mean huge groups 50 people here and they were meeting and they weren't listening to what was being asked of them and so now they have closed our beaches i'm sure people are still bicycling up and down you know maybe outside the beach but i just want to encourage you please try your very best to go along with what they have asked us to do for a short period of time and when we do that things are happier the atmosphere is better knowing that we're working with the government or your city authorities or other people who are in charge they're wanting to help to preserve our life and like i said before this is not about limiting our life this is giving the right to live without that virus and father i pray for all those out there if it's already invaded your life family members or yourself god i pray for them and take authority over the sickness jesus was over sickness we take authority everybody to say it together i will no longer tolerate sickness sickness or any virus or any virus in my city in my city in my home in my home and i command it and i command it to go to go in jesus name jesus in jesus name and do you know there's even a blessing when you bless your dinner did you know that you should end your blessing the bible says that when you do that when you bless god and you bless your food it says he will take sickness far from you you may not have ever read that scripture but you know i do remind god this is what your word says i i thank you for blessing my food to the nourishment of my body i thank you for the provision of it and that might be a good idea to do that now even if you don't have food thank him for it and asking to bless what is coming to you our own family experienced people we would give so much away our own family we'd even give our food away and then my dad would have a set the table and thank god for the food and i am not making this up people would show up at the door with food so don't limit yourself to what man thinks or man's ways not even your normal ways step outside your box and believe that god cares about you but yes this is good news chick-fil-a is still open it's all drive-through there's many few a few drive-throughs like i said they're different in every city so check in your city make sure you pray for your local government as well as the federal government pray for all them to hear god's plan to get witty ideas to use sound wisdom get them to step outside the box and make sure you bless ask god to bless them it says to bless those who are over you when you begin to do the things the bible says things are going to start happening for you so don't get moved by things you move things this is a kingdom age quote you don't get moved by things they don't get moved by this virus are you having to stay at home are you being quarantined make sure you move things by declaring and decreeing taking authority in the spirit realm over anything the enemy is trying to do against you those of you who already command an army from heaven and yes that is possible jesus did we can too he harkens they hearken unto the word of the lord he is the lord of hosts he sends them here and yes it is our privilege to send them to pull down strongholds they are our mighty weapons to put on strongholds against the enemy and i know jen is standing here with something in her hand if i'm talking even in a church or someplace my family have to get in front of me and jump up and down because i'm so focused like when i look at this camera i see you it isn't just a camera it is a portal to the whole world that is watching and when i bless you in the name of the lord you know what happens the host of heaven the army will carry blessings into every home that is right now connected to this facebook page right now whether you're watching it now or later i bless you in the name of the lord and your finances and your families and your food supply your creativity i bless you in jesus name because i really mean that and i'm gonna let jen say something to me what is it jen oh okay yes we will do we will add something else because you know there is somebody on the earth on the earth in this country especially working very hard for all of us even if you don't like him even if you don't understand him even if he's not perfect i will tell you this yes god chose trump and yes we here at one quest international that's my company and studio oq1 we are supporting our president not just in his decisions right now but in his reelection which god has assured me for all those wondering yes he is still god is still planning on him winning in 2020 and we have created this little uh video to support what he's doing letting you know we trust and that god has chosen him and believe in him so we're going to let you see our little promo for the trump 2020 race [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so well we're back i hope you enjoyed that and again as i said that we are going to support um president trump right now in the decisions you know they're not easy the decisions he has to make but he has such hope for this country and not just this country but for the people of this country and i know you hear me talk about america but you know what this is where i'm from this is my realm this is where god sent me to live i am aware that there are other countries out there even great countries that have done wonderful things for god you know i could start listing them and man then we go forever but i do want to say you know some of the greatest revivals we've had in the past many of them were actually in um in the uk and i can tell you they're the covenanters of scotland there was patrick and all the kings he won for jesus christ in ireland and then the welsh revival wow if you never read about that maybe in this time you should go back and and to study these things and maybe share something with your family because there were great people on the earth before we were here and we're going to be great for god because he wants us to be and then even when some of you go on to heaven there'll be more great people on the earth because god wants us to be great for him and with him and so i am grateful for president trump if you haven't decided i would encourage you to vote for him and nominate him you know in this new election in 2020 which will start a whole divine decade for us and while we're talking about your time right now at home this little break in time uh we're going to actually show some fun things because we like to laugh laughter is a medicine it's also a weapon because satan can't get to you when you are laughing so i hope they make you laugh here's something we've taken off of facebook and other people have made it's fun so here we go we're going to start watching some of them right now i hope it makes you laugh and we did enjoy every single one of these jen did her best to get some of the best ones and if you have opportunity to see them or even create some yourself that might be a good idea i think one of my favorite ones of course is this whole discussion about the toilet paper you know i do have some rolls i haven't counted them lately but um maybe you could count them and let us know how many you have and put it in your comments you know that might be fun for people to read oh i've got 10 you know i've got 100 if you've got 100 you better be sharing them with other people right and uh but people can be very fun and you know who gives that humor it's god and so i hope you laughed at those there's many many more out there um being shown and this is funny i love it when the pastors and this i'm just going to give rod parsley a you know a thumb two thumbs up rod that was a great little funny thing you did with the toilet paper with the tp and uh i think tp's taking on a whole new meaning right now during this time never have we had so much discussion about toilet paper and uh who would who would think that would be an item of interest right not just that of course paper towels come right in behind that and tissues and we go down that hole line and you can tell what the most important things are right when you go to the store what is missing the tp and even some of the suggestions that other people have of what we could use instead i haven't found one good suggestion okay i'm not adam and eve i'm not gonna go pluck leaves off the tree that's not gonna happen with me and so but i know people people love humor and sometimes that's a door that will open things for people to have discussions with you like my pink hair i might mention briefly about the pink hair i honestly i mind sitting here i cannot see the pink hair on my head and believe it or not sometimes i forget it's there but this was not my plan this is an example of god's plan right here this painter on my head and yes it does divide asunder the flesh from the spirit people who don't like it who bash it who say horrible things against it they're operating in the flesh the people think this is a great idea wow god is so creative look at that you know what the rainbow belongs to him why not have color on your head why not wear some of it on your head and so that's the spirit the walking in the spirit walking in the flesh and so god's bringing many new things to this earth hair color is one of them and i'm taking another little drink of my strength that my man ran up and got for me because you know i've been talking a lot i'll be talking a whole lot more and so why not put fun in your life and i remember years ago when the holy spirit told me yes fun is a medicine laughter is a medicine the word says it is but he said to me while i'm at a platform i can't remember where it was might have been up north somewhere he said did you know that in this time that laughter is actually a weapon fun is a weapon i mentioned that a minute ago why is it a weapon satan will put all kinds of thoughts in your head and the word says take every thought captive that takes itself above the plans of the life of god that means anything that is not good anything that does not bring life or hope or fun creativity or you know to inspire you encourage you it says to take those thoughts captive that means don't let them keep running through your mind if you've got bad thoughts running from you through your mind guess who sent them it was hell right not heaven heaven wants life for us and life more abundantly for us so you need to realize what is running to your mind what are your thoughts saying what you think about enough is what you will do and that's what my husband says also you will do what you will to do and your will is affected by the things you read the things you watch and get this even the things you say will affect the way you live your life so make sure you are laughing that you make others laugh especially in this day it really makes the enemy very unhappy i will give you a list of things that satan hates he hates people who love especially when they're not being loved back he hates it when we're kind to one another right he hates it when we laugh he hates it when we learn to celebrate he hates it when we realize that he is the one causing all the grief all the hate he comes to kill steal and destroy that's going on in your life that comes from one place and they don't get any thumbs up they get thumbs down there's two thumbs down for help right and while you're doing your dinner blessing why not ask for triple trouble in hell you'd be amazed what you could ask for and god will actually do it and so i just want you to realize there's a real devil i have been to heaven i have been to hell you want to choose heaven hell is not a place it's not going to be r r there's no parties in hell no food in hell no rest in hell that does not exist there's torture plenty of it non-going ongoing torture that is what is there don't side with the enemy don't help him advertise negative things hateful things mean things don't repeat things that are going on with your friends and especially don't repeat negative things about your family if you're going to stand for their salvation you need to make a stand the bible says stand and stand there for that means you declare that there will become a a living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ you declare that they will not miss the destiny god has planned for them you declare that they will know christ and serve him all of their life those are powerful piercing words in the spirit realm and yes it does do something for your loved ones as well because you're making a stand for them even if they're not nice to you and i know that happens okay they're not nice they hate you they don't want to talk to you all that comes from what and the enemy is doing with their lives so why not make a stand and don't change the stand in other words don't be double-minded if you're saying something powerful god will do don't turn around and say the opposite you don't want to wipe out what you just prayed and i can tell right now in this time you need to be declaring that this is the time for celebration for expectation a time for god to propel you on your path that it says we go from glory to glory do you know that's an upward motion i want to go from glory to glory to glory i don't want to go from glory to the pit and fall into despair and fear glory to the pit where are you going you are going nowhere so kick out of your life choose what you will to lose from your soul any fear any anger any any uh deception any confusion all that stuff comes from the enemy you bind to your soul because i will say this one of the things we will be learning about over these this next week or so is the keys to the kingdom and how that opens up there's my key right there how the keys to the kingdom will open up things in your life you never had before and it will eliminate things you don't want your life that you have not wanted for a very long time but keep coming back and bombarding you or tormenting you you can use the keys of the kingdom to get rid of them an artist friend of mine did a painting and sent it to me which is so beautiful it shows a person with a key about to put it in a keyhole and inside this whole keyhole you see heaven what are they doing when you use the keys of the kingdom you are unlocking heaven to operate in your life so i know a lot of revelation but right now we have decided and god has asked us to do this broadcast mainly to let you know that this is not the time that he's wrapping everything up this is not the time for the tribulation and as the holy spirit says the four horses of the apocalypse are still in the barn and you know what the nephilim are not roaming the earth right now coming to knock on your door and drag you out in the streets uh the antichrist this is truth the antichrist and you can say i believe it or not the antichrist the antichrist spirit is on the earth because that's satan and the antichrist spirit is anything that is against god that would be like a false religion that's an antichrist spirit anyone who is against christ himself and speaks against him trying to say he is not the son of god that none of that stuff is true in the bible that is an antichrist spirit the antichrist spirit is on the earth but the antichrist himself and there's even some people to say he's not going to be here either they are mistaken at one time generations down god's timeline those things he said in his word they will happen he has a purpose for them happening even when we don't understand them but you're in a blessed time to be alive on this earth you are not living in the time of the tribulation or the perilous times or the antichrist who will actually embody a person it's just satan embodying a person that's what that is the antichrist is not on the earth he and what he will do is not on this earth right now because the word says until he until he is removed that withholds the antichrist can't come guess who that he is it's us the body of christ ruling and reigning with christ the manifested sons and daughters speaking to the lamb the sea and the air commanding things to happen with jesus christ and they happen if they were all still here the antichrist would not be effective people wouldn't even receive him it wouldn't be the tribulation time because this time of the manifested sons and daughters on the earth things will be great things will be healed things will be better we're living in the time okay god's time right now is for us to be great for him to take the knowledge of the glory that's not just a saying that is an action the glory of god coming from you is like it's like something begins to just go and waves from you and it will remove the enemy in people's lives it will invade their life their very person with the presence of god it's like a cosmic shock wave like if i have my staff right now and i just hit it on the ground wherever i declare things from god and i hit my staff which is always out with me at three in the morning as i'm declaring the things of god i see in the spirit a shock wave of the fire of god going that's what the glory will do you will take that around this world and that hasn't even begun to happen yet so we're not living in the perilous times we're living in the great times of god the times and all those things would begin to happen he talked about be excited you're alive be excited you have children yes it's a good idea to get married and have children they'll be greater than you will look forward to your children doing greater things and being greater for christ than even you this is just the beginning of a time on the earth that's never existed so this is not the very end he is not going to wrap it all up and roll this earth away when he hasn't even begun to do the things he himself declared would happen look forward to celebrating with you i look forward to sharing with you that god is about great things he's behind the scenes of everything on this earth right now even leaders it's a time of being shifted god is shifting the leaders of governments so he can then shape their nation and that's what's happening in our country right now no matter what you think of it or how you look at it the virus thing that gets attached and now it'll be gone okay i hope you'll be greater and more powerful in god and like i said give your family a lot of love because one day you'll be out there back to work again maybe you'll even have your own business look forward to the great things of god trust him to do the things and thank him for the things he's bringing to your life and so father we all declare together let's declare this together everybody watching make sure y'all do it [Music] say father father as a child of god as a child of god i make a declaration i make a declaration that this virus this virus is passing quickly it's passing quickly so your time so your time can be done in the earth can be done on the earth and that is what will be established and that is what will be established we all ask for we all ask for and receive and receive and want to walk in and want to walk in your will your will your way your way we invite heaven we invite him and push back the darkness in our life and push back the darkness because we serve you because we serve you and you alone and you alone we pray for our presidents we pray for our presence and all those under him and all those and those who are in charge and those who are in charge of watching over us watching over us during this time during this time our little break in time our little break in time thank

and decree in your word and so as she decrees your word lord we ask we honor her as a prophetess we honor her as a as your as your oracle but lord we thank you lord as she speaks we ask that you would bless her so much you would bless her you would overcome her with blessings overcome her family with blessings that you would bless them in everything that they set their hand to and lord we thank you now as we just honor cat as she comes in jesus name amen amen come let us have it sister [Music] good morning this is early for me for those of you who don't know me i i go to sleep around 6 30 or 7 now it used to be four but now i'm up even later so uh i'm i'm so glad to be here you know because i get stretched in this time and yet some of the most powerful things come out of me in this time and so i i can promise you first of all i'm going to share what was going on in the spirit realm while all this worship is going on you have some new hosts that are posted here as sentinels and uh i used to call them well well they look like native americans but no they've always looked like that there's whole tribes of angels that look like that that wear garments like that with the symbols you know and the way that that came into this world was god has always had seers and some of the first nations were seers and so they took some of those images that they've seen on these beings and they put them on their garments they put them on their on their tents their homes uh many of the things you buy that are called southwest images are actually images from the throne room and he has some pretty wild drummers up there and they were here today and there were two new ones i had not seen they weren't even here yesterday they're about 70 foot tall they had fallout headdress on them they had pelts with living eyes the feathers had living eyes every feather in the headdress they were like blue eyes all over them and their garments just shown with the glory and there's one right there and there's one right there and they were dancing the whole time we were dancing and i could hear that drum i love the drum drum sound from the throne room um when that is played and they were playing somewhere outside playing there were those two main ones but there are others and then some came in and were dancing on this platform and i recently saw the same ones in reno nevada on the platform and they're angels of freedom they were they were doing a freedom dance here and uh freedom is coming from everything at the enemy in golden in denver colorado [Applause] and if you've ever seen some of the the first nations or the native americans dance when they do that thing where they're like this they were up here there were two of them and they're like dressed in blue they have blue feathers going at the very top of their head right up here and there have eyes in those feathers and all the feathers coming off of their wings have eyes and when i saw them in reno i asked the lord what are they and he goes those are freedom dancers bringing freedom to the area so i i can tell you also that god is taking las vegas and reno as regions of as regions of glory this will be a region of glory where crime or sickness where disease cannot exist so i was i was so excited when i saw them here today and went so i knew who they were i knew what they were and i could tell you the men that were dancing you were dancing with them up here on the platform and the glory was just rolling off of them as they were dancing the glory and so freedom and liberty is coming uh tour land two to colorado to nevada god is taking those regions all right so your lives will not be the same and even after this weekend you cannot remain the same because when you have stepped into and receive what god is offering in this time you can't miss or escape receiving it you're going to get it because you said yes everyone yell yes now look look up and so say i say yes [Applause] and so uh well i'll try to speak if i can but they they're really outside right now looking in there are they are huge beings and in in their chest they have these strips of like it looks like gold metal to me it's probably real gold i'm sure it is and in them and all these metal pieces are shaped like that and they have living eyes in them in the front in the back to see anything of the enemy that comes against this ministry against your people these beings will drive them off and deal harshly with [Applause] them yes yeah just like the things of the enemy are drawn where there's evil where there's darkness where there's hate where there's violence and i know a lot of people think well i won't go watch movies that have immorality in or defiling language but violence is just as bad it is and i want to remind you that one of the accusations the father had against lucifer was you have filled yourself with violence so be aware when you go to watch something make sure it's not graphic sadistic torturing violence because that will go in your soul you don't want it in there amen we're about life not death watch things that give life they bring celebration in your life they're going to help your soul to prosper there is a promise for divine help there really is even as your soul prospers you will prosper in be in hell that is a state of existence coming to the body of christ who will let their soul prosper so we need to keep the darkness out the violence out anything defiling keep it out you have to guard that innermost part of your being the very heart of your being is where your soul is that's why it was so important when god said adam became a living soul we are not just people we're not just a spirit we're the with a body people go well we have a soul no you are a soul according to the father you are a living soul it's one of the main parts of you you can't leave that out of your life you can't remain ignorant of your soul because it's what you think on what you choose and then what you do i would say that was you yeah so more and more in this time we must be aware of of our soul and what we're letting in there as a man think us in that place so is he out of your soul will flow the way you live your life the issues of life out of it before the issues of life that means the way you will live your life that's what the father told me and so the soul is very key in your life even in your children's lives what you put in their soul growing up it's going to help them become who god wants them to become you're not just raising a child not even the next generation you are shaping souls in your life every day you're shaping your own soul your soul gets fed 24 hours a day whatever's going around you whatever you're whatever you're seeing watching saying or hearing it goes in there it goes in there a lot of meetings but i get excited i had to almost sit on myself to not start screaming [Applause] i've heard that around the throne i have been there and i've heard it it is stunning you will get so undone by the glory over the throne and the seraphim who come down and dip out of there they're so full of the fire they are on fire they sing some of the most beautiful song they will dip down over the throne and go back up and dip down over the throne and go back up yeah satan didn't get any of them even in heaven they choose how much of a relationship they want it was obvious and you would think the ones who were created for worship would not have been deceived but they were the very ones because they followed they began to follow the one who led them not the one who made them if they were deceived by the enemy deception is still it is an anti-christ spirit and even then it was it was even jesus said it was then it was there even then it was there and so i think one of the most one of the most number one weapons the enemy uses today when he realizes because of our relationship our intimacy with god when he realizes he's not going to get us to just outright sin then he will try to bring us into into deception or distraction because we need to stay on that path we are running after him and no matter what i talk about about the encounters that i i've had or what i've seen or the revelation he's given me still the number one thing in my life is to pursue him to be passionate about him to desire his heart his ways his words his presence it feeds me i eat less and less because i eat of him there's a whole revelation about eat my flesh and drink my blood that is total consumption of who he is you are totally consuming all of him all of what he did i love to talk about the blood of christ i was caught up to heaven take him back in time and i saw him pouring out his blood on the mercy seat so many encounters but nothing more powerful than knowing the love of christ to know him to know not just know about him but to know him and he said that if you pursue him with all of your heart you will find him and when you find him you will want to be just like him it says when we see him we will no longer know in part or understand in part it says now we see darkly like through a glass we see in part we know in part but when you see him you will no longer know in part that means you will know details that means you will know his heart his ways have his thoughts so don't ever stop doing that no matter what you go after in your life don't ever leave him out i have written in the front of my bible don't ever let me get to a place where i do not need you [Music] in the past god would do things to make sure that people weren't elevated above because of the revelation that they got you know even in paul that thorn of flesh he got was blindness it would come and go it would attack him and go attack him and go and a lot of people don't know what that is they they try to figure it out but it's in the word because paul said the first time i came to you you wanted to give me everything if possible you would have plucked out your very eyes and given them to me why would he have said that why did he need to scribe all the time because it was hard for him to see to write so whenever he penned a letter that said i have penned this with my own hand you need to go back and read those because he was so fierce about having this given to them and them living a right life a powerful life he would write that himself even with that on him now i can tell you that he stopped asking for that to be removed when christ said my grace is sufficient my grace is sufficient for the evil for for the day for the evil thereof and that was grace for abundant life christ was talking about christ never came to put sickness disease infirmities he never brought poverty with him he didn't bring fear with him he didn't bring hopelessness or unworthiness he didn't bring any of those he came to bring light and life more abundantly and we need to walk on that today now not just when you go to heaven [Music] in the past people died to move to heaven to walk in a certain way on in their life they were free from everything creative inventive in heaven adventure excitement fun no fear no hate no deception no distractions filled with the light and the glory of god but in this time on the earth we have a commission to live a whole new way so what you've been hearing me talk about is not just some nice things to make you feel good it is so you can have a new lifestyle to live on earth as they do in heaven that's not going to be a normal life it's going to be the most amazing life you have ever lived in this world and god wants it wants it seen openly and visibly in our lives the goodness of god overwhelming us flowing off of us wherever we go the creativity of god we are supposed to be creators like our father say amen let us make man in our image what is your image he's a creator what is christ's image a commander they rule there's no higher level anywhere in existence than the the triune godhead and yet how awesome is that that he said that statement in genesis let us make man in our image and after our likeness that word likeness means operate like we do we are joint ears with christ he walked in so much and we're living so far below that but in this day because of revelation this is what revelation is it comes from the heart of the father it does not come from the mind of man so it will not sound normal to you it won't even make sense to you sometimes it seems absolutely impossible but with god nothing is impossible all things through christ are possible so we need to understand and realize what did christ give us when he came here what was he on this earth walking as a righteous man he had power and authority over the storms he multiplied the food he raised the dead all the time he never blinked at one demon not one demon was he afraid of where he went they were tormented he could shift time and step in the spirit realm and walk through people he didn't walk around those crowds he walked through them because the spirit realm supersedes this natural realm that's why angelic means can walk through the walls so christ did all these amazing powerful things and then he says the things i did you will do and greater things than he did we will do we're still trying to figure out the things he did you're not getting anything without faith you're not ever going to get to a point where you don't need faith to do things you have to start trusting god and telling him you trust him he wants you to say something he loves it when you make declarations he gets up off the throne and he shouts when he sees people on the earth with faith christ didn't say when i come will i see power will i see dominion will i see creativity will i see souls being saved no we didn't say they said well i see faith and so many people they just want things but they don't even use their faith you go from glory to glory because of your faith your faith can grow when you when you hit a certain level your faith just gets accelerated where no matter what he has said no matter what that word says you live it like it's truth we all have measures but did you realize that a measure means it can be increased [Applause] if you pour something in a measuring cup can you add more and you can get a bigger cup until it's pouring over isn't that what it says overflowing if you get to a place in him i want everybody to say this christ operated without measure on this earth [Music] his dream and his purpose is for us to get to that place in him where we also operate without measure i know what i'm talking about because i was uh in law i i worked in law that was a god thing told totally let me tell you they hired me with no experience because i was anointed with favor and literally i was hired because of the favor not because of my typing skills trust me you type 40 words a minute no one's going to want you in the natural but i was taught i was hired and i was taught by the lawyers how to do real estate law estate planning business law i learned all kinds of these different levels of the different law and the legal system one thing i really got was in a probate in a state i totally knew what it meant when it said you were a joint heir if you're an heir to somebody even like in england the heir to the throne no one can say you can't have that it's written as law in those countries so guess what was written in heaven as law that there was a last will and testament called the new testament that the the names of these books aren't just put there because they sound good every one of those names means something like revelations someone tell me there's nowhere in the bible that talks about revelations i said god calls me a revelator i'm here to reveal heaven i'm here to reveal the spirit realm i'm here here to reveal the true authority of the believer the dominion and authority of the believer and they go there's no such thing as a revelator i think john was one a revelator simply means you reveal the things of god and what do you think revelations were those were the revelations john re received and shared things never heard of before things that were hard to comprehend you think the book of revelations is easy to understand it's because it came from the heart of god and he reveals himself all the time even john the baptist gave some of the most shocking revelations of all time he was totally shifting the way that those who believed in god were going to live hey they knew you had to go to temple and make sacrifices and once a year your sins were forgiven and here was this wild man wearing camel hair turned inside out lived in the wilderness he looked like a wild man ate locust and honey was his diet pizza and chocolate ice cream is a whole lot better and so is pink hair pizza there's pizza in heaven yes i do like it but i like thin crusts not that zero calories yes and zero calories in heaven it's one of the reasons why they call it heaven but it's the place where things have never been heard of or seen or even understood but god has prepared for those that love him but i love the next part of that scripture unless and accept it be revealed by his spirit so that shows you the things of god can be revealed there are mysteries in the word and the first time you hear them you'll be shocked that they were there all along but you didn't see them because they were a mystery but god loves to share them with his children so be more like a child laugh a lot more dream imagine the impossible there's places telling you not to even do that anymore and yet let me tell you if you're an artist if you don't imagine things you can't you can't produce or create that god puts that in us to be creators uh like an inventor that's still a creator right inventions witty ideas we're creators you should be creating something all the time you should be doing something new all the time you should be new all the time i heard the father yell tell them to be new do something new go someplace new think of something new say something new don't remain the same old same-o that's right yeah don't be boring see this world needs to see this they need to hear this they need to know that you can live without fear when you belong to jesus christ because you do have power over all the power of the enemy that we can crush the plans of darkness that we can have none of him in us [Music] and be dangerous [Applause] i love the whole army thing yeah heaven has an army strange weird fierce unshakable unstoppable created by the hand of god himself to defeat that army of darkness but they were never created to guard heaven that army didn't even kick out satan the father did the father did he didn't even get off the throne went up there shaking in heaven he wasn't shaken in heaven but lucifer was going around tempting all of them he knew he would lose but he was going to let others see who really was worshiping him who really had given herself to what they were created for we replace all the angels that worship before the throne so you go before the throne every single time you worship that's how he inhabits the praises of his people you're connecting with heaven every single time you worship so when you hear about heaven it should be something oh yes i was going to tell you what else i saw right before the trumpet blew i heard the lord say that calvary is coming i was really having fun in this service because i was seeing um heaven here and what they were doing then i saw the people connecting the worship connecting the dancing connecting that they were all hearing what heaven was saying and singing so they played it and the dancers were actually impressed by what the angels were dancing up here they were doing the same thing yeah and even the ones outside and the drummers that were lightning bolts were shooting off of those drums [Applause] and and i would get so undone i had to sit down so i wouldn't fall down because the glory was so thick in here and they would dance and dance then he would turn and look in the window to watch you dance and worship and flag and shout [Music] [Applause] [Music] every congregation needs a seer because you get so excited to really see you are a part of what heaven is doing that's right because every time you shout it whenever you shouted they shouted in the throne room every time you shouted something the throne room shouted it [Applause] and the father would sit there and he would laugh and laughter he threw his head back because there are those who worship in spirit and truth on the earth and every time we do it it pierces the enemy and every time we do it there's the father began to laugh and it goes like dominoes around all of heaven it just starts like a wave of people laughing and laughing and laughing because there's a people who worship in spirit and truth the enemy doesn't want anyone to worship anything but him and you you know he stole the glory that's what he did he wanted to be the glory and have the glory and he wanted all of it even when he was in heaven that was a bad decision bad decision so we get to carry the glory produce the glory and carry the glory around this world for him and is going to undo this world they will be undone i've seen some of that happening and i know it will it will cause thousands to run into the kingdom because they know what kind of life they've been living they know what darkness is everything darkness has marked everything it's left its mark in the movies in books and children's toys in apparel it's just marked everywhere it's about to be wiped out because heaven's going to put its mark on everything [Applause] you'll be able to buy home decor things to decorate your home with rugs things to put on your windows even the furniture will have symbols and images of heaven on it and you are past it'll speak because god is going to put his anointing on it it's one of the ways the glory will invade this earth that's one of the reasons why heaven is invading this earth you'll sit on your amazing self of this anointed and you'll just hear sounds from heaven your walls will release frequencies from heaven in them you've already created when you create an atmosphere for heaven to inhabit your home and it will if they see the life of god they see worship they see honor being given to the name of the lord jesus they cannot escape they cannot they want to be and know your lives they're watching your lives they've all been watching your lives and they're cheering you on they are heaven is very much aware of what's going on this earth your own family members are up there cheering you on run your race don't get off the track this is an accelerated time the race will be greater the impact on the earth will be greater the glory will be greater the revelation will be greater the creativity will be greater the blessings and the and the wealth will be greater than ever before what we build for god on the earth in the spirit and then the physical is about to be accelerated because this is god's time for that to happen so when you step into what he wants you can't escape being blessed you're not going to escape he used to say that to me other times you are not going to escape when you say you're going to go say this and you will not escape doing it okay no matter what they think no matter where it is or what it is i'm saying it and i'll say it as loud and as boldly and as often as you want to you want me to i laid down my life died to myself and i live in christ and the devil can't impact a dead person he can't tempt a dead person he can't put fear in them if there's none of him in you he can't do anything to you amen jesus said i give you power over all the power of the enemy to tread upon so i can't even say it serpents and scorpions tread upon them and nothing by any means shall harm you we're living in those days in this new time we are living in those days that our life will be different because we will be living on earth as they do in heaven if you heard me talk you know a lot about heaven you should know a lot about heaven because god is bringing revelation on purpose why is he showing us heaven why do we need to know how it operates what is life like there what goes on what places does he have what do they get to do you need to know that because we're going to live like that down here oh yeah they worship it's called living worship not just in the throne room bowing down sometimes everybody just jumps up and down for fun [Applause] yes it's holy but it is fun some people think why should i even go to heaven it's going to be so boring no you've lived boring down here because they have the greatest adventures in heaven god wouldn't have said you must be like little children to enter into the kingdom of he'd be in big trouble if we all got up there and we were like you know old minded with all the fun stuff he's made but he knows when you come there that's how you feel because you're free of any cares any concerns you're not always warring just to to stay safe and pay your rent everyone up there pays for nothing god has already made a provision and supplied your mansion's built before you ever get there and everything you want love or need is already there but god has a sense of humor the number one thing before besides going in the throne room people love to do is take tours of heaven and they have tour guide angels that has a cap that says tour guide and they have a money changer belt you know the little things that go push click click click and the coins come out nobody has money in heaven they do it for humor and and and you'll get there for the first time they'll they already know who the new people are because they're like this and then walked up one of these tour guide angels and they go um do you have your pass [Laughter] on purpose and you hear people all around they're giggling because they know you don't need a pass however the real characters go his name is jesus christ so if you've got one in your family this probably will be the response some of the others are like we need a pass who gave out the passes and people laugh i mean they will laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh there's no past required and you're not going to give anybody money to go anywhere [Applause] you can step on a road of light and just go yourself and everybody talks about the humor of god but but when you really experience it you realize how funny he can be and his goodness people live in his goodness about a year ago he started saying start declaring the goodness of god over your family your friends especially your enemies there's almost nothing more fun than blessing those who are cursing you as a seer especially it's a lot of fun because i see the demons controlling the people who are blasting me and i'm blessing them and those demons are going stop [Music] they're screaming it's like arrows piercing them because i'm giving them life which cancels out the death that's why he said bless those right who curse you pray for those who despitefully it's powerful blessing is a weapon joy and celebration is a weapon fun is a weapon they laugh all the time in heaven they have amazing adventures there's so many places to go and visit in heaven valley of the falls passionate paradise techno city cartoon village jello land the friendly forest the sky mansions valley i always say valley falls i love that place the mountain of spices that they mention in the word really exist in heaven the all the aromas of thanksgiving and fall the leaves are like this big and they're the most beautiful uh every kind of color you can imagine if you love the fall your mansion will probably be in the mountain spices i mean from burgundies to literal gold and all those shades in between the deep vibrant oranges and some are even blue these trees are like 200 foot tall and you can hike as far as you want and never get tired [Music] if you like to backpack on horses the horses will be it will be their pleasure to take you and they will have conversations with you all the way up they'll even show you some of the best places to go and see a tour guide without the cap oh yeah the hunting is in heaven is something else people say nothing dies oh no nothing dies [Laughter] you have photo shoots you capture what you're hunting by photo you have a scope camera i'm serious about all this uh somebody well known i don't ever mention their name but i always tell the story it's amazing one of the encounters i had a young man had ended his suffering and a lot of people were telling this uh prophet that it was too bad that his son was in hell when he had served god his whole life the people in the world weren't saying that we are so sorry that you have lost your son we know you loved him we know how we would feel so you know we we are having compassion for you we really are caring about you and we'll pray even people who don't pray will tell people we'll pray that's the world saying that most of the body was saying they're burning in hell and that was the first time god taught me about the difference between suicide and ending your life and ending your suffering he said when you're not in your right mind control of emotion whether it's emotional physical or mental you're not in control of your own emotions you're not you cannot think clearly or make decisions you just know you cannot suffer any longer so you end your suffering and he said those people go to heaven he made me go to the dictionary which he does many times uh he has me gives me scriptures in the word but he also says to go look in the dictionary to see what man says about it he said go look up the word suicide and it says willingly knowingly intelligently taking your own life he said but what most people are experiencing that's not that's not what they're doing okay a suicide bomber or a terrorist that is real suicide they know that their life will end and they purposely go do it because they know usually to bring violence or hurt to someone else to make others suffer is usually what suicide is about so these these bombers are coming bomb strapped on them they're intelligently making this decision oh yeah i'm willing to do this to take the lives of others they committed suicide but people who either through accidents or mental stress or emotional uh when they get to despair when you reach despair it's like sickness that they can't handle any longer so they're ending their suffering it's not that they don't love you it's not that they don't want to live anymore they can't stand the suffering and i literally was caught up to heaven and told that and the father said you will tell people about that and i had people say don't say that how can you say that i went would you like to go stand before the living god and have him explain what this means and then you say i'm not going to say it and they go well maybe not and he said this is going to help relieve the pain and agony that people have been put through with the loss of their loved ones who no longer had any control over their minds or their thoughts or their will and he said those people i would be unjust and unrighteous especially if they knew me i would be unjust and unrighteous just to give them to the enemy who actually destroyed them and he said you let them know they're in heaven they're with me and so he actually did this because of that young man because of what happened to him and what people were saying to this this prophet god said i'm going to show you where his son is this person was visiting our church i was doing hospitality for him when he came and i actually had bought all the stuff to put the food together and in the parking lot of my church she caught me up to heaven and i saw this miss this man's son i think he was probably in his 20s and i didn't know anything about him and i saw him standing in his father's mansion that was still being built and there was a trophy on this mantle that said satan zero god won and that was because satan didn't get his son and he said you're gonna go tell him that his son is with me in heaven and then i and this went on for a while he caught me up a second time he said i'm going to show you what he's now doing now and i saw him putting equipment on on this horse he was going to go backpacking and up a trail ride up the mountain spices and i saw this at the foothills was this huge mansion that he had come out of that i knew was his father's mansion and so it was this beautiful amazing place all made out of stone living stones not just stone there's nothing normal or plain in heaven there were this whole place was built with living stones and so i saw his son and he was talking i can't wait for my dad to get here one day man he's going to be so excited to find out there's some other way to hunt animals this is going to be exciting this is his first time going up there by the way i'm sure he had some other thoughts about that but but he that's what he was doing us i put camera equipment on the stuff on this this beautiful horse there was another horse with some other stuff on it so if you want to camp you can still camp in the mountain of spices without fear of anything attacking you or getting lost because you can't get lost anywhere in heaven you're in heaven so this is where he was going he was going on a hunt he was going on a hunt and i saw him the whole time see they talk about you all the time in heaven they talk about all the fun things you did the things you love to do together you still get to do those things in heaven and so he was excited about his siblings and his father knowing about this this hunting trip he was going on and so he's starting up the mountain of spices and i see these creatures almost transparent peeking around some of the trees and they had a scope camera well he was hunting now they were hunting him [Applause] and the father said hunting will take on a whole new meaning so that's how i learned about that that they do that in heaven and so i saw him i'm doing i started doing other things i saw him another time in his mother's mansion which is right next to his father's mansion and on the walls of that mansion i saw siblings that hadn't even been born yet i saw family pictures of the i knew who the father was i recognized the father i didn't haven't really seen his wife anywhere and you know when he traveled or whatever but i saw the father the mother i saw him i saw another sibling and i saw others that hadn't ever been born yet god knows who he's going to send and while this is this is exciting i know how many more she's going to have and so you have precious things captured memories and things put in your mansion so if you ever wanted to take a photo and you missed it and said man i wish i had taken it the angels take it they print it they frame it and they put it in your mansion [Applause] and i had to give up that gift to do this that was my gift i am a photographer so he used a business person to do all this i'm the ceo of a company he used a business person to reveal this stuff he likes business people they think clearly they're not afraid to make plans for the future they they make sure that they line on everything to see what they need and that it gets done they make sure the people they hire have the gifts and the things that they need they have strategies they have excitement they have creativity they don't mind connecting and contacting with other people no matter what they believe they're not afraid to go talk to people so business people like his son master carpenter and paul the tent maker and luke the physician all them they were in business so you need to be in business i'm serious god in this day will have more entrepreneurs in the body of christ than in the world or you'll be a part of a business or company that's headed up by somebody like that it's coming and so i saw the stuff going on and so i went and wrote everything down i saw and heard i typed it and i brought it typed when he came to speak now i didn't get to hear him speak because i was in the kitchen i was hospitality and i was preparing all his meals and decorating the room he would eat in and i went up to my my pastor and i said um this is what got my pastor knew i was going to heaven all the time and i said oh i said this is what i saw and he said you need to give this to him they need this word desperately it changed their life forever because number one they didn't believe what anyone else was saying about their son being in hell because not only i did not know this but they actually lived their actual home is in the mountains and the thing that they did the most together was hunting now i didn't know that about them at all and so god already see that's this is the evidence he gives that their loved ones are doing things as they always did down here and i didn't know any of this so this is what they knew that i had seen their son and the wife was so healed she wouldn't even go out in public anymore because of the accusations and i want you know what the body of christ needs to stop doing that no matter what happened or how it happened you need to have compassion on those people because if it happened to you you would want compassion given to you amen so yes there's all kinds of fun amazing things to do in heaven and they are never bored they are filled with the light and the love of god they're excited about us about us who are on this earth right now because this is our time to shine like the stars in the heaven where even when we go outside at one point the night will be like light about us the word says that we're that generation that will experience that i know that the word says there will be a generation which is a group and type of people that will be on the earth that will taste of the powers of the age to come the next age after this age is the millennial age and the powers that will be present then for the people is that they will live to be hundreds and hundreds of years old christ will be sitting on the throne his life will permeate the entire earth just like back in the ancient days in the old testament days you know they lived to be five six seven hundred years old so when christ sitting on the throne it will begin to change the earth heal the earth there will be many millions of natural people on the earth that didn't take the mark of the beast nor did they die in the tribulation and people will still have children in that time in heaven you don't have children but if you never had one god has a place in heaven called the reserve of babies if you never had one you can go pick one out it'll be you will be its mother its father you can see it grow step into its destiny its true destiny is to use the gift god your ultimate destiny for everyone sitting here not necessarily what you do for a job aren't you glad it is the gift he made you to be so even when children go home to heaven they will not miss their destiny their destiny has not been stolen from them because their ultimate destiny is to grow up and be the gift he put in them their gifts are their gifts and callings are irrevocable and they will step into that and use that in heaven so if you're if you're one of those who's lost a baby or lost a child or a youth don't sit there and think that their whole life was taken away from them they're living in the most glorious place having the most fun they've ever had with friends going all over heaven without parental guidance isn't that the best of the best going places doing things with jesus he has all of your children he has all of your babies they're filled with life they laugh they play even they get to create things the greatest levels of creativity and technology are in heaven and some of those technologies that i saw in heaven are literally going to be in this earth because this is the time for heaven to invade the earth people are saying things they don't understand how powerful that is what they're saying heaven is coming to earth heaven is invading the earth do we say that on earth as it is in heaven is one of the most profound statements anyone is making because that's a lifestyle it's a culture it's not just sounding good your will being done on earth as is in heaven is a culture it's a way of life called heaven culture so we who are alive now get to live in a way never lived before because this is the time where we will manifest demonstrate speak to the earth the sky the sea it'll be healed because of the glory we carry we'll step into time and go forward in time we'll see things forward in time we won't be bound by time or space because christ wasn't and everything i say will point right back to him the things he did we will do but you have to get your head get your head and put it on the shelf and open your spirit realize he said greater than so he actually saved the best for us to do so get off your rapturog roll it up and stick it in the closet the holy spirit laughs every time i say that because that's the first place i heard i heard him say it to me when i was saying were people trying to figure out and figure out in their natural mind everything that was being said i said you don't get revelation that way your spirit receives the things of the spirit so if you're if you're sitting there trying to figure out the first one you missed all the rest of them revelation is sent by god and there's different revelations he sends for certain times on the earth so you're hearing new things you've never heard about before or it wouldn't be revelation so i'm not going to be normal i'm not going to look normal i'm not going to say normal things that would be the same oh samo and god's not old he is new all the time so if you're going to hear about heaven it should be things you never thought of or heard of before but not just in heaven but on this earth the greater works he's not coming to rescue people and take them out here we haven't even done the greater works we're still trying to do the first works so god has given revelation on many things that we know are in the word but we don't necessarily have understanding so he's revealing mysteries i love his mysteries when he gives me one i get someone done like a little kid why didn't i see that why didn't i think of it that way why didn't i see it that way and he said because your thoughts aren't my thoughts but you can have my thoughts and you need to walk in my ways i didn't realize how many times it said that in the word even in the old testament he was telling people you need to walk in my ways you need to know my ways because they're not man's ways his are different they're unusual they're amazing fantastic life-changing they'll get you undone just like isaiah got undone i know how he felt when he had that experience you have no words to even say anything about it when you stand before him when you see that throne you see the living creatures massive and huge with thousands of eyes in their body and in their wings worshiping them continually the throne room is round the throne goes up like this like a pyramid with different levels and the throne is at the top that's why satan stole that image yeah almost everything he's told anything he says is his he stole it that throne goes up like levels and there's columns and levels and columns and levels but all goes like this and the throne is high and lifted up and there's four sets of steps that go up to the throne people are all over them gifts are all over them for the lord and for the father just gifts thrown up the steps the river of life flowing down these steps people are laying at the bottom drinking it sometimes he floods the throne room with it and you're swimming in it sometimes he opens the throne room floor and you literally see the river of life that goes down the streets of gold and then people jump in it it's a structure there's rooms under the throne that are under the altar where the souls go in there and they're under the altar crying out and we've always pictured them like here's the altar you know i know what altars look like and i've always pictured people crammed underneath these altars like how many can you fit because it says they cry out under the altar but that's because the altar is up here by his throne and there's rooms that you go into under the throne and even people go in there to clear over their families and people go in there and they they declare they worship they they say things over their families they bless their families but there's people in there always crying out for justice and if you ever walked up the steps of the throne they're very high very wide i clearly can so clearly embedded in my mind is the word justice like this big it's one of the steps of the throne justice is one of the biggest things we're going to get in this time as the body of christ justice against what the devil has done to us for generations and generations and generations [Music] to unseat him from where he put himself the righteous have learned he has no right to be there we were given dominion in the earth he was not he took it christ won it back for us so we're supposed to be like him we're supposed to be different we're supposed to be powerful we should be fierce against the darkness because the violent take it by force not the lazy not the ignorant not the ones who don't care the violent from the time of john the baptist that wild man who was shouting in the wilderness repent of your sins you wicked people the kingdom of heaven is a hand repent and get baptized in water do you know how weird that was you talk about bizarre at least i don't wear camel hair [Laughter] what time what oh no but my husband has threatened to buy me a camel costume so every time someone says god does not use pink hair i show up with the camel okay would you rather see this or the pink hair i've had many pastors say god does not do things like that he wouldn't do that you know you need to know him more because i know what the word says and at least he's not trying to tell me to walk around naked for two years sleep on one side turn it over sleep and cook my food on dung pink hair is a lot better and you know what they can't fight against the word i think john wore camel here is that correct well that was for that time no and that way god never changes he always does weird things to his prophets because he doesn't hide them he makes sure you don't ever forget them this is a marketing ploy for heaven right here and it works i get people saved on the plane in the airport security check-in tsa i get favor all the time in the airport because i declare i do people even the security people walking through the airport recognize me now they'll walk past me really quiet and they'll just kind of edge me over like they're going to interrogate me or something they do they come up with their badges and everything they get me over where no one kisses them they go so what is god showing you from heaven and then they'll just walk with me wherever i'm going they're walking me so uh it's okay um and they'll say i know you're busy and i know you got a plane to catch so you can just talk to me while we're walking while we're walking it's quite fun because they recognize the pink hair you can't hide one day this will be normal because heaven's invading earth and everyone in heaven at one time or another has highlights in their hair if they have a big celebration in the throne room everybody puts highlights in their hair they do it with light think really hard about doing that it's heaven culture because it's strange but i can't tell you how many people have said i love your pink hair and it opens a conversation about jesus christ that they didn't expect so i leave them in their soul with words they never expected to hear that he asked me to have this in person so the world would know he loved them and so i'm not bashing them or accusing them or threatening them i'm giving them life and they will never forget that [Applause] and guess what it's too late to escape because the anointing's already going into them and the anointing breaks uh so pink hair let you really see anointing green hair blue hair purple hair whatever they even put diamond dust in your hair in heaven it's beautiful isn't it and some people are so afraid to receive revelation and yet or they want well i like a cafeteria it's a cafeteria i'll take these revelations but these are just too wild i don't want them this is just too far out no i don't think that's god and when you miss him when you do that because if he's anointed someone to speak on his behalf and they live what they speak you should pay attention if they're sharing deception or if they're living unrighteously trying to tell you things from god i wouldn't take anything from them because their their souls been twisted either to live in deception and believe it and share it and you can tell deception they always end up by saying that you don't need jesus christ no matter what they start with it's an anti-christ spirit all the false religions are an antichrist spirit but the deception that is so released now into mainly into the body of christ because the world doesn't care the world wouldn't need the deception they don't know christ anyway so he's hitting the body of christ with deception and it sounds really good and even plausible because people can take the scriptures and make anything out of them and it can appear that it doesn't matter whether you sin or not you know or that god loves everybody so much the earth and the fullness thereof is here so he's taking everyone to heaven they'll actually use that scripture for that that's not what the word says or they'll say there is no satan there's there's beings like him but there is no real literal satan well then jesus was blinded when he was encountering them on the mountain of temptation he talked about him he was kicked out of heaven there is a being and i've seen him also and his eyes are filled with death but he's not red he doesn't have a pitchfork or a pointed tail i think that image is to make him look sort of like a cartoon but he's not he's deadly he hates everyone even his own demons he hates them he loves nothing or no one and his greatest desire is to take everyone to hell so we need to be fierce about winning people of course but in this day we have a greater revelation to do things in more powerful ways and accelerate it like be free stay free of everything by losing stuff from your soul the keys to the kingdom which you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven you don't have to keep not even a care if you realize that you're having a care you've been being concerned about stuff and then it goes into worry and then it can actually turn into sadness or even levels of grief or despair you don't want that in your soul so if i even realize that i'm sad i will loose that sadness from my soul i won't keep it you don't have to keep it we cast all our cares on christ one of my favorite scriptures another one is luke 2 52 and jesus increased in wisdom and stature in favor favor favor favor with god and man is that what it says yeah then we need to be doing that don't we when we take the word as truth absolute truth and we begin to apply that to our life you'll see your life change even if you didn't have revelation on it and you just start applying the word not just reading it it's a life book it's a book the way to live your life but when we start applying what we're reading he then gives us revelation so we can go from glory to glory we have weapons we have been given spiritual weapons not earthly weapons we're not supposed to fight against people everybody say that we do not war against the flesh so why do we do it because we're listening to the enemy he wants to keep us busy fighting so we will never come together because then we will be deadly he wants you dangerous but when you begin to come together and operate and rule and reign we will be deadly to the plans of the enemy will crush darkness push it out of whole regions he's going to have a miserable life [Applause] i want him miserable i want him terrified he's been doing that to us long enough christ didn't walk in fear i love the scripture fear not take no thought for your life if he holds it in his hand and you're running after him then nothing can take you out of his hand if he takes you home you're still in his hand [Applause] it says the grave and death they have no victory right and people go well we'll know each other in heaven no no death shouldn't even touch you in your thoughts life should be there not death to be spiritually minded is life so if you're focused on life and living and giving life and helping people to live and be greater and do greater then death will be far from you i love what he said about john when he said what is it to you if i let him remain till i come back they couldn't even kill him he's a good example of living life and sharing life the first words out of his mouth was always about life and love his last great message love one another they didn't want to hear they want to hear mighty mysteries they want to hear more revelations of heaven but they brought him out on the litter what did he say love one another we need to do that more too the more we focus on living and being something and doing something for god we're agreeing with him when you agree with him that is powerful the world should see as powerful they should see us loving helping and caring one another even more than we do the world it says to consider those of the household of faith first does it say that then we need to stop fighting each other lay down your differences you're going to live in heaven you'll wish you did it sooner i'm speaking to the pastors not just the body you're the example of god in your church start acting like him don't put fear in your people don't tell them the end is coming buy see rations and run to the hills tell them to get rid of the rapture rug let god decide when that happens get your crown on start reaching out to each other and caring cross those denominational lines or just wipe them out completely [Music] when the fire god begins to hit you you're not going to care what the name of your church is [Applause] the fire of god and the fear of the lord will hit you at the same time you crawl on your knees to love one another because you can't stand up you forget what you were fighting about christ set a wonderful example of loving people especially his disciples he gave me a whole new picture of them god took me back and let me see a life a day in the life of christ with his mary man now this was like in the first year he was with them when he was still having to tolerate them the sons of thunder there was a reason why they called him that they weren't calling fire and lightning down from heaven they were creating it on the earth because they fought over pretty girls they were so full of themselves they liked themselves a lot and competed a lot even while they were walking down the road to take the truth in the gospel behind the messiah luke the great physician all his patients were chasing him down the road why did you abandon us you left us for him we need you you took care of us we need we need you we we need you to take care of us we're sick don't you care about us and they're all hobbling down the road after luke the tax collector they were throwing rocks in him you better duck they didn't like him at all so here's jesus with this these these people that god had given him you ever felt that way about the god the people god sent you god sent to you are you sure because i don't think it sounds like you it doesn't look like what i thought it would look like i have to pray even harder for my own staff can you open their ears so they can hear simple things [Music] then when you think you got it made they're all together he adds some more that were harder than the first ones he sent you and god said i didn't make it easy on my son that's why he ran to the mountain to be with his father all the time don't you ever feel like you got to get away christ's dead and on top of that his family was always pursuing him this is not what we thought you would be doing are you done when are you coming home they didn't want him for his revelation they didn't even want him for the miracles he did i know they probably never asked him where did you hear that that's amazing wow you raised the dad are you coming home to make more wine from heaven now we gotta work your carpentry business it's going to the dogs don't you care about it does this sound like family and jesus knew he was going to be about his father's business and he didn't go back home do you realize sometimes they actually lived with him when they traveled so it wasn't like just going down the road he had to listen to when they all got together at the end of the day and in the beginning what they said wasn't good i know when you live positively and deal with life and someone starts talking negativity it's like crushing you it says don't be the friends of an angry man there's a reason for that you're going to get filled your soul get filled with it well if you live with someone who's negative every word that comes out of the mouth is negative you begin to you cannot bear it okay i taught all my family to lose stuff you better lose it because if you don't i'm gonna know it if you didn't ask for grace for that day that's gonna show up too no wonder jesus had to be filled with god's grace as a child it says so in the word as a child he filled him with his grace god has grace it's the abundant life grace that's at his throne of grace christ came to bring life grace for eternal life but he also was allowed to impart abundant life because as a child his father filled him with abundant life therefore he can impart it but god gives you infusion with you can impart it he knew he's going to need that grace to live with those men and yet look how powerful they changed the world didn't they they became exactly what he wanted them to become took a while but they had it in their soul they saw him he was mentoring them for three years gave his life and so their his life into their lives and was excited when they began to travel through the spirit realm like philip and where john became love he didn't just share love he became love he was saturated with love that's why he said the one that christ loved he didn't even give his name sometimes he talked about love poured love into people all the time that's why people were drawn to him after christ was gone he actually believed when he went to the tomb you know why he was the closest one to jesus he would not be apart from him he wanted to hear every word he said oh wow i can't believe time went by that fast the closer you get to christ the more you're going to become like him we cannot lead jesus out of anything that we're doing you wouldn't have any rights to do any of this you can't be a commander but we can't because he was a commander we can't be a creator but the father and he both were creators we can be creators we are over time because they were over time we're over the weather because christ was over the weather he didn't mind demonstrating he was trying to teach his disciples to do that we can multiply food i've already done that at a funeral he has connected me too he's so connected me to life after death no one can ever tell me there's not life after death there's more life after death than you had down here that's why we have to live on earth as they live in heaven so people can see life in us [Applause] christ was the lord of hosts this is my last thing i want to share with you it's about engaging with the army of heaven i love the song we're supposed to engage with the army people think that's just too weird we're not supposed to have anything i've heard something you're not supposed to worship angels do you know where that came from back in the day when the angels were sent watcher angels were sent to help educate mankind god put them here because he had no one on the earth to represent him they had severed the relationship with god so he couldn't teach him himself like he was teaching adam he literally put there's a whole tribe of angels called watch your angels they all have flesh melchizedek is the head of that tribe he also is the father's personal high priest he has always existed he wasn't someone who lived on the earth died and went to heaven became melchizedek i know people believe that even some of the jewish tribes believe that he was someone who you know walked on the earth but it said he has no father no mother no beginning nor end so there's still mysteries we need to know about but the hosts were created to protect us to guard us to keep us in all our ways part of that taking power over all the part of the enemy is using the host of heaven that army was created by the father in detailed tribes fierce they become weapons they ship shape from their person into weapons when they go and fight the demonic but he didn't need them to guard heaven he was on the throne so why did he make them they waited for ages to actually do what they're created to do to be weapons in our hands they those weapons they are mighty they literally can get ahold of the strongholds and pull them down we rule by what we say by the way we live our life like christ did he was a commander and the lord of hosts when he spoke they did it does christ live in you if we do the works he did and greater works than he did those angels were created for this time and day we live in for those who run in the kingdom who live in the kingdom who rule in the kingdom in that spiritual kingdom there is a spiritual army at our call walking is a man a righteous man on the earth christ said to the religious hierarchy if i wanted to i could call the army of heaven to come and fight on my behalf are we joint heirs of all that he had or did then why would that leave them out that's good they are bored there was a time and day on this earth that god said that said from this point on they will command an army like my son commanded an army because they are joint heirs i have created them to protect them keep them and all the way till one day they won't even dash their foot upon a rock and nothing by any means shall harm them you can fight against this revelation argue about it this is something from the father you invite heaven's army to be your weapon like you invited christ to be your savior and by the holy spirit to indwell you heaven protocol you have to invite they don't just come on their own generally in the past when we all pray in groups they could come and do some things in general areas but this is the time for us to be fierce to be focused to crush the plans of the enemy to have power over every single power of the enemy and they are a weapon your weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds you need to pursue that you can say i don't want it and not do it but in this day of what's coming on this earth they will protect you and keep you i have not been attacked at all from the day the father came and taught me how to invite heaven's army as a weapon and then give them orders to bring destruction to the plains the enemy to pull down strongholds wherever i go send them before i go somewhere so that nothing will hinder me haunt me or get in my way you can think about it pray about it but i know about revelation you don't just hear it you do it the work of the lord you don't just hear it you do it when you rule and reign you don't talk about it you do it if you're going to be violent against the enemy you can't just keep it inside and go i'm so upset and angry you do something about it so stand up i'm going to pray over all of you father i declare and decree that these children of you're standing here today that you open their ears to hear clearly spiritual ears open their eyes their spiritual eyes to see clearly in clarity let them see the host around them let them see them in the sky let them see them sitting beside them let them see carrying out orders because they were sent from headquarters [Music] by the lord of hosts who was their chief commander because he was a commander we are supposed to be commanders god said command ye me he didn't say beg yes this is our father i declare they will stand up and they will command they will rule there will be destruction they will push back darkness they will handle the wealth of the wicked they will get revelation they will have encounters they will not be the same because we are a new creation we'll be a sign and a wonder to this world because we won't be normal [Applause] i thank you father as people today choose to invite heaven's army if you want to say i choose with my will [Music] to be like christ i invite heaven's army sent by the lord of hosts to be one of my mighty weapons to pull down strongholds to slash the platforms the demonic have been ruling from to bash the demonic throw them in a dry place because we're creating regions of light so father i choose not to my will to take power over the power of the enemy who's attacking me and my family and i command the host of heaven you go now as my mighty weapon to put down the stronghold of the enemy to crush their plans to open up doors to reveal the things of god to let god be alive in me go host make toast to the enemy amen hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] amen let's shout again thank you jesus that was a new sound did you hear that that was a new shout out on locked warriors your unlocked warriors have a seat real quick 

[SPECIAL]Kat Kerr URGENT PROPHETIC AMERICA: OPERATION RESTART | April 21, 2021
by Sermon For You April 21, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLANiArcpU
or https://youtu.be/kBLANiArcpU
thought i would talk a little bit and then maybe jen could come up with some questions because you know we get them all the time either about heaven or something else but um yeah i'm so filled with god right now after doing that interview it was very powerful and so i thought i'd talk some more about the restart of america which is still continuing and i know some places is a little bit slower than others uh we're having really a great response from our governor here in florida so we're really excited about that we're praying for others who aren't really maybe getting the same response from theirs just remember on election day who you vote for next time and i just want to encourage you that that we're hearing more and more things are being reopened and then the reopening is being expanded to like more people able to attend and stuff like that i don't think they're quite ready to do mass crowds meeting together for big events and stuff like that so i'm sure a lot of people are being affected by that i'm sure that that was not easy for any of them and i know many people try different things like drive-by church you know online church was amazing yay dede and david in colorado at um up on lookout mountain they did a great job i think they broadcasted every single night since the quarantine happened they're still doing it and they're still doing it and that would be um gateway on mount zion gateway on mount zion online you can go yeah their facebook page or their website their website in uh yeah gateway on mount zion in golden colorado they're really powerful and i know there were many others who do that i just happen to know that they are one of them and let me tell you god is going to be really be visiting places it was a wonderful thing the day the holy spirit invaded our earth and let me tell you he is my best friend make sure you know him well he will share things with you to come he'll give revelation on the word of god he'll tweak your life all day long and jen and i both know he does that with us he'll even go shopping with you and tell you the best deals to get and honestly i'll even go to get something like i want to pick apples out he'll actually tell me don't get those get these other ones are going to taste better it depends on how much you open yourself up to him you know he's the third member of passing that's what god's been saying is just going to pass on and there will be no second wave he has assured me of that many times so i hope that encourages some people and i know in other countries people really also been praying to god for many things that they need help with and we pray for people all the time to be touched by god to be ministered for resources to come for help to come to different people and you know i know to some people it looks like utterly impossible don't say it's impossible you need to stay with god all things are possible and begin to thank him for the things you need if you've been praying and asking him that's fine but start thanking him for these things it says call those things that be not as though they were that means you talk about them like they're already here that's called faith so i want to encourage everybody i hope your faith has been increased during this time and i know this is something probably most people will never forget of course there'll be generations coming behind us that don't know anything about that but i think this has been a very different time and and hopefully the best part of you has come out during this time don't forget to pray and reach out to others there are many people who we may have less of things but let me tell you there's some that have nothing and my dad's heart was always to help those kind of people we spent years and years helping people feeding them finding them clothes finding them jobs finding houses for them that was just put in me and so that's my heart is to be help people be generous you know and sometimes be generous even when you need something yourself that touches the heart of god when you give out of your own need it really does touch god's heart and i know that right now he's got great things prepared for all of us i just finished saying that in our interview with steve schultz of elijah's i'm going to encourage everyone out there if you are not signed up to elijah list.com you need to go do that because he has the proven prophets you'll hear words from prophets some you know some you don't know and then you can watch and see what god does once they have spoken and declare things he's had me on there several times just discussing things prophesying things god has said and he won't let people come on there if all they want to do is bash and bring doom and gloom and death and destruction this is not the time for that to happen in this earth these are the greater days of god and so i really want to encourage you keep declaring that the restart operation restart will be fully taking place and that people will be able to go back to somewhat of a normal life i hope it's not going to be normal as far as god is concerned i hope you've increased your relationship with your family and with him and then get ready for some awesome things to begin to happen for all of us and that we also pray for people in other countries god i thank you for helping to bring supply to those countries that don't have supply we speak against and take authority over any of the virus right now we won't tolerate the virus even anywhere on the earth in jesus name we are over sickness and disease we are not under it christ was never upset he was never controlled by any form of sickness or disease when he walked down this earth and you shouldn't either he didn't have to put up with lack okay with violence he didn't have to put up with um any forms of oppression or depression he didn't keep in him and he didn't participate with it and make sure you're saying that yourself there's people out there right now if you're oppressed don't tolerate it loose it out of your soul get rid of it don't let it control you don't let fear control you because this is not going to drag on for years and years and why am i saying that because i was in the grocery store the other day and the person just you know just ringing up my my supplies they were saying that their self oh i just think this is going to last for years what are we going to do we don't have any kind of a life and i said well that is not correct this is for a very short time it's going to pass and then your life will begin to increase again so anywhere i can give hope or encouragement to people i'm going to do that that's what we're supposed to do and so thank you for all your prayers and all you guardians i want to thank you so much for your support you have blessed our hearts you've blessed the heart of god every chance i get i'm going to make sure i thank them and we have so many more things coming we have other broadcasts right coming up more programs coming up right now that we're designing and creating so today because we have some extra time in the the studio is all set up we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and answer some questions i think jen has some questions that she can ask me we've been trying to figure out why the internet was sticking so and i do know you know that we've had some issues here techno you know with some of the technical stuff here that i don't understand yeah i don't understand that at all i just know that i know how to talk and so that's my part and we do take authority over and we're not towering the enemy getting in any of our systems frequencies technology whatever it is we're kicking him out in jesus name because i know people are probably out there praying now i'm in agreement with every one of you and so we want to have a great broadcast and a signal to be strong in jesus name so what do you have today jen for a question well i just asked everybody on facebook can i play the intro oh yeah oh we're gonna we're gonna do a short q a so we're gonna let you see our little intro we're gonna so okay we're ready for our q a but before we start i already have a question that i was asked the other day and jen just reminded me people are asking about our 2020 calendar i know the year is almost half over but this isn't just about the months or the days of the months this is about revealing heaven and these calendars we create are what god wants he wants to reveal heaven to the earth the spirit realm to the earth the host of heaven the army of heaven whatever it is he once revealed that's part of our job to reveal heaven to earth and so they want to know about our calendar because we've been talking about it lately there's some fun activities in there that you can do with us that interact with us and one happens to be this month that's how this whole thing started this is the calendar right here i hope you can see it it's called the world called heaven and on the cover is an actual picture of a place that exists in heaven we all know about hebrews 12 1 that talks about the great cloud of witnesses that are watching this from heaven this is one of the places they do that this is called the portal and they have them all over heaven people come in way here this is the doorway walk down here they walk up steps these are steps that go up here to this opening you can see the opening right there and that's where people look down in they can view the earth declare over the loved ones see things happening good things happening on the earth and they sing they go and sing to you on your birthday they they understand they get to see weddings and babies being born and all kinds of things like that so this is a beautiful place that's mentioned in the bible i was taken to that place and so this entire calendar actually that's what this is about and every month you see a place or a being that is in heaven and i'll show you one more and uh but we have special days we put in here we put some of our own days in here what is not in here is satan's holiday you won't see that okay we're not giving him any place whatsoever uh and so let me find one of the other places there's so many i want to show you this is just awesome and most of these places were places i personally was taken to in heaven here's one of somebody going home to heaven this is called the transport and this woman who you can see standing there with the red hair she was 90 in her 90s when she passed and when she stepped her spiritual body stepped out of her body this is what she looked like young and happy she's very happy those are her two guardian angels about to take her home to heaven and then over here you'll find an explanation at the bottom of the picture over here you'll find an explanation of what this picture is about so you you get understanding not just images and then like i said and at the bottom of every month we have a declaration that we make like here this one says heaven celebrates each time a believer comes home so you get this at the end of each calendar month we make a declaration like that for you so it's very exciting you will see places in heaven you never even dreamed were there we do still have some left but the reason people want them is because we have interactive days like we have a day we said uh tell people you know show us with you wearing angel wings and that was one of the days and but you have to use the email email address that is on the calendar for those interactive things we do still have some left so maybe for the next month or so we'll have some so you can find them on revealingheaven.com go to our website click on the store and you'll see this calendar there uh we are already in the in the we are already right now creating to the 2021 calendar and the one before this one which was 2019 was about the host of heaven we we revealed and introduced heaven's army into the earth because the father had asked us to do that and so there's many other things in here i'll show you one more this is called the hall of knowledge i'm not the only one who's been there there's these beautiful towers made out of emerald like they look like emerald glass you ride on roads of light through these towers and that you can learn all kinds of different things the books actually show you the book you would take the book out of the niche and you lay it on this little table and it opens up and shows you like a movie of what's in the book this is heaven this is not the earth so if you're

bit of information from a question that we got so what do you have next jen um i have a question from eagle eagle and um they asked can our loved ones visit us in our dreams how can our loved ones visit us in our dreams the loved ones from heaven eyes and right yes that happens to many people people have very vivid dreams and i would have to say absolutely that does happen god speaks to people and visions and dreams it says so in the bible so that is possible for you to have a dream or even a vision of your loved one in heaven and actually some people have been caught up to heaven while they were sleeping and didn't realize that and they have very vivid dreams of being in heaven with their loved ones so you know with god those things are possible but absolutely that is possible for that to happen and sometimes it will happen like right after somebody passes away um i've heard of some people just appearing briefly in the room and waving sometimes they don't say anything sometimes they just say i want you know i'm okay or i love you and i think that depends on getting permission from the father for them to get permission from the father to do that i know people are so undone and overwhelmed when they first get to heaven their whole head and heart is just trying to take in that glorious place of splendor in heaven and of course the relationships they have with people they are meeting the father and the son and holy spirit just seeing the beauty that's there the things you prepare for them their own mansion they're just getting undone it's like one gift every time they go somewhere else it's something beautiful but yes i do believe it's possible to have dreams and visions okay um i found this question almost quite well not really humorous so it's it's a good one it's from dawn and she said cat do angels ever mess up like when someone gets in an accident or something is that them maybe not paying attention or slacking off on their job lol just always wondered about that i don't think it's about an angel if an angel messed up it wouldn't be something to do with rescuing somebody or protecting somebody i think so many different circumstances issues in our own lives you know the enemy will try to attack anywhere that he can make sure you're declaring and decreeing against that happening make sure that you're involving the army of heaven in your life um make sure there's all kinds of things so i have to say for sure angels don't mess up on something that would be that important they probably you know you have to realize these are real these beings have real personalities like you and i they all have souls they all have emotions and so i think sometimes maybe they're not quite getting along especially on an assignment i think they would get maybe a harder assignment given to them i do know sometimes that does happen i don't know how often but like i said some people have stronger personalities some have really fun personalities i know that there's some angels that are almost like comedians and there's others who are very focused and fierce against the enemy and that whatever their personality is that that's definitely going to come out in their assignments that god gives them of course they're answerable to him the thing about being an angel is nothing is hidden god definitely knows everything that's going on with them and they live with him so i think he has to handle that stuff and i know um we always have new people that come in or people that haven't heard you talk about stuff and people who've heard you say this stuff a million times but it's like certain people need to hear it and i really feel like um i want to ask this question this is from pam and she said you may have addressed this already please forgive me if it's a redundant i am a nurse you've mentioned we will do the same work in heaven there isn't any sickness or lack in heaven we all that um i know i've done on earth uh let's see what will i do for papa god if my job won't be needed well it's not your job it's not your job that you do in heaven nobody has a job it says actually says you labor no more what you do for a living is not what you'll be doing in heaven unless you've been using the gift he put in you let's say someone who's a recording artist and they're singing and they're so anointed they will be doing that in heaven but they'll be doing it for everybody in heaven for free so it's probably your hobby or something that is your passion uh maybe even though you were a nurse and you took care of people of course there is absolutely no sickness in heaven whatsoever they don't need lawyers doctors nurses there's all kinds of things they just don't need them in heaven because that stuff doesn't exist there but somewhere in you he put a natural gift not a job okay those are skills i'm not talking even about skills skills can be learned but a gift is something he puts in you and that's the thing you love to do the most that's how you can tell what it is it says every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights that would be you and when he made you in your little spirit man he placed in that spirit man a gift whether it is an artist whether it is a dancer whether you're going to sing whether you're going to grow the best flowers ever whether you're gonna make the best i don't know chimichangas uh donuts whatever it is the culinary arts are absolutely i don't know where that came from somebody probably likes them i don't like them whatever whatever okay baker's bakers are loved in heaven because let me tell you he gives you your own shop everything you make it all make all the wonderful stuff there's no gluten free no weight gain i can just go on and on yeah none of this stuff you don't have to have keto you don't have to eat keto stuff at the same time and so they're let me tell you there's fried chicken there's pizza i've been to a pizza parlor and haven't had ice cream cones and everyone that's their gift because that was their passion on the earth and they knew that it says your gifts and your callings are without repentance and he will not take irrevocable means he'll never take it away that means if he put in you to be an artist yes and maybe you never actually had a gallery or anything like that but maybe all you want to do is sketch you're a great sketch artist maybe you you understand colors and stuff like that maybe you want to make pottery with your hands but you don't do that for a living but it's your passion that's your gift it's what your passion is maybe it was a drummer and one grandson he started drumming on everything before he was a year old we knew he was going to be a drummer guess what he still loves it that's his gift when he goes to heaven one day he'll be a drummer that's not a job you don't have to labor it's not something that you don't like it's not something that's hard it's like breathing you love it so much so guess what and all that i do and all that jen does we are photographers my gift is i'm not going to be a revelator in heaven okay i'm not going to be a prophet in heaven i'm not going to be those things i'm not going to be any minister i'm not going to do that i will be a photographer why because i love it it is my passion from the time i was little i'd make fake little cameras with a box and pretend i was taking pictures until i got my first camera and i have never stopped loving it i already know in heaven i'll have a studio come by and see me one day when you get there i'll take your pictures for free and create beautiful stuff out of that so that's what you'll do whatever your hobby is whatever your passion is it's in there somewhere that's what you will be and all your property will be designed that's why there's amusement parks there's rodeos there's all kinds of wonderful fun things there and every time someone comes home to heaven there's something new and exciting to do but they're not working they're not laboring it is the most fun they've ever had in their life so there that's a good answer for those people who don't know they keep sitting on the pew their church this is what god says all my people keep sitting on the pew of their church trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is and yet the thing i want them to know the most is what is their natural gift that i made them when i sent them to the earth because when you get home to heaven that'll be the most exciting thing you do there yep okay one more what's one more okay um i've been screen shotting questions okay um back to uh the when you were talking about the angels um this one person didn't quite understand her her name is i want to say remy home um she said how could they not get along there is no evil in the angels so i guess she does she thinks they fight no no no i'm not talking about fighting like evil there is no evil there is no hate they don't do that in heaven but they have personalities everybody has a personality okay and you have to understand angels are spiritual beings we're physical beings okay we both have a soul but we have to make our we all get to make our own decisions because you're a believer and you're going to heaven doesn't mean you always you don't ever have disagreements with people okay there is no anger no coveting there's no jealousy in heaven there's no wrath nobody fights nobody hits somebody nobody does things spiteful i'm not talking about that kind of stuff i forget sometimes to relate things my answers to heaven culture and not earth culture so your mind is thinking earth culture earth atmosphere earth living it's not like that in heaven but not everybody wants the same thing even in heaven but they still agree to enjoy their self to have fun you still have your favorite things your favorite colors in heaven that god doesn't take all that away from you but there is no anger no wrath no hating no spitefulness no coveting there's no offense that part that part of your your flesh emotions because right now we're spirit man but we still have our flesh when he talks about your flesh lay down your flesh right that's not talking about you dying as a person that's talking about your opinions your rights your attitudes your anger issues that's the flesh that stuff is not there but people still have their personalities their likes or dislikes and sometimes when angels are sent on assignment god on purpose and this is why he does it there's no marriage between the angels they don't get married on this earth we get married and one of the things that he does with marriages sharpens the husband and wife that doesn't mean get you angry enough that you divorce but it stretches us right it makes us to come into agreement on different things sometimes you know we have to give a little take to get you know we have to come together in agreement even as husband and wife but it stretches it says steal sharpen steel that's what happens when you're married you sharpen each other you make each other care more understand things aren't going to be perfect but you're you're willing to work it out in heaven they don't have that so god has another way that the angels get stretched right and he sends different personalities on assignment and i happen to know this is true because two that were assigned to me for a while one was a comedian the other one was so fierce against darkness he wanted to talk about being holy he wanted to talk about crushing the enemy that would be satan his plans the other one wanted to make jokes because he was funny his personality was totally opposite of the southern angels they stretched each other every time they were with me they didn't get angry each other so forget about the anger thing that's earth thinking but angels have personalities in heaven and they like many different things and they have friends amongst each other no romance okay they don't happen in heaven um the angels who fell tried that it didn't work so that's what i'm talking about when i said you know it's not like your flesh getting involved i'm talking about on the earth when you loosen stuff from your soul get grace for that day and you work through your things you don't get offended you don't get in wrath um because we have help from heaven okay one more next question angel question and then i have a question i have a 13 year old um wow melissa wants to know do we have the same guardian angel our whole life yes you have the same guardian angel your entire life at the time you are conceived when life begins life doesn't begin when a baby's born life begins the time of conception and from that moment your angel your guardian angel or angels are sent from heaven they are will you your entire life they are the ones who help bring you home to heaven when your body dies and your spiritual body steps out the first one you will see normally will be your guardian angels and they escort you home in a transport all different ways you can be taken chariots you can be taken to heaven they will be with you the whole time awesome okay um charity's 13 year old daughter her name is i want to say lyanna but she would like to know can we ever get kicked out of heaven no but he's going to get kicked out of heaven that only happened once and that would be satan and all the angels who fell with him they were the only ones who'd been kicked out of heaven all right they decided to go against god to try to take over heaven that was a long time ago and so he was one third of all the angels in heaven how about that that's crazy chose satan chose lucifer as their new leader and they all got kicked out but no one who goes there you're not going to get kicked out of heaven okay when you step out of your physical body with your spiritual body you already whatever things whatever issues you had whether it was anger against somebody or you had issues maybe you didn't even like yourself all that is gone okay those things you don't carry up to heaven the people you cared about the gifts he put in you to use that stuff remains with you and excitement adventure and all kinds of wonderful things are in heaven but you can't get kicked out of heaven because when you receive jesus christ as your savior all the stuff all the sins in you get wiped away like they never happen don't let the enemy remind you of your sins if you repented of them all right now even god can remember them because you told him that you were sorry for them and so i can assure you that no one's going to get kicked out of heaven okay and um this is another one you've answered before but i love to hear you talk about this um erica's brother she didn't say what his name was but he wants to know if there is hunting in heaven this is a fun answer actually that's why i asked it i think you know jen knows a lot because she's heard so many probably she's probably heard every single time i went to heaven and for those of you who don't know me yes god has never stopped catching me up to heaven yes he can do that because he wants to no i don't choose to go myself this is all free for all of you so you understand god caught people up to heaven in the old testament it says so he caught people up to heaven in the new testament without dying and he still does that because he chooses to and so she knows just about every time he caught me up not in this physical body it would stay behind you catch me my spirit man my spiritual body that looked just like me but a lot better and so what was the question erica's brother now if there's hunting in heaven is there hunting in heaven you'd be surprised what god has uh has in heaven but it's the way he does it this different okay almost everything we have on the earth is in heaven except there's no killing no no harm nobody gets injured uh none of that happens in heaven okay so um i'm getting distracted today is there like are you seeing angels well there are angels all over in here right now okay of course i could get distracted just by the one that's behind me and the one who's two on here the one standing by you the one standing by chris okay the one's sticking their heads with the ceiling looking down and the ones looking through i'm gonna figure oh yes because you know i don't really want to hunt maybe well no we won't say that i don't hunt i don't want to hurt anything maybe mosquitoes there's hunting in heaven but this is the way god does it because nothing gets killed remember what i said no creatures are killed all animals are called creatures in heaven they all talk they all have actually uh amazing personalities but you do go to the mountain of spices that actually exist in heaven and what you do is a camera shoot you're capturing the image and they actually have a clubhouse in this whole place and you will be hunted by the creatures with their own cameras while you're hunting them and your goal when you get to heaven is to be the first one to get their picture which is sent back to this huge clubhouse with like a 40-50 foot screen and down in the corner is the one who captured you and on the screen is the one that was captured and so all these people i actually saw people in heaven doing that they had you know pack horses and they were packing all their camera equipment on these horses they even have different type cameras that look like sort of like a scope thing and when you some of these creatures are not anywhere on the earth by the way so you're really hunting something that's fantastic but more times than not when you get back to the clubhouse you will see your face plastered all over the big screen and in the corner will be the creature who captured you by getting that picture first so it's very intense because while you're hunting to find the creatures to get their pictures it's a camera shoot remember you're not gonna hurt anything but how intense is that hunting process when you're looking for something that's never been seen before and yet they're probably smarter than you they hide to you and they get you first when you go back thinking wow i know i snapped that picture and you walk in the clubhouse and there's your face plastered all over you know that you were busted and you were caught not them but the intensity and excitement even increases more so in heaven but nobody gets hurt or harmed and no life is taken so you will still get to do that try your best if you can when you get there okay i have a um another question you've talked about before but um holy spirit really wants me to ask this so um do aborted babies and babies in general have their own mansions especially when they grow up or if not where do they live i brought this everybody everyone no matter who they are will eventually have their own mansion jesus said in my father's house that's a world by the way just you understand god's house is the world called heaven bigger than our galaxy and uh trust me there's plenty of room for mansions and when little babies go home to having every baby who dies passes leaves this earth with however you want to say it whether through abortion miscarriage or because they were sick or whatever if when they die and they go home to heaven they will know family members in heaven uh they will grow very slowly uh we've actually know of people who when they were 40 years old died on the operating table saw their seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold who died years before that but because they the the mother went in her spiritual body her son recognized him he still looked seven years old he was playing with friends on the streets of gold and he recognized her and actually told her you can't stay you have to go back but god allowed her to see her son number one he was well and whole he was happy he was playing he had friends and his mom came back of course she survived her operation and for years her and her husband would travel around the world and tell people about the beauty and the love of god that their child was still waiting on them in heaven now she's already home in heaven so when the parent comes home to the baby they actually get to take the baby from the nurseries and i have a picture here's one of the nursery walls that i saw in heaven right here and i gotta make sure that the lights not reflecting tilt it down oh here yeah there we go that's good if you can see that these are some of the babies beds that were on this nursery wall i saw now they weren't sleeping babies don't have to sleep in heaven but they have these beautiful like a little niche these are little tiny babies most of them and the angels give them a nickname unless the parents have named them and they grow so slowly birds come in and the birds take them for rides around heaven all kinds of fun things for them to do they can sing laugh dance and god has this beautiful place for them and they will be there until either the grandparents come home or somebody close to that baby in relation they get to take them and keep them to the parents get there the parents take turns raising them and eventually they grow they step into the gift remember we talked about gifts they each have a gift whether it could be anything designing um it could be like music it could be art it could be dance it could be culinary arts it could be creating all kinds of gifts and things for people making things out of gems i know they have jewelers and things in heaven whatever their natural gift is they'll still use that in heaven they'll step into their gift and eventually they will have their own mansion when we come home to heaven we come home as god's son or daughter and all those babies will be growing in the most beautiful amazing place loved by jesus himself and fun places that he made for them so your babies know who you are they definitely can't wait for you to get to heaven so that was beautiful you brought that jen okay um this question is from jan vincent and he wants to know if you can practice christianity and witchcraft no and what if you you cannot claims that he pray for people and heal people with jesus name but yet also do witchcraft stuff i will tell you what the bible says there'll be some people who go there one day and jesus will say depart from me i never knew you you cannot practice evil and say you are a believer too you cannot do both when you become when you practice witchcraft you're partnering with satan even the bible talks about that it was called necromancing in the bible and it's all evil it belongs to satan witchcraft controls and i know that one day they'll actually be people that are called themselves good witches there is no good witch and i've heard from some of them myself and let me tell you when you partner with satan he will lie to you deceive you but you cannot you have to choose one or the other because christianity you believe in jesus christ as your savior he does not tolerate witchcraft he never practiced witchcraft he spoke against witchcraft even himself in the new testament so it's wrong it belongs to the enemy and this is a thing people will get healed in the name of jesus it's jesus's name healing them but that doesn't mean they get reward for that and the bible says will be people who come before god there's also people who say they're a christian but they sin in bad ways they sin but they go hold meetings people get saved they'll get healed they may get words from god because that doesn't stop operating you the way you choose your own life to live and what you personally choose yourself will be demonstrated by the way you live your life that means you can't be a witch and you can't belong to jesus you have to choose okay because when you die whoever owns you or you serve will come to get you and if you're practicing witchcraft that gives the enemy the right to come and get you when you die so i would not mess around with that get witchcraft out of your life i pray for people to be delivered from witchcraft spirits that doesn't come from god so don't play around don't read books on witchcraft don't go see movies about witchcraft you're opening a door in your soul for the enemy to begin to control you and these people who think they can be do both are under a great deception so i'm just saying there's evil people people who are doing wrong sinning but going and having meetings people come they get saved by the name of jesus they get healed by the name of jesus they get worse because the holy spirit is going to speak to those people it isn't that person okay don't follow people who you know are sinning don't do it because you follow jesus christ those who believe the word of god and live the word of god there's double accountability for leaders and so he will hold them doubly accountable but it says one day when they come before him and want the reward there will not only be no reward he will not allow them to remain okay so you can't you can't do evil and do god you have to choose god you cannot have evil in your life and witchcraft is one of those satanism is witchcraft any false religion don't try to practice two religions at the same time any witchcraft and you don't allow it in you make sure you're running your race to make a difference for jesus christ it says for us to be like him he didn't practice any of that he actually spoke against it so those people are deceived there you go okay um this one's really long but i'm not going to read the whole entire thing and uh again you have discussed this but um this is from charity um herself and she says she has such a struggle with being you know you can share on this experience i can share on this i absolutely can share on this and number one i want to let you know this god does not approve of any violence no abuse okay no kind of abuse whatsoever whether it's physical abuse verbal abuse god is against that and and let me tell you this that he would rather you be by yourself than be with someone who's abusing you i know that many spiritual leaders through the years have said uh and it can happen on both sides okay i'm not saying i know women that were violence and abuse their husbands and i know men that were violent and abused their wives it happened on both sides so you can't say one is worse than the other abuse is abuse okay uh but for instance let's just say for instance i had prayed for people before they were under severe abuse and this was a wife and she was abused physically all the time and when she went to her pastor they would say you cannot leave your husband the bible says you cannot do that no that was not the right thing to say to them okay god does not put up with abuse he doesn't approve of anybody abusing anybody you certainly have the right to not be abused and this is the thing if it is sin let's just say it's sin if we say it sin sins can be forgiven if you divorced and it wasn't out of abuse when you just divorced you didn't want that person you you divorced them you can go before god and say i repent of that that doesn't mean you have to go back to the person you're already divorced your pen is wiped away sin is wiped away people you can't hold those sins against people not even things they did 30 years ago if they repented of those things then god doesn't remember them anymore and i happen to know myself personally some people don't like me after i tell them this i went out and picked out somebody it wasn't god's choice this is what the bible says and god came to me himself one day and i was abused horribly uh when i was married to somebody else and god came to me and said how long are you going to put up with that and i said well what should i do about it he said you have a contract you don't have a covenant he said my word says what god has joined together let not man put asunder what that means is don't let man end it he said if if god put it together if it was god who brought you together and then again even if you did and you repented for doing that later it's still forgiven okay people don't like it when i say that sin is sin if you repent it's forgiven no matter what kind of sin that is it's it says that he remembers it no more he's not going to treat you like a lower human being okay god's not going to do that i'm still pursuing my destiny i repented of that and uh god said end the contract so we i got divorced because god told me to he said you'll never be who i need you to be if you remain married to that person i didn't bring you that person that is not my choice that's not a covenant a covenant is when i bring you together i didn't look for anyone god brought me the husband i have now we've been married 43 years and let me tell you a marriage is a trial it's a trial it's a challenge because you've got two individuals coming together as one maybe you like different things you do things different ways make sure that you're marrying the person god has for you and even then there could be conflict but make sure you're praying for each other i'm just going to include all this in this package that's not just a yes or no thing now yes or no abuse is as bad as running around on your spouse it's still abuse that is mental abuse if you're married and you go find someone else and sleep with them and you you choose them over your spouse and you're still married and all this is going on that is sin that is for sure sin but it's abuse god puts abuse in that same line that says that talks about adultery in that home meaning is severe abuse and that's what he recognizes even in the bible that you can be divorced if that happens this is a very touchy question but i don't mind answering it okay i suffered a lot of abuse but put up with it for six and a half years until i finally said to god what do i do and he said how long are you going to tolerate it i had to repent to the person i married i didn't even love them i had to repent to them i'd repent for them that that had to be ended because god had asked me to end it so there was repentance on my side and then god brought me the right person and i married them because he said you will marry this person so people can fight and argue and yell all you want to it's about what you repent from if it was wrong what you did it's been ended and it's over and maybe the other person is remarried he certainly doesn't expect you to go after them and make them remarry you you repent for the whole situation give yourself to god and he probably most more than likely will bring you somebody else to be with you god doesn't want us to be alone okay and the reason why he has marriage is so we don't have to go through this life alone it says the marriage bed that means you know what that means that means a living together having physical relations when you're married god approves of that when you're not married and you live together and do that he does not approve of that and there's many reasons why because when you come together you're actually sharing your soul with each other this is more than you ever thought you were going to get this is what happens when you ask the deep questions okay and the more of yourself you give when you're married you're empowering each other but when you're not married and you're sharing physical relations with each other you're giving parts of your soul away layers that you shouldn't be doing that to someone you're not married to so there's your whole story it's all about abiding in god married they're christians and they marry someone who's not it's a much harder lifestyle if they don't want to agree with what you're doing maybe make sure you find that up before you get married but i can tell you that if anyone repents they are forgiven and you can't drag that stuff up and throw it back in their face again because what you that is then wrong okay you have to forgive too even it was something that was done to you that that unforgiveness will hurt you worse than what you experienced before in your life get rid of all unforgiveness and all offense no matter what it was and you run your race and let god bless you and so there's that very long answer about that question but god doesn't tolerate abuse in any marriage no physical abuse no mental or emotional abuse that beats you up until you feel like you're nothing at all he doesn't want you to stay in a situation like that okay he doesn't and so uh pray let god open doors of safety for you and you seek him to see what you're supposed to do next but he does love you there you go so um somebody actually asked me a question oh wow jen what did they ask you they wanted to know if i've ever been to heaven okay so come over here and say thank me if they ask you then you give them their answer hey i'm kind of in my gym clothes still it's okay everybody looks like that right now anyway so i've never been to heaven but i have had um three open visions uh during the time that i was writing the the first children's book and well two times were with the first children's book and then the third time was during the well well i've been writing the second but he did something special for you didn't he yes um when i was writing the first book i wrote one sentence down and i was in my office and my whole office went black and then my wall kind of opened up like a movie screen and i it was like i was seeing the book come alive so it was all in cartoon form every time i've ever had an open vision about heaven it's been in cartoon form that's cool and so i was seeing the characters in the book and walking down the streets of gold and um one of the times that that happened they were going into the amusement park which kat talks about in her first book and i was seeing all kinds of things um and things that i had never heard her talk about and so it was like i was walking with them i didn't see myself on the path but i knew i was walking with them seeing my characters walking down the streets of gold and going into the amusement park and one of the things that really fascinated me which is going to be in the first kids book is i saw a merry-go-round and instead of uh the horses that you sit on there are actual live animals and they were whole the the people children adults and there were even some animals writing on there so it looks like animals it was quite funny um but they were riding on the backs and they had rains and then instead of their little platform yeah instead of a pole being down the middle um they were on a platform that would go up and down and i had never heard her talk about i didn't know that and so i was so excited it went in when the vision was over i come running out of my office to tell her what i saw and and she's like yeah that's up there so um and there were other things that i saw too and what what were some of the well or some of the animals you could write on jen not what you would think yes it is was um dinosaurs there was even a whale so apparently somebody had always wanted to ride a whale i mean i guess it it wasn't huge so it shrunk down to fit on the merry-go-round but there was a seahorse that didn't need water to breathe no it didn't it didn't and there was uh jungle animals uh you know like elephants and lions and real ones yeah real ones breathing ones and it was really cool and uh there was like a little raccoon that was on the back of i think it was like a hippo or something it was so funny but um yeah and they like lollipops don't they yes the raccoons like yeah yeah because they even saw a raccoon riding on the rush yeah so that that was my experience and it was it's happened three times now yeah and uh so yeah that'd be awesome yeah yeah that was a great answer i'm back over here now okay maybe a couple more questions so that we can we do have a couple more things i have to do today but how much fun is this to just have a just a spontaneous q a session and now you find out some people can see heaven and cartoon form that would be really cool so oh let's see and so when you see like you know teal squirrels or or purple elephants yes that exists in heaven everything is different colors in heaven i love when you talk about the messenger squirrels yes that we're talking the greeters the breeders i've always called a messenger squirrels they're greeters they sing and dance with top hats the squirrels when you have a party somewhere in your home yes people have parties and they come to entertain and they have top hats and canes and some of the best dancers i've ever seen and you you you just you know get home and say hey we're having a party we'd like for you to come do some some of your performance you never know what's going to happen up there it's just great so what would you say to someone who's been praying and asking to see jesus and angels and it hasn't happened yet i would say um stop praying and asking and start thanking him i'm real serious about that because it happens at the most unexpected times and it's usually not when you're asking i'm just gonna give you a free little tip and many times it's not when you're praying either most of my encounters i have in heaven is not when i'm praying somewhere i'm not even reading my bible i'm doing everyday stuff and he catches me up and sometimes i'm doing everyday stuff and then an angel walk up walk up and say something or i'll see them doing things or um so you have to just understand you think if you don't get in some spiritual position of what you think would be proper then it's not going to happen jesus also visits me when i least expect it and so i would just say expect have an expectancy that is going to happen you know and i you know maybe share to people i'm expecting this to happen and you'd be surprised how soon or quickly it happens then well i know the first time i saw an angel which was um um the one that was watching uh ben do the shipping and receiving yeah we've seen i was working at my desk typing right here in this room and at the core of my eye i just see this most radical looking angel leaning he's just like like this watching him pack up the products to ship out and i was like okay and i just kept on typing you know what even the angels love it that we're sharing heaven and all of our products represent something about heaven or living righteously or being dangerous against hell all of the products we put up for that reason and we we do have mp3s now we have dvds cds mp3s we have photographs we have artwork now we have calendars we have cups we have all kinds of stuff we're creating um to to demonstrate and manifest heaven like here's one of the cups right here i have one it says i don't do demons and there's a little lightning bolt representing when they were all kicked out of heaven you know then once you follow loose for that's what that lightning bolt represents some hell doesn't like it that we market stuff like this because it points fingers at them anyway so we do all kinds of things so angels are going to be present even if you don't see them they're present if you're speaking on behalf of god when you're praying they're there your angels always there maybe turn around every now and then say thank you for watching over me that's perfectly okay you're not sitting down having tea with them however if god allows it enjoy it we're living in a different life and time now and i know that before the end does come which is generations away it will be normal for you to see angels in your home and angels in your car outside your car because they're there all the time i see them and i know more and more the spiritual realm and these are spiritual beings in the spirit realm the spirit realm will be more and more visible in our lives so you live in a great time okay you live in a great time and great things are about to happen in this earth even in the midst of everything else god has his plans and so i would just encourage you we'll probably take one more question and that will be it for today and you never know when we're going to show back up again yes i i hope that you're enjoying this time with us and uh even though it was unplanned i love spontaneous spontaneous still happens in heaven okay okay and so uh well we'll let jen um okay share one more question um okay this might take a while but i know we've discussed this before that's okay someone wants to know i don't i don't didn't see who asked the question but someone wants to know is the virus the mark of the beast or the the vaccine the vaccine it's the mark of the beast uh we we've had this long conversation about this everything is many years something comes up that is the mark of the beast yes and i have lived along with you and let me tell you they were doing it back in the 50s oh i was alive oh even mom it my our mom who was born in the 30s she was born in the 30s they said even back then they were saying that the rapture was coming the rapture was coming you know you know what he says about all that just so you know revelation 21 the very end of the bible okay the very end of the bible there's so much still that has to happen the best of things other than christ being born him dying on the cross tearing up hell wasting hell okay those were amazing powerful things the holy spirit coming those were great times but we're entering into some of the most powerful exciting times as a believer that's your life that's the what you what's coming for your life okay but i can tell you the mark of the beast is nowhere right now there's nothing that's been created on the earth that is the mark of the beast at all in any way whatsoever it isn't the michael chip oh no they used to say the bar code okay when i was going to the barcode you're going to walk around with a bar called this big on your head right that was going to be the mark of the beast this is the crazy thing i will say this the mark a mark is a visible mark you will see it a visible permanent mark you will see it with your eyes it's not something hidden in your skin it's not something that will happen or a frequency that will be around no it's not the 5g it's not 5g people this is what god said about 5g that just means the gospel will go further and stronger than ever before around the world around the world which is his purpose so don't look for the 5g to be the mark of the beast that can't even happen okay the antichrist is not on the earth the spirit or the attitude or the nature antichrist means anything that's against christ himself anything that speaks truth and hope is and then that is the that is the truth but anything that speaks against it is an antichrist spirit jesus said even now the antichrist spirit is in the earth he didn't mean the person he met the way it will operate he will speak against god the antichrist will be against jesus christ his holiness his sovereignty it will speak totally against all of that that that stuff is going on but the antichrist himself has not been born how about that one people he's not on the earth because he couldn't operate in his fullness with the body of christ taking authority over the earth ruling and reigning on christ uh changing things speaking to things it wouldn't be able to be here he couldn't be here in the time when the antichrist comes the whole world will be falling apart millions of people will be missing off of the earth it will be a horrible experience for people and he will be their their protector he will be their savior the antichrist will have answers for all that stuff he's not here that stuff is not happening so no the mark of the beast is not out here somewhere but it will be a permanent visible mark and satan will make sure people want to take it back in the days of that happening and you will see it walking down the street he can't force you to take it people because it would defeat his purpose his purpose he wants to flaunt that people want him and they they want him to be there so this is not the time for any of that it's not the time of the four horses of the apocalypse it's not the time for the wormwood whatever to hit the earth it isn't time for death and destruction it isn't it is the time for the the knowledge and understanding and the operation of the glory the power of god seen going around the earth in these days there's baptism in fire that will burn all the fear out of you all the world out of you okay that has not happened yet okay the manifested sons and daughters speaking to earthquakes to make them stop and put it back the way it was before it happened or anybody died that's a manifested son or daughter raising the dead that were cremated that's a manifested son or daughter are you seeing that it's not even happening but we have to have this in the earth because she said it would be here and the wealth of the will the wealth of the wicked has to be transferred to the just and the righteous those things haven't even started stop asking if the mark of the beast is out there stop asking if this is the end and everything's going to crash and just be blown away it isn't and i have news for you the earth won't even stop being here until after the tribulation is over and it's done and gone they'll still be natural people on the earth jesus christ will sit on the throne in jerusalem for one thousand years when all of that is done and gone many of us will be in heaven okay and then the earth then jesus will be king of the world for one thousand years will be no wars no weapons will even be used saint will be in the bottomless pit just falling he will not even be on the earth there'll be no evil on the earth at the time there'll be people who don't want christ on the earth so you can see that even at the end of this age we're in which is still got quite a few generations to it the next age after this age will be the millennial age so the earth will still be here it'll still be operating it says people will still be getting married and being given a marriage so don't try to make god's will be pushed into a little box of what people have told you it will be this is not the last day this is not the perilous times where you can't build you can't eat there won't be anything to do you'll barely be able to breathe you won't see blue sky you won't even be here during that time you are here during some of the greatest days on the earth and i'm just going to end with this because it is so powerful to understand god's timing he has things in his own word he wrote if they're still in some of the newer bibles i hope they leave them in there the perilous times have not happened the tribulation has not happened it will not happen for quite a long time your focus is to know christ to have an intimate relationship to speak hope life create things invent things give people hope for a future not demon gloom okay god himself the father is the only one who decides when jesus comes back and he is too busy ruling and reigning with us okay so look for greatness look for god's plan for your life run after it don't sit him on the curb somewhere make sure he stays with you no holy spirit and know that you are chosen to be here now you are not chosen for wrath we as the body of christ have not been appointed unto wrath so we won't be here there will be people saved during the times of the tribulation those are other people who were not christians before that happened okay you focus on what he wants right now which is he wants you to be great for him in the earth bring hope and life watch your words watch your choices but live happy make sure you have fun because heaven is half fun and half powerful it's so filled with splendor glory and awe of god fun as a weapon against fun is a weapon when you're having fun the enemy doesn't like it so make sure you're using confusion too yes it confuses his head because he can't understand why he's not keeping you crushed down all right run after god himself and let god take care of all the rest of that stuff don't look for the mark of the beast it's not going to come in the letter it's not going to come in an email nobody can send it to you nobody can put it on you they can't force you to take it so you're not even in the generation that will be a part of that that means you are here to do powerful amazing things with him let your faith build trust god regardless of what's going on yes i've been through hard things before my life but i trusted him even when i had nothing i trusted him and believed his word and i told him i did bless his heart bless your angels heart by declaring the things of god it'll change the atmosphere where you live choose god choose life be powerful in the earth for him and we will see you later right jen [Music] yep [Music] you

for the heavens to be ripped open come on amen absolutely and uh you know well we love you we're going to be with you this weekend and so we're going to talk about this conference the washington glory major very soon so i'm so glad you're here on the show and and miss catker no introductions needed a one and only how are you doing ma'am welcome welcome i'm in a constant state of excitement right now that's what i'm doing i'm i'm feeling exactly what they're feeling in heaven they're excited about right now and what god's doing right now uh will touch and change this world for the next 100 years you know i'm just going to throw it out there because that's what the father does with me i can just tell you this is very key very important a lot of people maybe get trapped on the side about you know maybe violence or this going on but i can tell you god's got his plan and he's going to work it and it's going to be amazing and i just want to add this about the northwest did you not know the places that are the most significant to god are the ones that are attacked the most by the enemy and that's why satan wants to keep that area dry because it is like a wellspring i'm not just a well but a wellspring and i'm telling you god is going to explode from that area and come from that very corner of uh this country and flood all over the place so just stay excited everybody and don't miss it don't miss this event that's gonna happen wow that's powerful because uh you know you're talking about wellsprings and really i want to talk right now about the wellsprings of revival i believe we are in a season where god is re-digging or digging up the old wells like in the days of isaac yeah and he's also digging up new wells the old wells and the new wells and of course right now we're in the month of february it's it's my favorite uh month of the year why because it's my birthday month so welcome to february everybody but of course in this month uh catherine coleman passed uh billy graham pass john paul jackson bob jones and paul kane so i really feel like kat and sherelle did this season god wants us to dig up the old wells and the new whales of revival in america because we're in a new season now i want to ask you miss cat what do you think about that word and what god's doing and digging up the old wells and the new wells right now well i do know this that he's definitely in a generational thing right now which means the generations of the past and everything that they did and made as a foundation is going to explode in this in the generations of this uh time on the earth and those who are alive on the earth it's going to really it's going to accelerate everybody forward and upward and so yes i definitely agree with that the things that the people lay down their lives for i love it that in the month of love you know god took all those mighty men and women home and i actually knew bob jones would go home the father told me the birth of february and taking bob home on the 14th and he said it's going to open up whole new portals whole new gates all over this nation and he said so everybody needs to be excited and you know but that was several years ago but that doesn't matter god builds on things he knew everything that would happen and yet he's still gonna do everything he wants but this is what we'll have at the end we will have great victory and great celebration come on absolutely and i'm just being reminded miss cats of again bob jones prophetic word when the kansas city chiefs win the super bowl it will be a sign of world revival of the end times billions of harvests and of course last year the kansas city chiefs won after a long hiatus and it was a sign of course column drum you know uh you know with the dates and the coach and all of that but right now the kansas city chiefs are in the super bowl another time for the second consecutive year in a row awesome and i feel like again this is a double double sign double for your trouble sign that god is raising up the apostolic chiefs in america right now yeah you know and again i just love what you said miss cat that that mantle of the prophetic and of love of bob jones and of the kansas city prophets it's really coming down right now so strong yeah um wow my gosh and i i just want you miss cat if you could just pray into that right now in this moment because february is a month of love like you said but it's a month of mantles and a prophetic glory invasion can you just pray one thing one more second um the double thing totally goes into all of this because god started talking to me about the double uh divine decade divine decade uh and there's a double there's the 20 20 to 30 and the 30 to 40. this is going to stretch that long in this in this on this earth a lot here in america but god i thank you father for having your will your way this day that we're going to just skyrocket in this month of february god that people will see your love in our lives but also the true prophetic follow those with the true prophetic word god will step forward they may some be unknown some known but i know this is your time in the earth for for people to know you and to hear your word your true word which will excite people it will not be human gloom at all it's going to be your power your love your way in this earth and so by the way thank you for that and we come against anything of the enemy that would interfere or stop or halt or delay any of that in jesus name we say no more we command the host of heaven to go ahead and pull down every stronghold of satan trying to stop anything in this event keeping anyone from being a part of it we declare your power be seen and heard in this earth through the mouth of your prophets god we thank you for the mantles to be awakened god and those even carrying them to be brought alive in this time i thank you this is your time on the earth and we agree with your plan wow amen and amen absolutely i i feel like right now because of where our conversation's going i feel like we need to talk about what is god doing in this month of february what is god going to do in our country and in the nations of the earth that i just feel such an expectation and an anticipation because february is going to be a mega month of miracles so let's talk about that right now and i want to pass to mike in the florida prophetess sherelle what do you what do you sense what do you expect god to do in this month of february in this season right now well it's it just blew my mind that as soon as you guys got on here you started talking about the wells of revival i don't know if you guys know about a prophetess named fuchsia pickett but she was a prophetess back here in the 70s i believe and she i was reading some of her book last night and she was talking about how wellsprings of revival were going to burst up in certain areas of this uh of washington and this area over here and so i began to see a vision when i was reading that and i saw the lord show me that there's been like holes of revival in the grounds of the earth here and some people have sown seeds of faith and they've prayed and they've prepared the way and revival has come up to the surface a couple times but man put his foot on the coals man tried to stop the move of the holy spirit and what the lord is saying to me about these next few months is that we are going to be led by the spirit the spirit is going to lead us man is no longer going to lead the spirit and it's i'm i'm excited i just feel like the holy spirit what the lord showed me in 2017 he told me that the holy spirit will be given a platform and that's what we're seeing in this season a place that is cultivating revival by letting the holy spirit lead amen and you know just uh just to piggyback on that you know really the next three months i want you to hear these words because the next three months there's going to be monumental momentum that's going to take place from now passover i wish somebody heard me today from today february 1 to passover which is of course in the middle of april for the next three months there's going to be mega momentum monumental momentum that's going to shift you into harvest and into miracles so there's going to be a lot of setup for financial miracles miracles in your business and even salvation in your family but from now to passover begin to prepare because there's going to be mega setups for your divine breakthrough now before i pass the mic over uh to the woman of god cancur i just want to read the scripture because we're talking about whales because i believe god is springing up wells right now in the spirit genesis 26 18 isaac reopened someone said reopened which means it was closed but he opened up again isaac reopened the wells that had been dug up in the time of his father abraham which the philistines ding ding ding key were philistines which are enemy opposing giants the giants of the land the giants of welfare of poverty of socialism the giants of human trafficking of the elitist the philistines had stopped the whales after abraham died and so right now these giants of the land of 201 are trying to stop the wells or stop the flow of your finances stop the flow of the holy spirit stop the flow of revival but god wants to anoint you to dig up and open up again what has been closed by these philistines these opposing giants and god's going to be doing it from today february 1st all the way to passover so you watch god's about to open up miss cat what are your thoughts here what do you want to say to the people right now i i have to say exactly what the father is continually saying to me don't we don't lose that um that spirit of celebration and maybe you don't know this people but celebrating in heaven is mainly what they do it's one of the ways they worship god it's one of the ways they are are thankful and grateful to him for all the things that they that he did for us while we were on earth and also once they get to heaven and so they are celebrating in heaven already and i do know another prophet uh hank kuhneman who always talks about january february and march that leads into april and he is almost in line with what you're saying he says that january will begin to bring justice february will be all the fireworks of the beginning of everything happening and then marching into the end of the march will be great celebration and miraculous so uh that's what he has heard from god i can tell you that i continually hear that justice is already beginning to be served and all the stuff that's going on and just let me add what the father just shared with me yesterday about all the stuff going on we know that those who are now sitting in seats of authority are illegitimate that's what the father says is illegitimate power in other words not power given in the natural not power given in the spirit you know the whoever is the head of a government it says that when the righteous are in power the people rejoice but when it's the wicked and the evil are that great the sadness comes upon them well i need to remind everybody that right now those who are in authority don't have power not real power which will be shown and proven when that great victory comes and god will shift back what his intentions always were and the truth is this the one who is in true authority even right now yeah which is trump he is actually a president he did win the election and he is the one in authority still welcoming god still having plans by the way he's still getting ready to work plans i just have to let you all know that and it's beginning to be no secret that that's happening so there's a lot of people right now in dc very afraid demons are leaving dc like crazy i mean they're just leaving racing out of there and this is what god said that is because it's illegitimate power so those who are righteous right now they are still in power they're the ones in power and what he says what our president says the true president says is what will affect this cup this country not just in the natural but in the spirit realm this is what the father says the wicked and evil trying to rule they have no power no true power so they have no right no portals open to them to allow evil to flood this country like people think is happening i'm sorry but the devil isn't going to be taking over because there's no true portal or opening you have for that to happen that is shut you should be rejoicing everybody because this is going to be an accelerated thing that begins to happen with the revival going into the habitation of god in this in this country and all over the world actually so these are celebrator times these are victorious times these are not times to be crushed and to be sad and to have fear in you about the only thing the devil's getting away with is bringing fear all those regulations and all those laws being made illegal illegitimately will not stand yes well this is why you should be celebrating because we will have the ability to move unhindered all open country as god moves and does the victory thing and you will see it with your eyes everybody will see it with your eyes this is why it's so important to come to these events right now to get filled up to get excited to begin to make plans with god himself about what your part will be in this so this is a strategic event you don't want to miss this this event because this is god's time to bring in that double decade the divine decades uh back to back in this in this country here and it's going to be so powerful your life won't be the same we don't want it to go back exactly the way it was we want it to be greater more powerful in god that we will be more accelerated forward and the law will flow in this country especially between the body of crisis was really needed first and i declared that that love will be released because the other can't be hell can't be released right now people if you get me in the spirit room if you were a or you would understand it's leaving hell is leaving and so that leaves those who want to be in power power less they won't have the effects they won't have the enticement they won't have that uh the captivation of hell and evil although it's already in them it will not be released or lose throughout this land because there's been no portals open because the one in true authority is not allowing it come on that's so good and of course the wells are actually portals because wells one more thing there are these massive angels some of the hosts have already been sent to some of these wells and they have these swords probably they're 15 feet high swords and they're like standing there like this over them about to hit them when we declare something at this event they will hit these wells these drywalls and they will literally be open and they'll shoot on springs so this is a specific event planned by god so this can happen so don't miss being a part of uh having those wells open can i share something with you really quick uh that's what i was seeing in the spirit when i was beginning to pray and see you coming over to this area i saw you just taking a stake and driving it into the ground and it just broke open this area and i saw the wells begin to bubble up and the the springs just begin to spring forth throughout the earth in this area and it just goes all the way from this side all the way down into the east coast and i just believe it's going to start something here in this area that has not been done before i'm so we are so excited well absolutely the convergence that happens when the right anointings and mantles come together and and times uh you do not receive a breakthrough because there's an element that's missing but i believe again us coming together especially with miss cat especially with the now anointing and the now word that she carries sun is gonna break open in the pacific northwest so listen people of god you need to be there at this event i mean we're pretty much sold out i don't know if we can do overflow open up the doors and have people just sitting outside we may have to do that honestly because we're already sold out uh but you know there's going to be something powerful that's going to be released that's going to affect all the regions of states nearby i guarantee it i believe witches are going to come to jesus yeah people who are in new age are going to be delivered okay to warlocks weekends people moving in the dark and black magic and dark spirits they're they're going to feel the tremors of the wealth opening up so it's going to be powerful um you know again as we're talking about all this again what god is doing in america right now on the earth what god is doing from now february all the way to april passover and now specifically for this conference this event the washington glory invasion you know i'm just reminded of again uh uh john g lake how he started up the healing whales and the healing rooms in spokane washington and you know there's something supernatural that happens in the pacific northwest and i believe something's going to break with that mantle now prophet shirelle is there something you want to share with us concerning john g lake the healing rooms and that well of revival that's about to burst open i just know that we are getting close we have been seeing more miracles than ever before in our second service we had a man come in and walk out of a wheelchair i mean when taylor ran up to me and she was like mom there's someone outside in a wheelchair and i was going oh my gosh not a wheelchair on my second service but it was incredible it's just awesome to be pioneering here what has been in god's heart for so long and i just what i'm seeing is that this explosion that's gonna happen no man can keep his foot on it then the holy spirit is getting ready to explode in this area i believe we're going to see miracles like never before i believe we're going to see limbs growing out more blind eyes and deaf ears being healed but not only that families being healed god is calling whole families in this season he's calling the prodigals home and i'm so excited to see and be a part of this movement and it's like god is strategically placing people the right people together people that probably really never wanted to do anything like this i don't know about you cat but i was just minding my own business when the fire of god fell on me in my living room and he told me to go live on facebook and i was like you want me to do what so i just believe that god is raising up a remnant in this season in this hour he's the people that he's bringing to the hub here are just so hungry and they're tired of church they're tired of religion they're tired of being put in a box i took the box slacks last week and i ripped it in half and i threw it and i stomped on it during the circuit because i just believe you know when we're led by the holy spirit it's powerful yes it is we give him the platform and he does it all it takes the pressure off of us and we just give him the reigns and we say have your way holy spirit and i believe that's people like john g lakes that's what he did he probably surrendered his life to the holy spirit and that's why god used him so mightily and that's what we're seeing right now and another thing is i feel like you know um god's using the most unlikely people yeah and people that are not really that well liked people don't like cats pink hair people don't like my pink lipstick but i'm just being obedient to god and just saying use me lord i surrender my life to you and he's gonna he's gonna do something in this area that we have not seen we are getting ready to see something that we have never seen i mean what are the odds of the kansas city chiefs going to the super bowl for a second time yeah that's incredible well well once again god god is the god of the miraculous and he's the god of the double and the triple so i believe in the season just like prophet shirelle said that the unlikely the no names the faceless those that objected looked down upon i mean president donald j trump took took it by storm and he came totally from left uh from the left side from you know left wing but again it's those types of people where there will be a supernatural grace to be an apostolic chief like the kansas city chiefs god's raising of apostolic chiefs prophetic warriors in the season who carry the now word of god and who walk in signs and wonders yeah uh of course we're talking about this event uh you know we're all going to be together literally in a few days i know my cities uh talk to us what are you expecting for this event it's really not even an event but it's it's a family celebration it is because it's actually an encounter um yes god doesn't always call things events anymore he calls them encounters and those who are there or who choose to encounter what he's got those are the ones who will go away with it to use it to release it for him but something else about john g lake um i remember one time when i was i was under attack that was probably maybe 12 14 years ago when all that happened and i was heading to memphis to um release elvis's mantle to be completed because it wasn't completed and then he bought me every way i could that's how important mantles are they're so important and i i told my husband knows throw me in the back of the truck there was a double cab and margaret drove all the way there and we were listening to um billy brims tapes about had all those who had passed on before she had recorded things and i think john g lake's son-in-law was speaking and he was talking about um speaking in tongues and i'm telling you it started to get really hot it was so hot and all of a sudden the holy spirit said i want you to claim it and so he was speaking under the anointing of the lightning power of god that was one of the things john d like operated in it just blasts the enemy out it's still a part of the fire of god and god said claim your healing and i yelled i couldn't speak up until that point it said i i claim it and all of a sudden a fire came through the speaker hit me at the end of my feet when i went my body and drove the sickness out and i was instantly and i was on fire it started getting so hot in the cab and i know the holy spirit was just laughing he was so celebrating see because i out of an act of obedience i was just dared to do it and when we got to the event when we got to the this place in memphis where i was speaking about albus and why god called him and anointed him and was talking about that mantle then people ran forward to get prayer the holy spirit said impart the fire of the lightning power of god into them i'm like when did i get that and he said you said you received it and i said i thought i received him and he said oh you have the mantle of the lightning power of god that john g lake operated in and since that day i have used that lightning power god it destroys the works of darkness no matter what is about and i did it so much so many times john g lake actually showed up at my event there you could see by several people who were present and he was just watching me release the lightening power of god i can tell you what's going to be the lighting power of god is going to be at that event people and it destroys the warts of darkness in your life in cities and regions and i mean no guess what it's probably going to show up there probably john g lake that's where he's from and so expect the lightning power of god expect the miraculous to happen and i do expect things to happen that never happened before so it's going to be a power a power encounter of god of holy spirit of jesus of this whole area being least at least released into its destiny to bring the life and the power of god into this country and then throughout the world so this is a major encounter time on god's timeline so please don't miss being there because we are all a part of this when we come into agreement great power is released wow that is so powerful that's why uh you know as myself and prophet shiro we prayed about a title for this encounter you know uh the washington glory invasion because the lightning angels of course the thunders and lightnings from his throne are actually angelic hosts that are being released from his throne okay those angels are going to be invading and they're they're already invading right now those angels are going to be invading this time and i believe right now even from that event conference region to wherever you're going to be connected or watching from to be a new measure of power a new measure of these mantles a new measure of healing don't be afraid of kobe don't be afraid of vaccinations don't be afraid of what the world says there's a new wave of miracle working power and healing as being so we're going to tap into something it's going to be incredible i can't wait to just celebrate the lord and and

[Music] you [Music] thank you father for revealing heaven Thank You heaven for being present thank you for joining this assembly we thank you for a long is to participate what is taking place in heaven and bringing heaven to earth and then living heaven in this earth we thank you for this powerful time father that you have called the kingdom age when your kingdom shall come to this earth and we will live heaven culture which is on earth as it is in heaven so we thank you Father we welcome you we welcome all of those now watching from heaven we thank you Father for the presence of the hosts of heaven that are surrounding us and are in and out of this building continually this night god we thank you for a guardian angel God all that they have done for his father we thanks for watching over us for guarding and protecting what you have placed inside of us God thank you for helping us father to walk wholly in the earth God holy unto you surrendered father laying down our life and living it in your son we thank you for your son and all that he has done all he's made available for his father this precious it is holy I thank you for this holy time on earth god that we are all chosen to be a part I say yes Father I say yes to whatever you want whatever you need me to do whatever you need me to say wherever you need me to go God that I will represent you that I will represent heaven God that we are all forerunners in this time we're forerunners for the body of Christ father that you're changing our lives and changing our words because you have shifted us onto your timeline we cannot remain the same when we hear about the Wonder and the glory in the splendor of your home and then we carry that God it will take the knowledge of the glory around this earth many times over demonstrating and manifesting for you and the way he's never seen before experienced before we thank you God so we're about to stun this earth and shock hell as we walk in the shoes of your son and we run our race father the way you designed us to run it I think you got for stirring up every gift and every person here tonight God I think you've were given them witty ideas and inventions father this is your plan for now in the earth this is a new time we're going to be that new creation that you designed us to be will have new words to hear and share about you about heaven I thank you Father for this holy time we are grateful that you have revealed that we lived in you and you have sent us to this earth to love and live for you and to share truth and then take us back to you we thank you God that we will be in all of eternity with you it will go from glory to glory splendor the splendor the wonder of you inside of us I thank you for the father and everyone said amen amen [Music] wow this is an awesome atmosphere thank you for coming everyone the only thing I like more about going to heaven is sharing it I can't teach you how to do that I have a commission to do that I can tell you that he is catching people up all over this world and showing him his home for Christ said in my father's house are many mansions and I can assure you that his house is not a building it's not a platform somewhere in the sky it is a world bigger than our galaxy even bigger than that there's no way you can measure it or even understand how he designed it it's always been his home until the day he makes the new earth and then we all have a home together I don't know if you realize this he's actually willing to leave his own home to live with us Christ had to leave it when he became down-to-earth and he became flesh had flesh when he died on the cross the Holy Spirit moved his base of operations here because Christ sent him here and then one day the father himself will leave heaven and forever live on the new earth with all of us and that amazing that they had to be willing to do all of that for us that's because He loves you that's because you actually came from him everyone who ever existed came from him you didn't live somewhere in heaven you lived in him he was your very world the enemy is always trying to copycat but God has he wants to be God that's never going to happen it didn't happen back in the ancient times when he was thrown out of heaven when he was so convinced he convinced himself he had won he gotten a third of the angels on his side which still is almost it makes you undo that doesn't it they lived with a God who made them and yet they chose a creation over the Creator and let me tell you just because God didn't say anything Jim didn't mean that he didn't know about it but the more he deceived and the more God remained silent he thought that he had won he thought it was smarter than God and then he found out in a second he wasn't anything it wasn't anything he was kicked out of heaven all the angels were kicked out with him they can never be restored and I know you may hear people preach that one day God will forgive everybody the everyone will go to heaven he'll forgive Lucifer he'll forgive the fallen angels that will not ever happen their future is already sealed in the lake of fire they will not be anywhere near us on the new earth it says the former things when we remember no more in heaven right now though you give testimony of your life and the victory that God gave you on this earth when you get to heaven but one day none of the things that that were a part of your life without him where you will not even be able to remember them but I will tell you right now even on this earth will become so supernatural like him let's say this together God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the earth that's his plan for you so people say that we can't be like him they're wrong he would have never said that in case you didn't know after the likeness is the way they operate so he didn't just make you in His image he gave you things inside of you so that you could operate like him so who is he he's a creator right Jesus Christ as a commander is that right Holy Spirit goes everyone knows everything all at the same time Holy Spirit is an unlimited layered being don't you like Revelation he has unlimited layers of himself and every layer of him is a whole of him so ever he sends a layer of himself he knows everything everywhere all at the same time so for your information when you invite Holy Spirit to and well you you don't get a little piece of him he sends a layer of himself which is a whole of him who indwells you and that is what makes you the Temple of the Holy Spirit that is one of the most important things you can do up to get born again it's not even preached in some places right now you know because enemy is terrified of that happening to you because then instead of walking beside you it says the word when you get born again he comes alongside you is that right and he'll be there all the time until you caught up to heaven one day unless you do something about it unless you choose to ask him to end well you you have to invite him say we must invite say we had to invite Christ to indwell us we had in my Holy Spirit to indwell us it's heaven protocol and the reason for that is you had to make a choice you chose with your will to receive Christ and let me tell you we actually have a new CD called born again that the father had me just make it tells you what happened in the spirit realm what happened in eternity in the scrolls of time and the Lamb's Book of Life in Hell and inside your very being that made you the new creation what happened at that time at that moment in time and it's on this CD God born again it's one of the best witnessing tools I've ever had or ever made it explains why Christ why do you have to receive him what happens when you receive him what levels you can go after after that happens what happens in Holy Spirit indwells you what happens all around you what happens with the hosts of heaven what happens with your guardian angel this if you're not aware of the spirit realm the unseen realm I'm talking about the unseen realm it says everything that was made that you see was made by that which was unseen that means the unseen realm is the original realm not this physical realm this physical realm is temporal it's temporary that's what that means but eternity is in this in the spirit realm there's more activity in the spirit realm than there is in the seen realm there's it never stops activity never stops in the unseen realm not around you not around where you live not in the atmosphere not into the third heavens there's continual activity both from heaven and from hell and what you do in your life will draw one of the other to you that's why you need to sermon that's why you need a holy spirit that's why you need to pursue an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ there's a lot of stuff going on in this world today even in the body of Christ that shouldn't be happening there's a lot of good and there's a lot of God I'm not going to discount that because God is pouring himself more and more into this world Christ is making himself known to us every day of our life you can increase in that relationship with him because he wants that kind of relationship with you he's not sitting on the sidelines watching your life go by no he armed us when you were born again you got weapons you got the anointing you got Authority given to you because you are now a son of the Living God your son or daughter of the Living God and what you do with your life after you receive him is totally up to you but right now living on this earth are many that he called to demonstrate for him in the greater works that Christ talked about they're beyond your imagination to even consider or think you might actually get to do some of that like going to a funeral and raising someone the dead that was cremated [Music] I hope I got someone's attention everybody say that's a greater work people think well you know Lazarus was dead for four days correct that's in the scriptures he was dead he was thinking his body was stinking Mary and Martha were trying to show Christ it is too late and let me tell you Christ did not cry because the Lazarus died he said it was going to be okay didn't he yeah because he knew who he was no he cried because they didn't believe it they were doubting him he had said yeah he'll be resurrected yes we know on the day that the dead in Christ is raised he'll be raising who's trying to say no right now you know he was there right he knew what was going to happen let me tell you people in Abraham's bosom were shocked do we ever think of that how many people don't know what Abraham's bosom was let me see your hand it's okay if you don't know a lot of places don't teach that anymore before Christ died on the cross and descendant in hell and wiped up hell went up to heaven and poured out his blood on the mercy seat when people when righteous people died that God called righteous they descended into Abraham's bosom which was a spiritual abode God made for his friends they didn't sit on rocks it was a spirit round place it had golden buildings and had a sky and had a magnificent river and had Kings tables filled with feast for them to partake of and below that was hell and there was a great gulf between them this is what the word says and those in Hell inside the gates of hell you come up to the courtyard of hell you can see up into Abraham's bosom but she couldn't go there they could see them if they came close to there was like I'm trying to think of where my mind's not in the natural realm at all right now I like a balcony raining pink your Holy Spirit in this beautiful place he'd made for for him Isaac Jacob Joseph who raised Jesus right John the Baptist was there is that true yes because they were righteous they were accounted righteous either because they believed in God himself and they extended the faith for that when they died they went there they didn't descend into hell that was for the wicked dad but they could see each other at one point and so people in Abraham's bosom already knew the Messiah was on the earth as soon as Joseph went there they knew because he wouldn't stop talking about it if you knew that and you went there would you talk about it yeah he non-stop talked about it and then when John the Baptist went who was his cousin he confirmed everything Joseph said but he even knew more because he was there after Joseph he was still there living on yours after Joseph went and descendant Abraham's bosom so than John the Baptist was talking about him he actually saw him right he baptized him he wouldn't stop talking I have baptized the Messiah he is here on the earth he's here so they already knew any bands living the Messiah was on the earth so let me tell when he showed up there they knew who he was and he proved who he was because he himself left for the first time left Abraham's bosom and crossed over into Hell on his own because he had an assignment it was to take back our authority and our Dominion that God had given you know had given Adam and Eve and then they they sold out but you know what they were redeemed yester in heaven say yay Adam and Eve are in heaven how about that they made it so sometimes you don't really think about the whole scope of this picture and so as someone else came to Abraham's bosom they would tell them what was going on on the earth because they were new the new arrivals and it's just like in heaven when somebody newly arrives they'll chase you down they'll start getting you in a minute you come in the gate and you're still trying to jump in the river water like okay da da da da da you would have weighed about this what was it I heard this was going on what about this is this true now I saw something from the portal but they didn't know all about so why don't you why don't we go share somewhere they want to haul you off somewhere and share with you they want to hear what when hear what you have to say and later you're going to have meetings everyone your family members had to stand on a platform and share to the body of Christ living in heaven about their life how God redeemed and what was going on around them and then what was newly invented on the earth they won every time somebody new comes they want to know I promise you was the exact same and Abraham is bosom okay you don't get a chance to do it when you go to hell okay you have no life in Hell been there and seen it you don't want to go there there's people right now saying there is no hell they may find out one day their death there definitely is it talks about it in the word it exists it's there but in Abraham's bosom life was amazing it was beautiful they had feasts to eat you don't get anything in hell there will be no food in hell I love that one song that says they don't see they don't serve breakfast in Hell huh Jevon heard it I think isn't it uh it's called like my father's house in that the name of the song might and but yeah big big houses big big house and they are telling people you won't get breakfast in hell you don't but Abraham's bosom has more than nothing plenty they needed to enjoy their life they were always excited when somebody new came there and most of the time they didn't have to ask him they came there talking about it especially once the Son of God and the Messiah was on the Earth Day that was the number one subject they want to know about I know I was taken there I saw Abraham's bosom it wasn't some little tiny hobble on a rock people picture them sitting in the middle of Earth you know trying to escape the lava the spirit realm supersedes his physical realm that's why spiritual beings can pass through the walls they can walk through you your angel stands in you most of the time yeah they sit on you too sometimes especially if you ever get out on the floor if you're knocked out by the Spirit of God or the boy whatever it is it get you on that floor and you can't move your angel is sitting on you you can't even crawl I've been there I'd see him sit on me and they wouldn't get up and all I could do was laugh I mean I couldn't crawl I tell my family don't bother me until I can crawl up to the you know altar leave me there you'll find out one day everything they did ok for you into you but there was big news in Abraham's bosom about the Messiah once Lazarus came he was dead for four days where do you think he was he was the newest thing in Abraham's bosom and that man who was one of Christ's best friends knew beyond a shadow of a doubt who he was he would not stop talking about the Messiah and here he is like into a starting his fourth day there just going full steam ahead Wham they lost her nothing jerk they heard a voice Lazarus heard him he heard him calling him from there did you think he's going to say no one does it yeah later when I'm done oh he did not care okay he called him to come forth he came out of Abraham his spiritual body came at Abraham's bosom back into the tomb picked up his body and he came out of that tomb still in the wrappings and he wasn't stinking because he was fresh alive by the glory of God raised up from the dead to be a miraculous demonstration of the power of Jesus Christ which has been given to you and I you should see it that way we are joint heirs with him what he did on this earth we have the ability if we walk in and go after it to do that he said that we have the ability to raise the dead is right heal the sick raise the dead cast out demons is that right Trump is supposed to your rights with the powerless if you believe you got to remember that there are requirements to all those who believe right these shot designs shall follow them and so here was Christ demonstrating it doesn't matter how long it not matter if your dad you know you know no matter if you died right then raise him up know that he was dead for four days so we're going to do greater works that means it has to be something greater than being dead for four days he didn't mean being dead for seven days he meant when you were ashes I I was taken forward in time and I literally was young this is one of the greater works and Christ took me there and I saw somebody raising someone from the dead at a funeral that had been cremated and everyone in the funeral home Ryan down front Peters face on the floor I began to cry out to Jesus cry and I am absolutely what he shows me is literal he doesn't show me symbolic things ever he treats me like I'm a he says I'm going to show you so you know what I'm talking about that is something that will happen I'm sure we'll be go viral around the earth so the knowledge of a glory sometimes we'll go through the internet did you think about that that's something was watching over a few times isn't that people watch laughing dogs 10 million times and I want to point out no matter what tragedies and stuff are going on out there the laughing dogs top all the doom and gloom and the wicked evil stopped because people want something that they're going to enjoy so why don't you give them something to enjoy your testimony should be filled with glory power right victory that's the word of your testimony you overcome with that that's not the story of your doom and gloom and and ten hours of your sufferings that's a story a testimony is how you were tested and you got big tree and Christ gets all the glory for it he actually told me to help you if you're writing a book about your life make sure he gets more than ten pages because it won't be worth reading if you make people suffer along with you through your entire lives and yet can you give an ounce of victory that doesn't show them that they can overcome even during them in the midst of what they're going through you should have victory every day of your life because he delivers us out of it all so started giving them the victory the minute you step into something start declaring you have victory you're giving them the glory it's because of him not you that you are an overcomer because your words have power if you don't remember anything else remember to watch your words what do you want in your life what do you want your family's life what do you want right now in your life because what you say is what you're going to get the word says you'll eat the fruit of your lips that right whatsoever you will have whatsoever you say it loud you shall have whatsoever you I think that means your words are important he made me count my words woman 9 every time I open my mouth I had to think about what I was going to say he trained me to speak life and not negative not negative unless he shows me something that he has said I am to be aware of and to not be a part of I don't run around spending my life critiquing everybody else's life and pointing out all their weaknesses because you're not helping them when you do that you're not you need to talk about people's strengths their gifts right God's plans for them share the truth of them while you're doing it because they're going to open they're going to be open to you to speak to them if you're encouraging them not blasting them and I also know that you help the enemy when you blast them it's like you're part of the enemy's camp this is my assignment to tell them how wicked and evil they are how far they have fallen from God that they're walking in hopelessness they'll never have anything no that is the enemy's words that's how we talked if you hear that don't say it if you hear those words turn wrong go I know who you are and I'll have nothing to do with you you'll freak him out because most people just say what he says right so if we're going to be like Christ in the Earth's we have to be careful what we say how we live the choices that we make in our life your soul is said every minute of the day by what you say what people say to you what you watch what you hear and places you go your soul is going to be whatever this is the way God said whatever you enter into is going to enter into you that's a quote a quote from heaven what you enter into will enter into you that means in your soul and that's important because you are a living soul we've all said you know we haven't we you know we we we're a body we are a spirit we have a soul no you are soul you are a soul wrapped in your spirit man and you have flesh on your body so you can have dominion in the earth but you are a soul and you choose whether it prospers or not if you want to prosper and be in health then you guard what goes in your soul you can change the way you think the way you respond even what happens to you tomorrow by what you decide tonight to do with your soul you can't take your soul and set it on a shelf and pretend like it's something bad because when I grew up in denominational churches they always said the soulless realm is bad your soul is bad well then how come it got saved I was eight now we have all these big questions for people that didn't want to answer if I soul just got saved right he came to save souls right if I gave it to Jesus and he moved in then why is my soul bad I don't think anything bad I'm not looking to bad stuff I mean just owe me eight years old they made decisions when I was young I was going to be on the side of my parents I was going to be on God's side now it's going to help him he needed help so I really consider what I do in my life even when I was young I did so I escaped even though it's raising a teenager and the whole drug thing when it first came out by the way marijuana is bad no matter what they tell you that's from heaven he did not make it so you could smoke it I don't care if it is a natural plant I will preach it I grew up in that time when it first came well in my era when it first came people lost jobs they lost friendships they got sucked into LSD and all the other drugs I didn't do any of it I decided at 15 I was having nothing to do with it and I wasn't participating so I still have all my brain I'm in great hell because I never participated in the drug thing I didn't need anybody else's approval I wasn't part of a clique I didn't know that peer pressure bother me actually I tried to talk all my friends in high school well my acquaintances I didn't have a lot of friends I had a head or tribe at home I would tell the hologram I said you're nuts for taking the stuff you get a burn your brain cells up you know what are you going to become you can't even think right and people got I think I think 60 out of 600 seniors are od'd in my senior class all from drugs and all of them started on marijuana every single one of them they actually give it to you free they give it to you free get you hooked up then they bring something stronger to you that's how it works I was in the elevator in the hotel and I heard a young man he said coming on business to meet with some business people here and he was saying the phone not who I was we blasted him with the anointing the whole time is and when he love is that oh yeah I had a great time my business meeting were very productive he said these people they were real real with me we drank and we smoked some I knew what he meant okay he didn't need it from the distal purposes but these were leaders in a business community that gave it to this young man that's not even ethical it's not right he hadn't even had it before but that's the enemy's plan and he was a man this was an amazing experience in my mind I'm thinking devil you are not getting that person man I stand right now releasing the anointing him he walked out the door we sent the host event I pulled all of the strongholds of the demonic the addictive demonic to toll that stronghold off of him and pull it off of him and we were sending on the glory after him the anointing after him to break the yoke of Darkness off of him and went god I am not tolerating this I'm not tolerating it and people were Jesus didn't he said he talks about any kind of Pharmacia that was drugs even back in his day they had them he talked about necromancer's have nothing to do with a necromancer that is witchcraft there's no good witches and there's people that really think there are there are no good witches warlocks wizards magicians there was not one magician in the Bible that was good and we sitting here we've been so consumed with society and the world itself that we've accepted a lot of stuff but let me tell you he never accepted it so we need to take a good long look at herself and say where am I where am i and what God has called me to be what he what he showed me I am what Christ gave me how did he walk where did he do we had bracelets for ever what would Jesus do not a lot of what goes on now because if we're witnesses our lives supposed to be a witness right you didn't know you're going to come to church tonight I'm saving the good step for next all those in Abraham's bosom they lived a righteous life according to you receiving God okay they believed who he was they believed when he spoke they believed they followed him and what he said and so they were kind of righteous so they were they descended in Abraham's bosom but the minute Lazar showed up they knew something was going to happen on the earth not just to them then you somebody change for them because their Messiah had come they knew it they knew something would be manifested in the earth and it certainly was maybe not what they expected but let me tell you when Christ Himself showed up a little while later with the sea from the cross because when Christ gave up his spirit he'd still be hanging there by the way he did no one killed him he laid down his life he actually had to make his spirit man leave his body he himself loosed it from his body yeah that's going to be in a movie one day and then you will see in the movie Christ descending into Abraham's bosom him sharing the good news with him all receiving him as Christ as their Savior and let me tell you when his spear man entered into that ground there was such an upheaval that they themselves walked on the earth Deborah and Abraham's bosom go read the scripture they were seen walking on the earth is that crazy you think they'd get a hint right okay uh that one's from 100 years ago 300 years ago he's walking on here something's going on down there [Music] and Christ wasn't done because then he was going to go wreck hell my favorite one of my favorite times is when they took me when they took me down into hell and I was there on the third day when Christ wasted them it will be in a movie [Laughter] [Applause] not even a world-class movie a heaven class maybe they will be produced on this earth by the best of the best with the best special effects that will get people undone everywhere and they'll know what happened there's actually a demand in Hollywood they want to know what happened between the cross and when you when you went back to heaven they want to know they want to know what happened now when he went back when when his disciples saw him ascending into heaven he'd already been there did you know that because when he came out of the grave whither do you tell Mary I must go to my my father and your father right yeah because he had to pour his blood on the mercy seat in heaven so when he said it was finished on the cross that meant that every sacrifice for all sin for all time was once and for all never again when something has to be sacrificed for sin you would never again go to the temple once a year to get forgiven did you know that they went once a year to get forgiven okay then they tried to do the best all year they go back again and then Hilary sigh questions they had this whole thing that God had shown them to do and then there's all kinds of things you need to go back and read it anyway that's the way you got forgiven that's what that's what freaked out all the high priests when John the Baptist started saying you know repent of your sins the kingdom of heaven is at hand well they never heard that before that's why they didn't like him so when new revelation comes to the earth there is always upheaval and you're hearing the new what is the new that means new things will happen new ways will happen new words will happen you're living in a time like that right now yeah because we'll be ruling and reigning with Christ this is a whole new time that was a new time a phonus of time has come that with the fullness of time so crisis we can having on the earth before he ever went into hell then you really wiped up hell because they thought they thought they had won the second time Satan had a brain free honestly he did the father said he lost something in his mind when he fell yeah part of his memory banks because he still thinks even now he's going to win he's already been defeated what he's totally defeated but I mean God kicked him out of heaven he didn't win them when he's going to take over and go inside the Father and rule from his side the Father and be over all the people the people weren't on the earth yet that was us inside God he knew we were in there isn't that interesting he knew about us for a very long time he didn't know who we were he knew we were important he knew we weren't angels because God didn't just speak and make us we lived in him forever until he made this earth time space planet to send us here and when he made Adam his body when the word made out in his body in the father leaned over and breathe Adam his spiritual being his spirit of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul the enemy was right there watching because he was thrown on the oars remember yeah he was watching he knew where that came from he knew that was somebody that came from inside God and then he was not well one way wasn't happy because now God was sending them which would mean a lot of trouble for him if they ever found out who they were so God had a plan when he sent his people if is to be like him on the earth to take authority over all the power of the enemy crush him push him back take our rightful place at Christ one for us he died for your sins but he went into hell to get back your authority the atom had given away because he was righteous and they had no right to hold him so Abraham his bosom was ready to see a show and hell was ready to put on a show there's only one person who put a show on and made a show of it openly and that was the Son of the Living God if you don't think they like a show up there you don't know him because God put on a show was another show when he sent lightning bolts from himself and took Satan out right and then one third of angels were all kicked out the same way they were celebrating in heaven because they had had it up to here with Lucifer I don't know anyone in heaven that cried when he was kicked out the Gabriel did not cry and Michael certainly did not cry because from that moment on he knew who the enemy was because before that happened there was no enemy heaven was a delightful place it was a wonderful place it was perfect in every way even Lucifer was perfect in all his ways until iniquity was found in him and that was that he was greater than God he was going to take over that didn't happen either so he was kicked down to earth and decided well I'm just going to take over here on this nice place I'll just take over here let me tell you what happened when he first made those plans that didn't work either because then God bought the Ice Age and he was sitting on a block of ice you got to picture this all right this is a reality movie from heaven when he was first cast out of heaven the dinosaurs were on the earth there was there was no sin on you there's no darkness on is an evil on the earth okay he brought that with him he began to make it a wilderness the dinosaurs began to kill each other because in the beginning they didn't I saw it I saw those when he made it the first time the dinosaurs walked with the watcher angels they left footprints the angels in the ground and scientists are still trying to figure out how they can make it into cavemen because they have blocks of like stone with a put a human footprint they think and dinosaur prints God put watcher angels on the earth to care for them watch your angels yeah they had flesh on them this is reality movie this is reality movie night and they were here to care for the dinosaurs in God so I'm not tolerating this anymore you know he's going to take over the earth so God broke the water vapor shield that covered the earth what mist on the ground so the dinosaurs skin would fall off there'd been no storms on the earth at one point until of course they heard cracks of lightning and then here comes all the other stuff on the earth it began to make it a wilderness God wasn't going to tolerate it so the water vapor shield he put around the earth which every one of your family members has already seen this in heaven you go into this place called creation lab and God recorded all of it you get to actually see how he made the heavens in the earth they know how all of it happened and that amazing so everybody gets to find that out they know a whole lot up there and so yeah so God broke the water vapor shield at flood of years totally covered the whole earth and then he blew on it and froze and there is Satan with all of his plans wash down the tubes again because now we've got a block of ice and you can do nothing on it and there's the Ice Age somebody didn't enjoy it God removed his glory all cos and I said darkness covered the earth and then we have verse 2 that was all in verse 1 then comes verse 2 and darkness was on the face of the deep right the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters is that correct over the waters he didn't say that was ground over the waters because in the beginning he made it and it was good he created in the beginning of time in space he made this plane to earth and it was finished it was finishing it was good created he created that was past tense right and then we come to verse 2 so something happened between those two verses a whole lot because then he starts to take it apart and put it back together is that what he says yes there was water on everything water on the sky water on the land he took the water off the permanent that was the air that was the sky that was in the ground of the ground I'm doing my emotions again people my staff say don't do that but my hands move ok I'm saying how BAM he began to take it apart it clearly explains to you what he did right so he was going to recreate the earth or he would not have told the animals to replenisher the earth did you get that word read that's like you remodel your home you can't remodel a home that was never there you can't replenish the earth if it wasn't there before so that's what he did everybody in heaven is already seeing everything I'm telling you about he began to take everything apart right so that he could then redo the earth and then he begin to make the animals and all the life back on the earth all the growth was back on the earth again and then he did something different than he hadn't done before he's going to make man in that amazing and then there was the word stepped out of the fall to begin to form Adams body and he looks pretty good I've seen Adam and Eve in heaven yes they have clothes and yes you will have clothing you actually get a wardrobe he can afford more than two garments for you aren't you glad I get asked that question all the time you well your souls exposed on your shoes own the soul is exposed yes ask somebody but the soul your foot is if you need help just take your shoe off and look at it the soles exposed on your on the bottom of your foot you're always touching the ground to heaven they still have boots they have sandals they have all kinds of shoes they are to wear beautiful things amazing things and some of them talk to you your clothing will change colors and your clothes will change on you while you're walking down the street if you cannot decide what you should have worn and you picked out three things as you walk each one will come on you women [Applause] heaven is not normal concerning the service it's heaven where I is not seen nor ear heard and entered in the heart or mind of man regarding favor those that love him except in the last is revealed by the Spirit of God so that means it can be revealed right he's doing that at an accelerated rate and he's shown me a lot on purpose so he wasted hell I'm going to go back to the third day that's okay he wasted how the first day Christ goes along that contact him I'll wait and see if God blesses him and he didn't come and he had taken him into the bay it grabbed him put him in the far reaches up not the outer reaches I've seen there gee don't wanna know about the other witches of hell okay the far reaches of hell they dragged him back what could it gonna do it's a god of she shows up right what are you gonna do you can't hide anything nothing is hidden from God but they thought well we'll just put him back here and hold him the second day came and he didn't show up so Satan thinking well I am and now I'm stronger than him I was smarter than him but it didn't work but he still lost part of his brain because he really thought he's going to win and he was going to put on a show to torture the son of God in front of all of his hierarchy so he sent out a message for all the principalities and powers come in and sit on the front row and he moved up from the back of hell to the front where the gates out there's a courtyard the gates of hell the really gates there and they could see from Abraham's bosom he says put a show on the only ones who could see would be Abraham's bosom right she's going to put a show on showing me he's more powerful than God my church of the son of God he wasn't the one that was gonna torture so here comes the third day right he's got everything set up all the principalities and powers the big guys are all sitting right there in the front row I actually was I saw that I was there I saw all the little demons screaming and yelling all they did was scream and yell and complain complain and yell and blaspheme and complain and yelling buzzing they all the time because they're always everybody none of those demons like each other they were to outdo out lie out cheat whatever they can that's what they do to each other and so they were like they were full of herself because they were on the front row and all the other ones were behind them in a little while though they were going to be glad they weren't on the front road Satan put all his kingly attire on he had made and all of his false gems well he had the gems God still put on him if you didn't know God put gemstones on him for a reason he had a reason he put he made mountings like in a ring and set these amazing beautiful gems they were like thousands of them on him and he was glorious he was glorious so he still had that glory he thought it was his he's going to lose it did you know what the word does it says Christ would he do say it loud yeah that's what he stripped he took every single gemstone off of him that God put on him so here's the shows about to begin Satan's been upon show he was talking all of his hierarchy right and here's Jesus not saying a word just like his father he wasn't saying a word and then all of a sudden there was a roll of thunder and all of his attention was gotten because they remembered what happens after that roll of thunder comes lightning is going to show up somewhere and then Jesus Christ stands up and there is a shout from heaven and Jesus Christ starts releasing the fire of God from himself and melted the faces of all the hierarchy of Hell he began to fade began to burn in the midst of Hell fire with the fire of God literally like blue fire was shooting on his hand and I saw them melt like West's because as a little girl I would see them in different places I saw these demons and their faces were melted like that and like wax and I used to think what is that what did that what did that was about to find out and I mean literally saw them melted it says he ruined and spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of it openly and that's what he did he literally rule they can't go back they've never been able to fix their self okay Satan can't fix you if you're in the army of darkness and you get wounded he can't heal you they got parts missing you can't you can't make them cease to exist but they get wounded they don't get healed okay I've seen them the Holy Spirit calls them shabby debris and if you knew Holy Spirit liked it that's exactly what he would say because I see the host going across the sky all the time I'm a seer I see them I see the demonic armies after they've been in a battle with the hosts of heaven they're hanging on for dear life because nobody wants to help each other like hanging on they have these horrific looks on their face because they've just been wiped out by the hosts of heaven and I said man they look really bad in the Holy Spirit said I call that shabby debris and I go I can't think of a better thing to call it because they look like debris you know something washes up on the shore where parts of it are missing that was down [Music] we better be glad they don't work together well right we're glad they don't even like each other right because the hosts look out for each other they protect each other look out for each other they're there for each other hell is just the opposite nobody cares about anybody so here comes shabby debris they look like shabby debris that day in hell and this is what Jesus was saying you will never have the power to hold a righteous man in this place and anyone who received Christ they will never be able to take you there or hold you there amen and when he was done wasting the principalities and powers then he turns to their leader they ran they didn't wait around to see what was going to happen to him they abandon him they left him they were running over top of a little demons trying to get out of the space they were happy they weren't on the front row that day it worked on their behalf and all of Abraham's bosom were shouting and cheering and yelling and celebrating because they'd already given themself to him had their is their Messiah wiping out the devil he literally he literally ripped his clothes off threw him on the dirt and one by one took every single gemstone away from him and he was left with none it was ugly because all he had was he spiky little settings that God had put all over in his wings and his beings he was decorated by God and now he has put false ones in there he's made false ones they don't look anything like what he did but he was he was utterly totally completely defeated he is a doormat he is not over you he is under you he is under our feet so what is under your feet on your feet is a doormat is that what he says then don't be afraid of him we're not supposed to have any fear in us right and the fear of the Lord is not that you will be afraid that he will hurt you it is you're afraid you will hurt him you so in love with him you don't want to do anything that would hurt the Lord that's what the fear of the Lord is the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and with all your getting of wisdom get understanding which is knowledge of the holy one don't you don't you love the word I love it in that good so there you go that was a reality show from heaven and then he did the the most the greatest insult he did the Satan which to take something that not just his he took her you know he had no pride life really early stripped him of all his glory and he fell because of that glory but he did something even worse than that he took away authority he took away authority that he had gained because Adam gave it to him and he had been ruling with that authority until something changed that's one of the reasons like Christ had to come he had to come he had to walk as a man like you and i choosing not to friend say not to sin he had to choose that with his own will not to sin because him being not just righteous but holy okay and then him being going into hell may think that they could keep him it was devastating to the enemy when he realized we should have never taken him cuz i said if they had known they would have never done it right it was bushwhacked time the enemy was bushwhacked by the Son of God and so he expands our F he stripped almost all the gemstones off of them he reaches down and takes away the keys keys represent authority they have always represented Authority and you know that if the wealthiest man in a city back in Christ time and even before that the wealthiest people were given the keys to the city did you know that that's not just something we do here on earth you know when you see someone comes to Halloween order they come to a state they does something great like Oral Roberts was actually given the key to Oklahoma City by the mayor the mayor the governor one of them and they actually redeemed their self because they weren't on on God's high list because of the way they had treated Oral Roberts they scorned him they made fun of him they judged him criticized him in the media and the newspapers but before he died somebody got smart and they apologized to him in public they gave him the key to the city not just the city after the game to see the key to that city but also I think the governor in the mayor were both there apologized repented on behalf of all those who had mistreated him recognized him for the contribution that he had done for them and so they gave him the key to the city that's still significant today when you have a key but the wealthy people were always sat in the city gate back in Jesus times and before that in Abraham's day the wealthy people sat in the city gate with the elders and they were recognized because they gave contributions to help the city and said they were given keys and they were given money bags and they had Authority they had to say over what went on in that city they were recognized by the wisdom because of the wealth and so that's just something that's always been well he lost all of it and held that day he lost all of his authority all of his glory all of his a lot of respect from the demonic because they realized then at that very moment our lives aren't going to be the same because now we can be wasted by anyone who is righteous can waste us everyone who receives him will now have power over us so their lives were changing even say his life was changing he had to get a lot better at deception because he no longer had those keys to hell death and the grave and I probably won't have time to go into tonight but Christ uses those keys he uses them for us you should be really happy about that amen we have so many promises given to no one no one else in the earth except those who receive Jesus Christ you have great power on the inside of you have great authority you have already been given Dominion on the earth don't don't act like you're nothing don't say you're nothing you have great value everybody person every one here is valued by God everyone here was given a gift to use in the natural realm in heaven you're going to use that gift whether it's baking cookies making a really amazing barbecue designing apparel designing interior design designing amusement parks making movies in heaven sports in heaven our plate is worship yellow really quiet how many people have never heard me talk about this before I know someone who has let me see your hands okay it makes sense because God gave you that gift they are irrevocable as a matter of fact even the wicked have their gifts and they won't be taken away from them you choose how to use that gift in the earth that's why there's people who belong to Satan and they have gifts to act or sing or whatever it is and what they produce is dark because their heart is dark they're going to have the gifts no matter what amen but your gift is so important that that God calls it precious is something special he called you you are a gift every good and perfect gift that's you comes down from the Father of lights that was you you were like you were made of light he knit you together in your mother's womb at the time of conception the spiritual body made our light was knit together with that physical little dot of flesh and that's when life begins but when you came you had you were that gift already whether it was someone who was going to sing or be a musician dance create a clothing apparel food spices roads highways anything you see in this place was created by somebody it was designed and invented by somebody you wouldn't have anything to wear to walk on to sleep on to sit on to look at entertainment places to go and enjoy yourself you wouldn't have highways to drive on planes to go in those were gifts God people to be and all those gifts are used in heaven for everybody who lives there so it's not boring yes they have stylists there they have salons there they color your hair with light this is heaven culture everyone in heaven has color in their hair so we're at it's like art it's considered a form of art okay they also have the culinary arts in heaven everybody eats food and they love it it tastes better than anything you've had on the earth and don't argue with me because the mirror supper of the lamb is not grapes and crackers if the Lord of glory was going to have a supper he made everything never insisted he's not going to give you just grapes they'll be unending food everywhere everything you've loved to eat with no weight gain or food allergies and I happen to know that that wedding supper is going to last a long long time he has a really big house this is just reality time I guess we're having a reality heaven show of things that happened throughout time okay even Elijah loves to tell the story of the profits of ale because he saw what happened in the spirit realm when all that went on so when you go to heaven now and he shares that has a whole different meaning like when you get to heaven and you get to see how Christ wasted hell you will shout and scream forever there was a day Satan was kicked out there was a day he was crushed down he had authority stripped from him he was unseated from his authority that he operated in the earth for generations and ages because something new was happening the Messiah was on the earth and then he went and died for us so that every everything you ever commit when you repent and say when I repair it will be forgiven he will cleanse me from all unrighteousness like it never happened heaven absolutely celebrates every time somebody gives yourself to Christ especially all the family members who never get to never missed that every family member saw all of your family get born again they saw the babies being born they saw the weddings every birthday on your birthday they go in heaven get a gift and put it in your mansion this being built so when you come there every year you were apart they have a gift for you you got a lot of family you'll have a much the ceiling probably going out the doors your pets to be there taking over your mansion if you had a whole lot you probably have heavens ooh because she has a sense of humor beyond not just creativity's be able to imagine his humor is beyond anything you imagined and you will not stop laughing okay you will laugh - you fall on the streets of gold and people step over you everybody wants to know you the disciples will come to greet you the prophets we have prophets watching us right now from heaven there watching this meeting right now will I talk about them okay we have the ancient prophets we have the new ones who just passed home to heaven and are enjoying their rewards and their celebration in the throne room I know I've already seen Kim coming up there I've seen all Roberts Billy Joe Daughtry I've seen many people great men and women of God I've seen them in heaven I've seen celebrities in heaven that made it up there as John Wayne lives in cowboy heaven did you think they wouldn't have on what was his gift cowboy movies and they don't even have the ratings on them aren't you glad all family-friendly every single one of them Wow when I used to speak in Hollywood I say if you want to use that gift you there you better go to heaven you won't use it down there no I do not have breakfast in hell they don't have movies in Hell either okay you don't get popcorn you get nothing and heaven you have this little menu that appears and you pick what you want and there's your food right there where you watch the movie the movie that is being captured probably not far from where you're at showing instantaneously Indy Cedars in heaven they're called reality theaters it was a very first place they took me they could have taken me anywhere 1996 I was caught up to have him for the first time Jesus warns me walked through the wall in my home I was doing dishes although I spent a lot of time in prayer it wasn't during that time he walked in while I was washing dishes not my favorite thing to do I tell people I'm not Susie homemaker okay I am a business person but of course I raised three daughters I was a wife I had to take care of my home while I was doing everything else at the same time and so Jesus walked through the wall on my home he said go sit down the father and I are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and I didn't say no and the first place it took me was still a fun place because I knew there was a throne room I knew there were certain places already in heaven I knew they were there I knew about the River of Life it talks about it in the Word of God it says heaven is a country and it's a city so I knew they had both even if I hadn't seen him I knew they were both there go read Hebrews eight correct it's in Hebrew a writer says heaven is a city it's the country yeah so go read and Hebrews actually talks a lot about heaven that's what the great cloud of witnesses has talked about the great people of faith have passed onto so go read Hebrews it talks about heaven so I knew there were certain things there cut and I was delighted I thought there was probably something fun to do I didn't realize that heaven is almost 50/50 have fun and have profound because when his children came on me I have something for them to enjoy and do and so yeah I was the first place I was taken Jesus came into person yes I knew it was him I'd actually seen him quite a few times on the earth before he walked through the wall of my home I've known him since I was four years old I got saved twice h4 and h5 and this was 1996 when this happened so I had had and encounters with angels I could see I was always a seed see the demonic operations I see Heaven's operations all around me my grandmother had some of that and her my dad had encountered angels it was a way of life it wasn't like strange something strange to me but it was absolutely delightful to see that there's so many fun things to do in heaven and what's in my books our encounters I had and how people got stunned when God would take me up let me stand by the family members who had just passed away I heard them talking about their life on earth I knew the family members names I knew what they look like even though I had never met them on the earth then God would walk me through the mansions I would see how the mansion was built I knew what was on their property and then he would bring me back down and then he would give me their family members names and phone numbers on the earth if he can take you to heaven and show you stuff if he knows every hair on your head he knows all your phone numbers right and I would write it down he'd have me call it he had me type everything down I heard and saw and then I would call these people and say I didn't have pink hair back then managed to do that okay he still shows me people but but when I started this whole thing I didn't have being care and I say I believe God has shown me something about your family member and have them would you like to know what it is and I didn't know these people I didn't know they didn't know how I got their number I didn't want to tell me I got the number I just said God has shown me something and they will go who are you talking about and I say their family members name he would get David I couldn't see buddy they were shaking on the other end of the line they go yes I want to know will you meet me at the mall will you meet me at the park because they sure weren't going to invite me to their home they never want to take me to their home they never ever ever took me to their home and I would show up and I would have everything typed down on a piece of paper God even gave it a title did you know God loves name things he gave it a title like it was a script and I wrote it like it was a script I put to everything in clothes that Jesus said that I heard them say you know I described the aromas the emotions the colors everything the frequencies that were there how they traveled what was in their mansion what it looked like what their favorite colors were what their gift was because they were using their gift and I didn't know anything of them and I tell them to sit down and I would hold the paper up here so I didn't look at him and I just began to read and I would hear then laugh and cry and cry and laugh and laugh and cry and they would shake and when I was done I'd say do you believe God showed me just about your family member and happen and it wasn't for me it was for them and they go I don't know you I never met you but you told me things only my family member would know so I have to believe you saw my family member they were so absolutely undone and then they began to tell me they confirmed what I saw because I knew what they were doing in a new third it was because you use that gift in heaven whether they were a florist in heaven or they're designing apparel in heaven whether they were over the use in heaven which the thirteen-year-old girl was put over the youth of heaven and she was 13 and her whole life she planned to be a youth pastor and she mentored kids in her elementary school in her middle school everybody loved her I heard from her mother after I shared all the stuff I saw her with a great grandfather that looked like he was in 20s and he was taking her on rollercoaster rides in the amusement park and I mean huge roller coasters like the biggest ones called the rush at leasts off the track goes across the sky to another part of the track yeah I thought it was pretty cool and the wild thing was the Angels were riding them too they were riding them too I could not see the end of this amusement park up in there three times I could not see the end to it kids got in bubbles and rode over in bubbles or you went by you and learn how to fly like Superman then you flew over it guess who teaches you how to fly [Music] Christopher Reeve I hear your thoughts he got born again he got born again what did you do on earth it was Superman right he teaches you to fly in heaven so I'm telling you this is all this is in my first trip to have it and I remember every aroma every emotion I remember every word that people said I remember every creature that I saw what they look like the flowers saying they change colors the hosts of heaven were there there was beautiful angels that were green like dust like green emerald us except Dells or waterfalls and they care for the waterfalls and the streams in heaven and they were feminine-looking they were so captivating this song was so captivating so I remember all that and my first trip in Christ remember Christ took me aside before he brought me back and he goes I want you to tell them on the earth there'll be many people in heaven they never expected to see there but they prayed them in if they don't give up on them we will not give up on them if you belong to me I won't let your words drop to the ground and I got undone I think it was the most spectacular thing that happened when I was there was when he told me that because he said it will give hope to so many people because he's a good god isn't he and so I saw this young girl was talking to a great grandfather as they're walking down this path going to when you're going into a new part of heaven there's gates that are always open there's just like columns of gates as not walls inside heaven and that's they were going through these big purple and gold gates and they were going to the amusement park I didn't know that at the time and so the Lord said get up there so you can hear what that young girl's saying and she was talking about her mom that they had a great relationship my mom again I'm going to kiss her in both cheeks I'm going to share everything has happened to me up here in heaven I wish she knew I was a youth leader in heaven and then she just kept talking then I saw them going to a rollercoaster rides and then Christ brought me back and I got her mom's number in Colliver and the funeral had just happened and she was at that time her only daughter and although I was told later that she was profited over by a prophetess that she would have a very short life but she wouldn't act the whole world for Christ which she was because of the testimony and so when I was sharing this with her mom outside JC Penney's at a table at the mall she got undone and she began to tell me after I told her all the stuff I saw I saw on the roller coasters I heard the words that she said and she was crying and weeping and she said that what I told you I've never known you never met you I don't know you but you said things only my daughter knew she goes the day before she died the day before they buried her I was in her room and I saw a journal under her bed that was written she was like 7 her daughter was 13 when she passed away she said I start to go through it look at the pages and I found written on the pages these words last night I dreamed I died early and went to heaven early I saw my great-grandfather and I went on rollercoaster rides I didn't know that journal is a derp it was wonderful but he only gave me a peek so as fast as a rollercoaster I fell back to earth and her mother was the only one who knew about that journal and I didn't know her mother you know what God was doing he was givin me evidence that heaven was not only real but it was fun she said her daughter every day would kiss on both cheeks before she went to school when she came home she shared everything that had happened to her life in her life during that day and she had planned her whole life to be a leader a youth pastor and a leader that was her goal and she was doing that in heaven at age 13 I heard her say you know that I'm cheering my mom on you know she didn't know she couldn't see me okay people never saw me in heaven but I heard all these words and she said that she was a cheerleader and her favorite colors were blue and white she was learning a blue light tunic top and pant when I saw her it was her favorite color even on notice so you still have your favorite colors in heaven and so all these things everything I said that I wrote down that I remembered was significant to her she'd never been the same since then she said she was my only daughter they tell me I can't have children God said tell her that she will have children I'll give her children and she has two twins right now ten year old twins with strawberry blonde hair like Marissa head blue eyes and star brave on here twins and they have encounters in heaven so we have a good God that cares about you that cares about me you won't miss your destiny when you go to heaven none of your children will mr. destiny whatever he chose them to be here and that gift he gave them it was a dancer to be a dancer in heaven if it was a cookie Baker to be a cookie Baker in heaven if it was a fisherman there'll be a fisherman in heaven if it was to create and invent all kinds of neat a high-tech gadgets actually have a place called techno city in heaven where all the geeks live and they can create all kinds of just the wildest craziest things you even beyond what we have here on the earth although I saw some of those being brought to the earth because they have ideas owned in heaven and you see all these little sparkles in it like a million little pieces of glitter and every one of them is an idea and invention and God sends he takes a wave of that and sends it over the earth and it drops all these ideas and inventions in our minds and whoever grabs that idea and creates that idea that's why I see things on the earth already that I've seen in heaven because they come from him does it say that they come from him yeah that's how we send them and then amazing so God has a lot of plans for us right here on this earth right now everybody in here is special because you're alive right now everyone in heaven is cheering you on to run your to run your race right now in this kingdom age to live heaven culture to demonstrate and manifest for God it's not about how much education you've had it's not about what race you're born in it has nothing to do with any of that it has to do that you belong to Jesus Christ that you have given your life to him you've received him he put you here for a purpose he gave you authority power weapons he's now going to add to that creativity and invention say I receive it and he's also right now in this time and people are always asking me you know when you're going to start creating things and put it in the marketplace because I will create heaven on earth not just reveal heaven on earth my first assignment was reveal it my second one is to create it we're going to create many products and things they haven't haven't apparel games things for children we're going to produce movies in the earth places to go for entertainment for everybody to enjoy architecture and interior design we're going to create walls that will talk to you and it will have movement in them you won't just paint your walls anymore you don't paying them you want wallpaper you're going to get parts of heaven and put them on there your new technology is coming where you'll learn how to paint masterpieces with a light wand I saw people with drive-through tattoo parlors and they put it on with light like what marking belongs to God it was stolen by the enemy and he put his marks on people for generations there's a scripture in Psalms that says some people worship me in in song some and dance and some will put my marks on them Joyce Myers read that now she's getting a tattoo if Joyce Myers can do I don't know who can say I'm not going to do it I don't know anybody here's this conservative hosting reel as Joyce I love Joyce everybody say thank God for Joyce she keeps us real doesn't she I can't wait to see what she's going to pick we're living in a new time like I was explaining John the Baptist brought a new time with him there were new ways to do things okay that had nothing to do with the past and a lot of people rejected it because they knew God had said to do it this way well in that time he did things a certain way he himself doesn't never change but he is a great creator and he does bring new things to the earth all the time and people go well if I can't see it line by line written well it doesn't say he's going to have microwaves do you have one it doesn't say you'll have cellphones but do you own one okay it doesn't even talk about cars but do you have one yes because as time goes by new things are brought to the earth and invented that we use to improve our life is that correct that so that doesn't mean there's going to be that you won't see new things you've never seen before and these are things I'm talking about that will help all of humanity to either in to either make your life easier or to make you have a happier life a healthier life a more informed life there are new things coming to this earth I saw roads that we traveled on that were made out of light and the fuel was the light I glad something's excited I was shown these new things we will have hologram computers we can reach in and take the things out of the light and look at them then put them back in there I saw several major diseases including cancer that did not even exist on the earth it will be abolished just think how much that will change your life new fuels one is coming from outer space are [Music] y'all excited say Amen because you're staring at me do you know how much that will change our life we won't need the fuel from the desert or the sheiks we won't even need the coal from underground ok we won't even need solar energy I'm not talking about solar energy a whole fuel that God already put up there and all they need is the night the right receiver to bring it down in the transmitters in everybody's home to fuel your entire home and I saw what they look like they're about this big and you can move it wherever you want to you got in the middle of desert and camp and have have energy your bug zappers won't be flyswatters anymore because I take one when I go and I want one that big because I don't like bugs when I 16 at a youth camp and I was finally invited to a banquet by someone who was brave my mama bought me this pretty dress had white lace sleeves here my neck was up to here and I went and took that thing I was hanging in the cabin I went on walk out to go meet my date for the banquet and something was moving up my sleeve how are you told you I don't like it want no little bug it was just big and it was crawling up my arm this way and I was really shy so I was going to tell anybody it was one of those grasshoppers black and red ones you know those things look like they came either from hell or from some other planet those like they could take over the world and wanted to they had an attitude if you ever looked him in the eye I wouldn't I wouldn't suggest you do that when I'm here like this right trying to calmly talk first time in my life I went anywhere with the opposite text at all I got this pretty dress on and in the sleeves you know I was I was real skinny I mean real skinny and so that's the only reason why that thing was able to get up there and I've got lace you know lace does not move okay you can't open it up and shake something out so this thing is crawling further and further and I'm like I'm trying to hang on to it right and I'm like I thought it was going to faint in front of the house that's not going to be a good first impression I want to excuse me and I was a really fast runner I chased my brothers all the time for my momma I ran so fast at that cabin locked the door and I threw everything off I was going to take everything and there was that big ugly thing this big I didn't kill it I didn't want to go anywhere near I'm like oh my what I'm gonna do I had to wait for it to walk away from my clothes so I could put him back I to go back out there you know about 15 minutes later and he goes are you okay I am I'm really good I'm all good right now and I sent my friends in the cabin to for the demise of the grasshopper so when I go camping I take big things to deal with the bugs but when you get this energy from space okay you can get the biggest bug zapper and probably put it around your entire can't so anything that comes up there is going to get zapped before it ever gets hot it was the most amazing thing it was just like a they had this thing that you pulled it down from space and everybody had them they just had them in their homes I saw them line highways and a hologram light they don't have lamppost like solid like this they have little things like this and all they did was have to place them where they went and attach them to the ground they have one little station a little kind of a thing like that and when they hit it the light shot up from the ground and let the entire highway all the way down you didn't have to dig in the ground plant wiring run all the way down somewhere and hook it up to something this was a new form of energy that will change our world the missionaries wherever they are they can have power all the time no matter where you are out in the ocean on a boat it doesn't matter where you are because it's going to draw it down from space and he took me quite a while showing me this took me into the future and show me what this is going to be a great day for everybody and he said in your light in your lifetime which is probably before ever it is going to happen ha ha ha ha I'm not planning to die I don't know about you I'm staying till he's done with me I'll let him choose that man I'm not planning to escape on my rapture rod because even we can't decide that right so I'm just trying I'm just trying to share a little bit about what is coming into your lives it will affect you your kids your grandchildren great-grandchildren great-great-great great-great-great grandchildren there have been quite a few people that have been caught up and taken over a hundred years into the future I've been taking almost 150 years into the future and the perilous times had not happened but it got better and greater and more powerful because the body of Christ was standing up and being who God called them to be they're no longer tolerated darkness or evil they weren't participating with it by by complaining and saying what they didn't have and who they weren't they stopped saying words of negativity you can't live a positive prosperous life if your soul is continually being fed negative words you just can't do it and actually if all you do is take in the doom and gloom you're not even going to be happy do you know God told me in order to create invent you had to be happy you had to be happy you know actually isn't happy better than sad do you know there's more things released in your body that are good when you are happy when you're sad and oppression comes things stop changing even inside the way that your body is forming I don't know all those details about that okay I don't know those details don't care about them I just know that your inward workings of your body begin to not be good and if you live around negativity all the time then that's not good for you but you can change the atmosphere even where you live go in your room and say I'm not participating with all these words I'm evicting all these words out of the atmosphere of where I live I don't have to tolerate them I'm reaching the life of God the power of God the presence of God right here this is the atmosphere I'm going to breathe it doesn't matter who owns that place if you were there you have the right to change the atmosphere you live in you can imagine if the body of Christ ever gets this about the new time it starts operating like that how much change are we going to bring we were sent here to help change things is that right Christ came and changed many things just a few short years he was here he rocked this world it's our time to put on a show this is all about the show begins you saw it you heard about the show in heaven and let me tell you when all that was going on of the deception of the Angels it wasn't just like calmly quietly done that's not the way it was done it was great deception and Lucifer never told them I'm going to take over me evil and killed still in the story he didn't say that to any of those angels he said I'm going to be greater than God I care more I'm wiser he doesn't know what I'm doing he doesn't know what I'm saying so I'm going to make sure everybody has wealth everybody has power we can all celebrate together while I rule and then he would have his own concerts it said he'd trafficked his wares he showed off that he could create because he was highly anointed for that and he would do then you draw angels to himself let me tell you a third of them followed him but two thirds didn't follow him and angels are real beings like you and I they're not married okay God had some mercy on him I'll be married 40 years to the same human being this November and I'm not picking anyone else okay been through it once didn't you survive Victoria actually is still very much in love with my husband and everybody knows it's a journey isn't it you learn to love and die and love and die and love and die and loving to hide it to someone dies more than the other there's a lot more love and then you keep loving you having gray so they can finish dying to themselves and then it's wonderful but you won't be married in heaven you'll be best friends you remember you were married you'll do things all over heaven together and you will show off who's your husband who's your wife on the earth you celebrate all over heaven you go look it isn't she gorgeous the most beautiful thing you've seen this is who I was married to on earth yeah and they won't talk about any of the hard times they won't talk about any of the crazy times okay oh you share them if you had cats you share them because you live right next door and you're your bot oh you were better parents they'll probably visit you more often you share them it's like children like when when um when parents come home to having a few if you had a miscarried little baby and you get that little baby you share them they say with mothers they're the father but this is that most of those people go everywhere together in heaven and and there's no like there's not like sleepovers okay although people move in and stay with you for why I'm just preparing you I'm giving you a heads-up warning right now when you come home to have it all of your family will move into your mansion they probably already got their space picked out because they have missed you and they want to be with you okay this is a good news if you're going on a tour tell them to enjoy themselves to get back only they're probably going to follow you on the tour everybody goes on tours of heaven it doesn't matter if you stay with each other it doesn't matter okay I saw oh I call them community mansions it was like a big hub like a big huge massive common area like probably like half a Denver and all for this this comes a common area which was so supernatural as things you all enjoy doing together on the earth it was uh even if it could include outdoor stuff by the way you can't say was all like under a building no I'm talking about it was everything you enjoy doing on yours together as a family and then off of this are all these massive mansions coming off almost like a wheel with spokes and every spoke would be like I don't know I saw mansions the size of a city so I can't ever even say how big these mansions were and so everybody had their own space because you come home as his son and his daughter okay that's how you come home because he is your father when you come home you recognize your son and your daughter and he gives everybody their own space and you will be very glad you have it you will love whatever it gives you if you're so super now too you could never afford to pay for buy or even build it here and it's going to be built around your gift the thing that is your action that you love the most and then you go on tours all over heaven and Christ invites you to his own private mansion where he's always a big party for you and invites all the disciples the Apostles the prophets to come and see you and they're coming there to meet you he sends a special chariot or cherrish to come and pick you up and then he has you decked out like a king or a queen and then you come and he escort you into his place and introduces you and everybody celebrates that you're there and then you eat like forever he has a massive ballroom is the biggest part of his mansion because he loves to dance and on although all down the walls are like Kings tables laden with every kind of dessert you can imagine and his mansion sits in this field of flowers that are like six foot tall all of them sing the most glorious songs they are worshiping the Lord of glory they will all know your name they were all welcomed you as you come down this magnificent drive to say everybody say Jesus deserves his own place just like us and he has won but he made a way so that you won't ever be away from him yeah like this reality show tonight some people are hearing it for the first time if we're live streaming or realized streaming some some of these people for the first time in their life are probably getting rocked you know their mind is probably so going bonkers the first time I talked to him about something because that's what heaven does to you when you get there you walk around like you don't even know what to say you're looking at everything you're undone by the ground by the grass by the sky by the beings by the sounds the images of frequencies people riding on the worship you know I mean beams of light shooting by and it's a person coming from somewhere in heaven you step into his transport kiosks that are light beams shooting out and you ride on the light to places Rania and you're walking down these streets of gold if you can't you can look in them you can it can actually see your image in the streets ago it looks like I don't know it's transparent gold but it's beautiful you can't even tell the depth of it you can't there's gems everywhere massive gems everywhere the mulch and the flowerbeds are gems like real gems and the angels will come to numbers and grab them up and throw them down to the earth and that's how they get in the meetings so your Europe your being undone by everything that you're walking by everything that you're seeing in heaven and you'll never stop feeling that way you will never stop being undone that matter of people have been there five hundred years a thousand years two thousand years they're still surprised by God he's always creating new things putting new things through they're discovering new things it's so huge a massive you know I mean one day I don't even know if I'll get to see Ellis before he makes a new earth and that amazing I I love him I love him more every day if you go off can you carry that because he lets me he lets me carry it I have a I have a can you remember in the natural I have words anymore I have a photographic memory he gave me that from the time I was a little kid it helped a lot in school I look at a list one time you never have to look at again I remembered everything it said I'd read one thing like you know two weeks later we had a test and I would pass every test because I remember but he wanted somebody with a with a photographic memory to do this so they can remember everything I remember the thousands of times I've been there I remember everything I remember every detail I remember the aromas will get you undone Christ Himself carries an aroma and I can go places and I know he was there it's beautiful it's a beautiful smell but also smelled the other side I know when they've been in places and it's putrid it smells like death so yes they both exist heaven exists hell exist just like the Bible says okay you have to read the word to know it if you don't know the words then it can't bring it alive to you if you don't read the words you can't bring if you can't highlight stuff I know how many people ever happen you read a scripture so many times in one day you read it and it comes alive to you if you read the word you are storing it in your soul and in a moment when you need it that's how come it comes up in you because you put it there yourself when you read it I play the Bible somewhere in my house and it's always feeding my soul you can feed your soul at night while you're sleeping and I don't know why more believers don't but I play powerful anointed worship 24 hours a day in my home because he inhabits the praises of his people whether it's in person or whether it's on a CD okay there's anointed sound songs frequencies if you play and put them in your home it will draw heaven to your home you know that's what we should all put there right so y'all stand up for a minute I want to thank you for letting me share I don't want to keep it really long because I know I have to be back in the morning I was supposed to share about some of my products I there's one called revealing of the Kings it's the spiritual Kings in case you didn't know this revelation this is the day he's revealing the spiritual Kings who will walk in the earth that whoever runs after that those are eternal levels of authority Christ said you will rule and reign with me now right in the ages to come he will rule with him throughout eternity that's not a temporary position there's lords priests and kings and he told me face-to-face what I have written on my thigh is not natural kings I am the king of spiritual kings who will walk in high levels of authority in the earth no man can give them that title they will demonstrate they operate in that authority and Dominion in the earth and that's how people will know who they are so there are priests it says in the word we are priests and kings to our God and he's the king of King and Lord of lords that's what this thing tells you about now Scrolls of times of open the culture of Honor how they live in heaven the kingdom age born-again that I already told you about powerful and this one which is hilarious not theirs is because superheroes narium with the superhero costume on that was not my plan kids love it so they're Emma superhero you all know that if you pray for others as you stand in the gap for others then you are superheroes for heaven I went to Morningstar to speak for the women and they invited me to speak to the five-year-olds I did not know now I warned I have a superhero costume it's not spandex tights okay but it's but a superhero blue pants I mean stretch a superhero blue so I would get it right and and I have my superhero shirt on and all my little things I wear and I did not know that the Bible teacher had just taught them for six weeks that they were superheroes for heaven and I didn't know that they had all drawn pictures of me wearing a superhero costume because that wasn't even on the agenda that wasn't on the program for me to even speak to them but when I went to go speak to them God said you're taking that with you and I I am like like am i wearing that on the platform for like all the adults and he said no but take it and then when they said you want to speak to fire Jeff I will speak to them because I knew it was going to wear so here I come in the back of the room and all the little kids are up there giving testimonies in the bible teacher stand and he starts laughing out loud Here I am my superhero costume and all the kids start screaming and yelling so I kind of ran and I jumped into their safety it was a very memorable meeting and then they called me up front they each gave me the little picture of the hit troupe of me isn't Holy Spirit awesome he set that whole thing up because I had no idea I just said yes when he said take it and I'm like okay oh they're good and all the little kids uh we took pictures together and I hugged him I encouraged him I told them how how pleased the father was what a great future they had on this earth and so it was something I won't forget it was awesome amazing so buddy hold up their hands I'm going to I'm going to just speak something into your line I'm a prophesy corporately he won't let me do it individually but you know what this is the time for the corporate body of Christ and when I say this is for everybody watching also hold up your hands okay I speak for the Most High God and I say you will be great in the earth I say you will do greater works even in Christ did I say you live in a supernatural time were you your self will create witty ideas and inventions and bring them to mankind to change them forever I say you will walk in truth you will walk in the spirit you will move in the spirit you will travel in the spirit you will shake things you will stun hell you will carry the light of God and here you shine like the stars in the heavens you will handle the world of the wicked you will push back darkness you will run your race with the hosts of heaven I declare decree that you are priests that your Lords there were kings unto your God receive it says your God amen hey none a man and you will live long enjoy happiness and have the most fun you've ever had in your life may you prosper being helped and may the hosts go with you amen oh that is awesome you know what's amazing it seemed

know why I'm saying that some may not when the army of heaven goes to battle against the darkness that is their war cry why because they're excited you're gonna crush the enemy's plans over you right they're gonna crush them they're gonna pull down strongholds that have been rising against you that's why they were created news flash from heaven they weren't created to protect heaven they were made by the creator of heaven they didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third of the angels out then you get to do that Michael hell them and the Father sent a lightning bolt a million megawatts of love from himself and took him out and then one third of angels went out the same way so they've been waiting a long time to war on our behalf full time amen I may or may not give you scripture for that tonight go look it up I think most of us know that Jesus was the lord of state loud the host is the name of the army of heaven yes they're still part of the angel tribes but they're different in many ways the ones under Gabriel have many different positions and jobs in heaven and on the earth and they look more like us they're the ones who look more like us the army of heaven mostly does not look anything like us they're creatures most of them are creatures they're fierce looking they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps so what the Holy Spirit says they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps however there was one time when they had to take the place of the worship angels which were the one-third that were kicked out the only ones Lucifer got were the ones he was over he was over one-third of the angels was the worship angels obviously if he was the one who led them in worship all the time in heaven I'm just gonna give you full out Revelation because I want to take advantage of all the time I have so if you didn't know this he used to step inside God to lead worship he covered over the very heart of God with his wings which were embellished with gems he had gems on his back on his front people go well he had just a few no he had really hundreds of them on him and when God made him he made mountings like in a ring and every gem was mounted and amounting like a ring that you would wear like this one here and he was beautiful which is one of the reasons why he ended up by falling from pride from his beauty also he thought he was smarter than God and that was a that was busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz you're gonna laugh a lot tonight alright heaven laughs every time the devil loses down here all of heaven roars yes they know what's going on and today they were attendants for Paul Cain with Paul Cain not talking about the body talk about his spirit man everyone gets to see their own homecoming isn't that nice so we're colors and play lots of music and dance because that's what they'll be doing in heaven news flash from heaven number two they don't have a funeral in heaven when you come home say Amen you shouldn't expect one we should have a party zone down here when we send people off instead of a funeral home someone opened a party zone I promise you'll make more money than other people with funeral homes cuz even the world will want to send theirs off wherever they think they're going they'll pick a party anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea I've been giving up for years I don't think anybody's done it yet so there you go the more real heaven becomes to the body of people will want to send them off with a real celebration because of the reality of what heaven is and what they're going to be experiencing there it won't make sense to have a sad funeral while they're watching from the party I'm a seer that means I see in the unseen realm okay mister I'm really happy Danny because I got to experience all that heaven was doing and what was going on with Paul Kane and his mother and his sisters you know his family that's up there and the others who were attending up there watching his service he enjoyed every funny thing that was told he likes to be real so he liked all the reality of who he was he liked that personal side of him being talked about so next time you plan a family members homegoing service tell some jokes because they will laugh I was at a service one time and back home and it was um trying to member the guys name I remember told McClellan he was part of story side B and he died suddenly and I came into his service I didn't know anyone but I was coming to bring some books about heaven to his family the Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him watching from the portal that was really difficult you know to try to pretend to be sad and I never wear black it's okay if you if you go to somewhere where they're expecting you know to do what is proper not to upset them but no one's wearing black in heaven they're not and they aren't having to partying there was I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what I don't know you know helps my human head lots of times because they kind of took that away from me I used to be kind of brilliant really then they made me like eight years old life is much easier being that way you know what you don't worry about things you don't think about what's gonna happen five years down the road when you don't even know or you already planned you know prepare for disasters or something I never got that really if we're over the weather then we shouldn't be concerned about the weather we rule over it amen okay she didn't know news bulletins number three writes number three are you keeping track you're gonna get a gift number three Jesus was over the weather we are joint ears we get to be over the weather and that great you're gonna see that more and more I'm serious you're gonna see it more and more things stop like stop can't wait for that to happen meteorologists might have to get another job not making fake news by the way they don't work now and it's not gonna work when it's not actually happening what was I talking about number three boys over over the weather Jesus was over the weather and he tried so hard to teach his disciples he really was in case you didn't know they were in boot camp with him for three years it wasn't just watch what I do it's learn what I do and then do it right he was gonna go he's gonna go back for some R&R and he had to make sure they understood how this whole thing works being a joint heir with Christ what do you have we have he said so himself the things I did how point-blank can you get the things and the works I have done you will do well you forgot the first part you will do also okay these are just the works you got to do the works say we got to do the works then we get to do the greater say it louder okay like you're excited well I don't just try things I actually do them there's a difference I'm just gonna try that means you're not making much of a plan about that right but doing it the works I did you will do they do also and greater works you will do I think that means we're socially doing something we're entering into a busy season a busy season operating in the supernatural not just talking about it a busy season handling the wealth of the wicked not just talking about it a busy season living not just existing doing the more say the more the more is amazing are you getting better I am just as passionate about living holy as I am about being funny and I will tell you I I have to I have to give you both sides of heaven there's two sides in heaven there's holy profound the other whole half of heaven is funny say funny everybody have they've thought for ever and for ages that it would be boring in heaven maybe because all they do is worship let me tell you you stand in front of him it's not boring whether you're staring feeling like you're going to faint melting to the ground you know you feel like you don't have breath in you because of just being near him yeah it is an honor a privilege and amazing when you worship and it's not normal not even worship as normal in heaven you ride on it you create things as you're worshiping him you're creating when you worship given the devil a big black eye and a very bad day when you worship Him you are shredding bashing and crushing his fake little wannabe Kingdom in the second heaven when you worship Him it's amazing from doing one thing for him to honor him to bless him to adore him what destruction you do against the kingdom of darkness that's my favorite second thing I don't do demons I do do Jesus though I love him I honor him I can't do anything without him it's because of him and with him and it is his plan even the pink hair is his plan because he's not boring there's nothing boring about him there's absolutely nothing boring about heaven there's nothing boring about our future that's like in the next few days the more you believe things are real the more real they will become and that is actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit realm truth the more you believe it is real and talk about it being real and write about it being real and actually acting in it being real the more real it's going to become to you it's the original realm it's the eternal realm it's not the temporary realm this is a temporary life for you it's a temporary place to live a temporary to do things because this earth is not eternal I know people have worked it out in their own mind with their head research and they're looking up stuff and sometimes assuming because I've read a lot of translations and someone kind of miss it I know because the Holy Spirit shows me those scriptures then he'll show me 30 scriptures of it being translated I take the word for the value it gives it's real it is for us to repair us to accelerate us to propel us into high places you never dreamed of doing things you never dreamed of we are living examples of the Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth that's why you're here you here to be like them look like them and act like them I don't see any failure in any of that I don't see hopelessness worthlessness I don't see fear at all one of the first things the Holy Spirit gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what we decided to call him there's so many we don't know what to call and we didn't just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a Kingdom quote was don't let fear interfere that was a good one right teach me never to fear never say never at all in any way fear does not control our life we do not partner with fear he didn't put fear in us when he made us we're supposed to be fearless and timeless everybody should be yelling I receive it say timeless we're supposed to be timeless he said you had to die I'm being serious not funny now serious John didn't have to die did he say no didn't Jesus say to the disciples what is it so in other words he's saying it doesn't matter what they think you probably actually said that he's a character he's the son of God but he is a character the problem with the biggest characters in heaven except for Holy Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by that much who they called the drama King Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit is a drama King you haven't only seen just a little bit of his activity so far waiting to the full fledge release on this earth he's excited he's excited about what's about to happen in us they've been waiting a long time say they've been waiting a long time if I say the word day I mean the Trinity they're not boring none of them they know how to step inside of each other and be one one thing that's how it happens I know I was eight years old father caught me up before the throne and said I'm going to show you how the three can be one and a five-year-old can understand that man's head knowledge has expanded it and expanded it and all kind of could use every other kind of word explaining that you know multiply it whatever you want to call it made it look amazing powerful and hard to understand it's simple they can step inside of each other Jesus said father I pray that one day that they be one even as we are one because he steps inside his father all the time when he was the word he did the same thing I didn't forget I was only on number three bulletins by the way I've got some more I was the least likely person to anyone on this earth would have chosen to do this okay I'm from a tribe like a real one 15 people in an alligator and an iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs and lizards and spiders we grew up with them in our home I had seven brothers what did you think in Florida you add that up that's what that comes to sell your bike to some kid for a pig bring him home wrap him up and close and you have a new pet overnight we never knew what was going to be in our home so I didn't need anyone's opinions I was never part of a group or a clique I had a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a dead person standing before you dead people are wonderful for God to use they're not full of self they don't have their own opinion and the devil cannot use a dead person the more dead you are to yourself the more dangerous you are against hell there are many ways to kill me before I even grew up and you know it doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in this room I loved all my siblings I survived I conquered I was a leader wasn't liked all the time but I was a big help to my parents I honor my parents greatly every day of my life I loved them I didn't want to hurt them they needed help say parents they need help pastors they need more help I'm grateful people can start a church Oh No I've already died I don't need a church I don't need a whole congregations of people although I love them I bless you all but I really bless the pastor because they die every day to be that amen you'll notice that God didn't actually send his son to be a pastor did you ever notice that they actually sent him as a businessman God loves business people they're easy they know how to listen they know how to complete things that are given to them they don't leave things out forget things ignore things they do a job amen so he sent his son as a businessman who could easily connect with the sinners and he did they ate with him all the time they liked him he was exciting he was interesting he was funny his favorite job was to offend the hierarchy he was good at it and yet lived holy did miracles raise the dead they took money from people for spotted lambs they weren't high on God's list and he had to train his disciples I know he only had him for three years and I think most of them finally got it after he left but they did give him credit they did but in the beginning I'm sure Jesus would go to the Father when he went to the mountain all the time and say are you sure I have to that fight all the time they brawl over women I have one who wants to be everything until everybody that that would be Peter I have a treasure you know that cheats all the time right you know that you know he takes money all the time I know you know that too and I have a tax collector and every time you walk down the road to go Minister we get stones thrown at us because they don't like him I don't know anybody who likes tax clusters they didn't back then either so he did not give him the best or the easiest to Train and I know I was saying something to God about my some of my staff and he said I didn't make it easy for my son in my conversation ended with that subject especially when he caught me up me took me back and I got to walk through a whole day of their lives like in their first year of being together all right God I can make it God has a plan for you every single person is important to him and I do know this your birth was timed on this earth God created time he knew you before you were born because you played inside of him he saw you if there was time he saw you all the time how great is see that he was huge he could make himself as big as he wanted to and he walked on the mountains he was out where there was nothing and he spoke and the world would step out of him and make space that God would make himself small enough to step inside himself and play with you he did say he's not a man he's God and even being that great he knew everything about you knew the mistakes knew our faults knew everything that had great hope and great plans for you to do great things so it's no mistake you're here now in this age instead of the ages before this time you're here right on time for the accelerator time for the more of God for the kingdom age for the time to command the hosts of heaven handle the wealth by host cities for him to use because he's not poor he knows the names of your children that you'll have even before you get married he knows them and he put them in your family line on purpose in this generation that's here now this is a special generation for God it's the beginning of the group and type of people that will remain until all things be fulfilled some well the Bible says there'll be a group of people like that a group and type of people a generation that we're generation means a group and type of people it doesn't mean like 30 years or actually that word in the Bible that says Jesus says that there'll be a group and Type O people on earth that will be here when all things be fulfilled including the coming of him that word means a group and type of people that work generation means that there will be a grouping type of people on this earth that also says in the Bible that would taste of the powers say powers of the age to come that would be the Millennial age of course there's people now let's say they're not going to be in millennium I go about what the Bible says there will be a millennium there will be a Tribulation God caused a bump in the road it will happen that's on his timeline in heaven so no matter what other people have come come up with or assume or have putting in translations I promise you it's going to happen and you can't make it happen or not happen anyway so to me it's not worth agreeing over God's gonna work out his plan all the way to the end right I'm excited to know that I'm part of that generation that will tasted the powers of the age to come that's why you need revelation because that that all that comes from the heart of God he already knows what it's going to look like she knows what's gonna happen so he chose you to be here to be a part say Amen that word means so be yet might as well say it gonna happen there's no one on the earth in the earth around the earth say it's round I gotta say that the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so that's him say the earth is round not flat they don't have edges you may say that property does not have edges there you go Holy Spirit truck can we use proper grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it there is a whole group of people that sincerely spend so much time and money to try to prove the earth is flat I'd rather use that money in that time and energy ruling right I've flown many times and I didn't get halfway around the world then all of a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait shh now you're on the other side no I went around besides I've already been up over the earth it's round God made it round he says he sits on the circle of the earth not the square you'd be surprised how serious they are they think NASA has spent billions of dollars faking it and none of that stuff is real I don't know who got that thought but it didn't come from heaven a man so just rest assured that it's around okay been there seen that it is round and when I almost shown it God caught me up in space up and do like like first space not I've been way up there but the first time he caught me up and showed me the earth he put a grid you know like a grid you know what that is yeah a grid was round and he put it right on the earth cheol-ho together and then they begin to draw things on this grid that was his plan that was called space planning that was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out in space put the grid than planned right uses every opportunity to be funny so he did show me his space planning for like the next hundred years that was probably 15 20 years ago when he showed me that that doesn't mean the earth is going to end in a hundred years except been taken further than that and no tribulation had happened I know some people think it's supposed to be right now well if it was it would be people get to heaven they all find out man we wasted so much time sitting on our rapture rug she to roll it up put it in the closet well you've you've been around a long time you realize I went to church everyday it was open and every day someone said Jesus could come tomorrow and in my I'm like little this is like little I had these thoughts why would he have all these plans in the Bible and go okay not forget that we're just all going home I mean he gave my dad a long plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him a long plan I mean he's not going to where we haven't done what God told us to do yet and God said well many people are in fear and they know one day that will happen so they want it to come so to them that's logical they don't understand a lot especially in the book of Revelation say revelations means revelations that means something you don't know so God said I'm calling you a Revelator me you know why he did that so people couldn't call me a false prophet they don't know what a Revelator is so they didn't never say nothing against it they couldn't say well she's not a terrible pastor no he can't call an evangelist she doesn't go out and win lots of millions we can't call her that huh can't call her prophet she's a Revelator don't know what that is so we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is someone who reveals like John did caught up showing the future the future no know what that was that was a bling glitch write that down and don't forget it I know Jen is writing it down right now if I say word she goes you did a bling glitch that means you blended some words together okay I won't explain it yes you've been there I'm sure people been there right you've been there well at least I'm not talking about noses putting the animals on the art tonight that's Moses and Noah doing it together when Donna even said Adam did it I did hear from people I have a bloopers thing one day and just put them all on there go there and look at it but now I forget we're talking about who is listening Revelator you're right so see I hear them all the time I have to fight when you're eight you need help so he didn't pick me to be a professor you know I was graduated middle of my class like literally middle we had six hundred graduating students we have a lot of people coming to Florida to go to school I guess they like it we're pretty laid-back there you know and so it's a nice place to live if you want to come live someplace different go good vacation time try not to come in August really hot so being a Revelator's a little bit different that usually doesn't mean profit just so you've wondered you know John was a men and it's okay I love doing that but I love being with my father my heavenly father him all the time I know why Jesus loved him so much I know why he wanted to be with him I know why he went away to the mountain to spend time with him I know how hard it was for him to leave home and come here okay he was not poor he didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor he became poor when he left heaven because heaven is certainly not poor there's nothing poor up there nothing splendor and wandering beauty you couldn't afford to build the house that you're mentioned that your mother lives in you wouldn't even have the right substances to make it the walls sing literally they sing they leave you go on tours come back they sing hello to them the trees uproot their self and they come and sit in your house and be your friend for a while they'll go back to the friendly forest is this ok it's not gonna be normal no you can't be normal you've been going to heaven for 20 years you be normal to heaven they tell funny stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped most people when they go there no matter how they were here they're all happy they love jokes they love to tell funny stories hear funny stories they love it they make plans for people before they come they knew Paul was coming they all knew Paul is coming there's a place you go in heaven where you find that out and you go in this beautiful amazing building and these supernatural monitors much better than ours but these are good and you can see who's coming home who's about to come home to heaven everybody starts getting things ready they're so excited they're there beside their self they want to make sure they're all there say all to meet you at the gate they have a huge celebration they plan one themselves heaven plans one the throne room plans one people have celebrations in the street over someone coming home stay home it's because that's where you came from we were alone to the earth for a while when you go home you are really home and you're not dead they don't throw parties for people who aren't alive they have huge celebrations lots of music lots of food everyone meeting one another visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't taking you himself sometimes he does take people he comes into his own chariot flaming horses picks you up and takes you up to heaven then when you get out you see the sea or the mass of people waiting to greet you and then Jesus walks you up the steps of the throne to give you back to the Father and then the father reaches out of that glory that moves in and out of him the Living colors of the bow coming in and out his eyes flames of fire passion for you just glowing and he reaches his arms out and grabs you he says welcome home my son welcome home my daughter you go home as his children say we are his offspring every morning gets their own mansion you don't have to share it with your brother or sister I'll have my own one day it's made exactly the way you would love it but it's made with his presence in the walls and the floors and it's not gonna be a normal shape trust me it's not all your pets to be there they'll be waiting to greet you eating your food at your table your family members will all have gifts for you for every year you've been apart they will get a gift that represents that year and put it in your mansion after your welcome home party in the throne room which could last for quite a while your family will come get you and take you to your own mansion then they'll have another celebration everybody laughs and filled with joy to see all the ones they loved before little tiny babies they never got to raise they get their children given to them to raise the same one that you that didn't make it all the way through amen God keeps them they live with your grandparents or whoever when they get there they'll go get them and help raise them for a while I love the story of a mother they lost their son he was either 7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of course they they grieved over him but knew he was in heaven and I think it was like 20 years later or 30 years later one of the other huh she died on the operating table and was caught up to heaven saw her seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom you're here this is so exciting your mom I'm so glad you're here and you cuz what have you been doing goes I've been playing with my friends what you think I've been doing he's been living with his grandfather and playing with all these friends and the streets to go they were playing and he was laughing and he said but you can't come yet because it's not your time and so she came back never forgot it and her and her husband went around the world talking about it you will be known as you are known except you look better like a whole lot better you'll have hair most guys wear their hair about down to their shoulders don't have you know that's gonna change y'all I'm just letting you know I can't change guys unless you really want like a buzz cut or something no Marine Corps or my husband may still have one I would might be surprised to see him alive yeah he's still with me by the way another way to kill me but that was okay it's all worth everything it's worth it all no matter what you surrender give up miss doing it's worth it and you'll be so happy when you stand before God and you're welcomed home knowing that you gave everything you could not saying you have to walk around poor okay that was the devil's plan not God's his plan is to bless us say bless us and prosper us it'll be worth it some people have already seen Jesus here right how many people have seen Jesus let me see either in a vision or dream or in reality if you've seen him how many people have been encountered an angel there's usually a lot there's a lot of people here it's going to happen that's part of the acceleration that's part of the more it's a lot of them more actually that we will see angels and they will probably be talking to us they came from God ignore what we've all been told our whole lives don't talk to angels they did in the Bible amen there's gonna be a lot more of that angelic not just visitation because what we're going to experience is the habitation heavens not coming for a visit a heaven is not coming for a visit they're coming for a habitation you're part of the habitation you are all of you sitting here say I'm alive and breathing I'm part of the habitation but God is about to do on this earth does not just take a territory here and there what the habitation will be is in us say in us that's the part of the habitation that's why me and won't be able to control it like they have in the past say God will be in charge it's a habitation and it will remain for a long time he's gonna transform this world right now he is shifting government so he can shape Nations it's part of the platform he's giving us in the habitation he's got platforms for us that's the place that we will operate from and speak from shake things cause things to be released to change for him it's not a lot of how it's always been in the past that's why it's a new thing say a new thing it's time for the new thing it's where we will be ruling it's one of the purposes that Christ died for us that's why he went into hell and wasted it took back the authority and Dominion the Adam had given away he gave it to us he also gave his power over all the power of the enemy say we have power over all the power of the enemy say he did not give that to the Angels that's why we need to command them they can't just go tear up any demon they see they just can't do that they do it in in the past it was from answers to prayer and prayers never going to go away it's never gonna go away he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's gonna get even more powerful especially when you command part of an army of heaven and they pull down strongholds for you and crush the plains of darkness we need this say we need it to rule in this day say every King gets the Kingdom and gets an army if we're part of the kingdom we get part of the army did you ever see a king a natural King on this earth title rule with that one they wouldn't go very far with a they'd be overrun beaten up things stolen things killed someone's like the devil he comes to kill steal and destroy that's what the army prevents heavens army was designed created and made every one of them unique and different but they are fierce they have one job the ones under Gabriel have many different jobs many different positions to do many different things but but Michael is over one specific part and that is the army they have a headquarters they have barracks they have training fields they're all in the sky of heaven Rand maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus would go send up Michael to gather the army from the far ends of heaven to fight on behalf of Israel people say Amen it's in the Bible go read it sometimes they even fought the flesh did you know that yeah some of them could fight the flesh in this time on earth it's mostly battles in the spirit battling the demonic even those in the high places the principalities and the powers the things the beings in wickedness in high places many of those high places will be shredded and pulled down say our weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds that's one of the things the army does I can only share what I have been told and I can only tell you what I have been shown shown and told that's what I talk about but they didn't just show me things and tell me things I had to live it every way something mom is trained in it was for the body of Christ so I had to live it to let you know it's real and it really does work she follow heavens protocol see on earth as it is in heaven that's what we've been asking for for generations we should have expected it jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told me is it I knew if I taught them that and said you say that eventually it would come you mean one thing I could get them to agree on no matter what denomination they rod to clear that prayer because they need us to call things in is that right you have not because you ask not if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give you anything you want no matter what it is where it is what time it is I give you permission to use me as anyone ever says something like that let me see your hands well I'll get ready because he's calling in those words yes it's gonna be amazing say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna be amazing here we can live on earth like they live in heaven which is mainly his will being done his way say his way not our way that's part of the more she's gonna do new thing he goes revelation and then ways for you to use that revelation it means a lot of things are gonna change so if you're stuck in your own mind or your own mindset of what you think is gonna happen and because it didn't it's not going to you need to just so that away because he does have a timeline in his own throne room and those dots on that timeline is when his things are going to happen regardless of what anybody on the earth is doing it's his sovereign will and what right now this time we're in it's on his timeline it is many of the generals are going home doesn't mean they'll be oblivious to what we're doing that means they'll know all about it after they get there and the thing they'll be celebrating is us who are still down here being a part of it so God really needs us right now he's intimidating me although I probably would have never chosen except when he asked me I said yes say it's important to say yes to being chosen many are called but few are chosen because they don't choose that's why many aren't chosen he can't make you do it right you're called you're being called but he can't make you do that you have to choose yes and when you do that you're saying yes I want to be chosen and then you're chosen what does it take to be chosen say choose yes then you got to be willing he makes it a little bit you know gotta be willing and obedient say willing obedience next say surrender is not control a lot of people think it is because you know God does have he does have I'm trying to think of the natural earthward it's like not there he does have guidelines is that right even Jesus had them that he operated by Jesus didn't just pick things on his own all the time where did he say I do yeah what his father said right but he showed him and what he told him that's what he did that's why we need revelation otherwise we're gonna get man's mind set on everything and that hasn't worked well has it he's not going to abandon the church I've heard all kinds of things when people's gonna abandon the church it's just gonna go away burn down we don't need it anymore let's get rid of it when he's not saying that to me he's going to set it on fire amen this is a time to be willing and obedient if you want to eat the fat of the land and Jesus did ask us to pray about one other thing pray that my people say we are his people be willing and the day of his power well obviously if he's going to give us revelation to operate like he does and part of that is power he says he'll give you power over all the part of the enemy there's one right there he's given us power and he does have power so if this is the day of his power the biggest thing the most important thing is remember the willing and obedient thing what he asked probably won't seem natural or normal to you wasn't natural normal to ask me to have pink hair I wasn't a pink haired person I liked it he wouldn't have asked me it's better than camel hair I like pink here any day over camel hair it smells it's stiff not comfortable and he had to wrap himself in it okay my pink hair is a test it divides asunder the Spirit from the flesh so those who trash or bash it or in the flash are we still so walking the flash say no we're supposed to walk in the so people don't have to tell me if they're hearing their flesh or hearing their spirit it's the way they react to the pink care now people who like pink hair they think is amazing so the world must be passing their tests because they all love it that's amazing you look amazing what do you do I'm a spokesperson for haven't I've been there and then they all say the same thing they don't say you're liar your father's property was that they go what was it like what was it like is it beautiful is it amazing is it real is is God real is there a god and go oh yes there is a God and you lived inside of him before you came here okay that makes him interested not bashing amen try that next time you did live in him you moved in and out of him he was your very existence you had your very existence in him that's why he knew you that's why he saw you before he sent you here you're wonderfully and perfectly made your souls were the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's Revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well I'm missing that no Adam became a living Saint loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to God that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life it's probably one of the least talked about things in the church it's a soul growing up I always heard that it was bad and went but God made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with God and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your souls fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody you wound and hurt eunuch stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand I was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time I never usually know but I looked at my clock and I was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it look like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause her soul to prosper all the time and then they live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that where B means lib it's called divine health so I since I learned about the father taught me about that he said people can loose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you loose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can loose from your soul and he said I know most people buying the devil but the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talked about the loosing thing what are gonna do with the loosing key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of God to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about God will never be taken from you and so people I know you know if you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it I'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue in your anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all it comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to loose that's that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of God as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming home you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're gonna do some spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll be excited you mean leaving an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're gonna have some fire sent the Angels already outside waiting but they're gonna do that tomorrow night I did this recently where I mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time just darkening I want to say drops of it the fire of God is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our God is a consuming fire I'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of Christ send the fire I want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart I mean literally make sure your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with God the fire it burns it out then he puts him in selves in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from God two stones a fire I find a one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that Satan left on some other planet that was in a Bible and I already knew what they were so God made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they were inside God or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the River of Life that's in him the river flows out of him the gemstones flow out of him even the steps of the throne room have gemstones they flow out of heaven and become the crystal see is called the crystal see because there's gemstones in it not sand that's why it's cut crystal faceted gemstones they're all over heaven they all come from one place when the father and the firewood burn inside of him and Lucifer would step in and there's his holy mountain inside God say God is not a man he doesn't look the same inside that we do but we lived there that's why we like sparkly things way back in our way back in our spirit man we remember that we met we remember that there's something that connects when we look at something that's brilliant and beautiful gemstones represent the love of God his love his revelation upon this rock I know he said Peter was a rock when God says rock in the Bible he's talking about a gemstone you know that white rock that white rock rock or stone you're gonna get when you go home to heaven and there's a name under the only he and you know it's a white diamond it's not a River Rock every syllabus I ever saw showed a river rock when it talked about that that stone so inside his eternity you never see at the end there's no end inside of him no end and we ran up and down this mountain and we slid down the river of life and would jump on the stones of fire through the flames we lived in those flames you're about to get baptized with him it's amazing I don't even know what time it is I better check what time is it oh my my see gem she's at it you didn't finish talking about Ron McClellan remember I was at his service right and I can I come in with these books in his parents and grandparents are sitting on the front row I didn't know him so but I knew a couple people there at celebration Church they let me come in and I just was going to wait till everything was over and they were everybody with their line going by the casket and he had this bright yellow suit on I mean bright with his big white tie and and he had the biggest fro I've ever seen on a human they had to stick it down in the casket and as I was walking I was walking up I looked up I was trying not to laugh out loud because it was an open portal and he was watching his service and now this is a band right band in a van travelling telling jokes non-stop doing sock puppets you know crazy stuff he did crazy things in the van with the guys and his band was there and they were telling the funniest stories and every time they say something funny he would go like this is here we go so here I'm looking at the casket and then I look up there he was alive for now and there was a lot of funny stories right so I'm like this is just this crazy it was so much fun and so I went back sat down and then it came up when I gave out the books and I didn't know who his parents were I knew who his wife was and her mom dad were there and I gave them one and I didn't know that was his father sitting there so I was telling you know his wife this is a book about heaven I really think it a bless you and I started to turn away and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take an extra one so of course willing and obedient I had an extra one in a little bag wondering who was gonna give it to and he grabbed my arm II said did you say that book was about heaven I said yes I I've been there he says can I have that book and I said yes yes you can have and he goes well I'm Randstad well was then this was for you because I didn't know you were gonna be here but he told me to bring it so this is your book and a few months later I get a phone call it's always in the middle of night and it's his parents and they're undone they were so full of joy in celebration after reading about what heaven was like they already knew what their son would be doing having a band and he does have a man and it's called the other side of the story his heaven he went from story side be to the other side of the story that was his bayum but in the band angels were playing and singing with him because he said he wouldn't let anyone take the place of his band when they came to heaven which I told their band and so his parents called they were really excited about everything and and then I they gave me their daughter's phone number he and his sister were really close together and so I called and just spoke to her for a few minutes and and then about I don't know it was probably a year later she called me she goes today is my birthday my 30th birthday and I just wanted to know does my brother even remember me does he still think about me because we had planned a big celebration on this day we didn't know he'd go home so I while she's on the phone to me God caught me up to heaven and I saw her brother standing at a portal this goes sound wild but it didn't matter he was throwing Cheetos at her from the portal and he was singing the worst rendition of happy birthday I've ever heard and this is a guy who sings sent was singing for a living right like me and this that's awful that's awful and then God sends me back and I'm she's still going on the phone I said wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to you hey I don't know what you can think about this but I got to tell you what what I just saw in heaven I saw your brother and he was throwing Cheetos over the portal at you and she starts to yell and scream she goes that that's she said he even had a throw by he run by what do you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he had her fro to so he said his greatest thing to do was run through the room and throw as many Cheetos in her fro that would stick there and she said he did it all the time and I was so irritated but now it's the most precious thing in the world that you told me that because I know he didn't forget me this is on her birthday remember and I said oh I don't know how to tell you this but he he sounded the worst I have ever heard for someone who's anointed to sing she said was it the worst happy birthday you ever heard in your life I want ya she said he did that every year too so she was so blessed to find out she that he had not changed he still remembered her he was still himself and she was so blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen I finished the story I'm done with okay so I want to encourage you to understand that your family still loves you no one has forgotten you they're making plans for you in this little vapor of time that we're in right now on this earth use it powerfully to love to forgive and to be willing and obedient understand John his last message loved one another that should be the thing we do the most amen don't forget to love if you get a choice forgive people who are bashing you when you do that it really does wound the demons and it is our time to torment the Nieman's say it's our honor and privilege to torment the demons those demons ask Jesus have you come to torment just before our time that meant that was going to be a time when they would be tormented is that right but he didn't do that he gave us power right so stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul is still enjoying his celebration party it goes on for quite a while I know that has something spent planned for him for anyone who ever wanders he made it no matter what you thought about his life or consider for him he loved God he had Christ in his heart he made mistakes he repented for them amen and he's highly honored and recognized in heaven for what he did for God and they're happy to have him home and so is his mom amen so let's make a declaration I love to make declarations say father thank you for timing my birth on the earth for right now I expect to receive the more to live in the more to be the more it is my commission I'm saying yes right now I want to be chosen help me to be willing and obedient and laugh while I do it I asked for and receive lots of fun I need fun heaven has fun on earth as it is in heaven I want to be dangerous against hell the enemy is my doormat but I am a ruler with Jesus Christ I am royalty I am your son or daughter this is the time I've been waiting for amen amen sit down do people have children here okay yeah I don't want to run too late that I don't get to lay hands on them if you have children so maybe in a few minutes I don't know what time do they pick them up okay wherever they are okay yeah I really want you given I know I'm gonna do an impartation tomorrow night I really would like to do one tonight I [Applause] think instead of talking for another 45 minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm probably getting the lightning power God last time I did it John G showed up that's who I call John G Lake he did he came and stood right next to me other seers saw him it was really zap BAM time but tonight I really want to give out a measure of the fire amen I've had a measure of baptism and fire and let me tell you I've not ever been the same so I want you to take it home with you let it burn on the inside of you don't let the fire go out what you're really doing is preparing a place for more to come say more say when I receive some of something from God I can have more I know there's major things that are about to happen in your lives shifts because this is the time to shift there's a lot of shifts the other thing is suddenly those are two different things a suddenly comes when you least expect it but just one suddenly can change your life it will fill you so full of faith when God moves his hand for you it's always a good thing say suddenly are good things because God is preparing you to receive more of him amen suddenly just send you over the edge probably about half the time suddenly czar about finances or wealth like a lot not like wow someone gave me a hundred dollars like a lot we've had quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm asking God to give you some of those also amen so when I when I heart fire to you I'm gonna add suddenly okay say I want the Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting ready for them I'm serious I really wanted God I'm a suddenly son or daughter so send it there you go now you set yourself up so I just want to get ready to lay hands on people it doesn't matter how old you are you can have a suddenly and you can also have the fiery men I see some kids running around they're gonna be fierce I'm talking about children yeah I have several grandchildren that already are fierce so I expect them to be fierce amen say fierce is a good word in this more time of God it's passionate remember the word says we take it by force so don't do don't be mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to take it by force amen in the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and encourages for us to be fierce amen and dangerous and violent say violence in the spirit realm is a good thing when we have it that word suffers does not mean that heavens being beat up by somebody however back to the translations God said go read some of the translations and see how they have translated or interpreted that verse from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take up by force and it literally said people are running into heaven and stealing things I don't know where they got that heaven is under attack no I don't believe that for a second it's us who are supposed to be violently passionate against the enemy and we had the right to take back whatever he has taken from us because he had no right to it Amen I love giving revelation in the word - it actually makes sense amen training up your child and the gift God put in them whether it's a drummer or a baker or an interior designer in the never depart from that gift because they'll be doing the thing they love the most that word in there says train up a child in the Ben or the way he made them that means who he sent you as what gift he made you and sent you here every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights and God said everybody sits on the few of the chair every Sunday trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is but one of the most important gifts he gave you is your natural gift your passion what you love what he made you to be or do in this earth that's not your job it's the thing you're the most passionate about you know your child is a drummer if they beat everything everything they have they beat on the table with it you know straw spoons forks whatever it is you buy them a farm you know the farm is set for Christmas and they pick them up and start beating on something with them the cow and the horse here they go take them in a restaurant they use the straws take them outside so they'll be quiet and then they break branches off the bush and start drumming with the bush say I think they're a drummer so raise them up as a drummer and they'll never run around the world trying to figure out who they are does that scripture make sense it's a revelation that's how important your natural gift is because when you go to heaven he plans to use it it's irrevocable you meant to be a baker make the best brownies or whatever it is you make everybody in the neighborhood loves them that everybody tells you to sell them when you go home to heaven you're going to make that and everybody will have it for free and everybody will love you they have rodeos amusement parks because people have gifts that do that is that right that's why we have fun in heaven and it's so natural they walk in heaven and here's all the stuff they need to design and to put together something that won't take forever to make it you're gonna be a baker as part of your mansion you have a full out kitchen with supernatural devices to use and all the supplies you need and then out in the front you have a bakery where everybody comes body your stuff Jesus will visit you regularly he has a sweet tooth that's why he liked honeycomb remember we served on the beach to his disciples remember he served him a meal he gave them what fish and say honey when it is cousin eat locusts and it ran in the family say I'm in the family now I know why I have a sweet tooth amen okay we're going to we're going to do this amen so I guess you can get people organized unless I tell everybody to come one row at a time and I'm gonna come down here you're gonna walk up to me I'm gonna just zap you with the fire God and then what do you want them to do next you want him to come and sit yeah Margaret stone I couldn't do this without mark or actually my team really I have a team I have like 15 people now I don't do this by myself amen every now and then I go okay I'm sending you this time you get up on the platform and speak and so I really do bless my team God gave me man using teams in this time the day the lone ranger is coming to a close amen we're going to need each other we're gonna work together amen and so I'm gonna give this microphone to somebody and then we'll come down here and lay hands on you don't forget to come tomorrow night it's gonna be amazing exciting walk sideways you'll never fall and then I'm gonna declare of declare our blessing over you when we're when we're done okay unless I should do it first because I don't know what you want them to do next do the blessing first that would be really wise because some of you may not be walking hold your hands Oh father I ask you as your daughter that loves you forever and you love everyone here it is your heart to bless to inspire to empower to get ready for some of the greatest days this earth will ever experience I'm asking you from my heart to theirs to bless them abundantly

let them have an experience part of the suddenly that are coming to them let them have the more that we've been talking about not just in money and lands buildings but in Revelation and restoration and healings divine health everyone say I receive it I want them to have that on top of whatever measure the fire you want to give them God let them begin to burn for you don't drive if it happens I mean in the middle of the night sometimes it comes we've had people call us what am I gonna do enjoy it but I'm burning I've been in the shower five times and I'm still burning with let it burn it's from heaven it's gonna be okay I'm laughing I'm dancing I'm like what if what do I do I said just enjoy it this is from your father this is a gift it's a gift so this is the time for suddenly regardless of age regardless of their denomination or nondenomination regardless of their position in life regardless of what people think of them just because you love them I ask you to bless them

come here okay he was not poor he didn't live poor say jesus was not poor he became poor when he left heaven because heaven is certainly not poor there's nothing poor up there nothing splendor wonder and beauty you couldn't afford to build the house that your mansion that your mother lives in you won't even have the right substances to make it the walls sing literally they sing they leave you go on tours come back they sing hello to them the trees uproot themselves and they come and sit in your house and be your friend for a while to go back to the friendly forest is this okay it's not going to be normal no you can't be normal if you've been going to heaven for 20 years you'd be normal to heaven they tell funny stories a lot bob jones hasn't stopped most people when they go there no

to meet you at the gate they have a huge celebration they they plan on themselves heaven plans one the throne room plans won a people have celebrations in the street over someone coming home say home it's because that's where you came from we were loaned to the earth for a while when you go home you're really home and you're not dead they don't throw parties for people who aren't alive [Laughter] they have huge celebrations lots of music lots of food everyone meeting one another visiting jesus welcomes you if he isn't taking you himself sometimes he does take people he comes in his own chair flaming horses picks you up and takes you up to heaven then when you get out you see the sea and the mass of people waiting to greet you and then jesus walks you up the steps of the throne to give you back to the father and then the father reaches out of that glory that moves in and out of him the living colors of the bow coming in and out his eyes flames of fire passion for you he's just glowing and he reaches his arms out and grabs you he says welcome home my son i welcome home my daughter you go home as his children say we are his offspring everyone gets their own mansion you don't have to share it with your brother or sister i'll have my own one day it's made exactly the way you would love it but it's made with his presence in the walls and the floors and it's not going to be a normal shape trust me it's not all your pets will be there they'll be waiting to greet you eating your food at your table your family members will all have gifts for you for every year you've been apart they will get a gift that represents that year and put it in your mansion after your welcome home party in the throne room which could last for quite a while your family will come get you and take you to your own mansion then they'll have another celebration everybody laughs and filled with joy to see all the ones they loved before little tiny babies they never got to raise they get their children given to them to raise the same one that you that didn't make it all the way through amen god keeps them they live with your grandparents or whoever when they get there they'll go get them and help raise them for a while i love the story of a mother they lost their son he was either seven or eight he was hit by a car and they of course they they grieved over him but knew he was in heaven and i think it was like 20 years later or 30 years later one of the other she died on the operating table and was caught up to heaven saw her seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold he goes mom wow mom you're here this is so exciting your mom i'm so glad you're hearing she goes what have you been doing goes i've been playing with my friends what do you think i've been doing he'd been living with his grandfather and playing with he all these friends in the streets of gold they were playing and he was laughing and he said but you can't come yet because it's not your time and so she came back never forgot it and her and her husband went around the world talking about it you will be known as you are known except you'll look better like a whole lot better you'll have hair most guys that wear their hair about down to their shoulders don't have you know that's going to change y'all i'm just letting you know it's going to change guys unless you really want like a buzz cut or something no marine corps my husband may still have one i might be surprised to see him here he's still with me by the way another way to kill me but that was okay it's all worth everything

thankful to him for this opportunity which i never expected in my life thankful to you cat i want to tell you one thing you know actually i wanted to conduct this meeting in the office in my office but you know what happened there was some construction work going on near my office and all the cables were cut off the internet cables and everything were cut off in the evening and you know i am doing this actually in my house now can you actually pray and decree and declare over the frequencies and the airwaves of the internet right now so that we will not be having any interruptions can you please yes yes father we thank you for this time together god to connect your word and your will to the people in india and we take power over all the power of the enemy no matter what situation that is we will not tolerate interference or interruption in any way whatsoever not in the broadcast not in the sound not in the receiving of it in any way whatsoever in jesus name we come in the host of heaven you go pull down all those strongholds that would interfere with this amen because this is your will this is your plan and we say yes to that so we ask you to bless it in the name of jesus christ and we thank you father for this opportunity amen amen amen thank you so much ma'am and once again i really appreciate you for your time so all right i have a few questions later you know you can talk about the plans that god has uh you know for this earth so without any delay can we get into the questions now or you have anything to say oh no i'm just ready i'm excited thank you so much all right cat can you brief us on heaven how does the heaven look like and its operations when i say its operations what what is the assignment of the angels what does the 24 elders would do what is the assignment of the seraphims and the cherubims and redeemed souls and the unredeemed souls so how exactly how does the father look like and what are their operations actually in the heaven i can tell you're very excited you have a lot of questions yes yes i do heaven is beyond uh the beauty of heaven is is filled with wonder and splendor every part of it now there's amazing parts those profound parts like the throne room of god where you will actually see the seraphim they dip down out of this glory cloud over his throne they're continually worshipping him and the people are in there also the redeemed souls the people are in there worshiping all the time but they have many other things to do that god prepared for all of us to to enjoy our lives in heaven to be with our families and to meet some of the apostles and the and the prophets i mean they're there you can actually see them and meet them there but there's such honor for each other i think one of the most outstanding things i noticed when i was there how much everybody honored one another there's nobody up there that's going to reject you and nobody's going to hold anything against you you know jesus christ died for all of us and when we receive him as our savior that is going to be our home that will become our home one day amen yeah and so there's many beautiful things to see and do around heaven uh the the cherubim of course they're around the throne of god all the time declaring holy holy holy the throne is kind of high and lifted up it's in the middle of the throne room it's not like way on the back wall then nobody can see uh the father or the son they're right in the middle so people can come up there and see them whenever they want to and they will hold you and tell you how much they love you and they're so glad that you've come home to heaven it's just a beautiful place there's waterfalls everywhere in heaven filled with green light and these beautiful angels step out of the waterfalls they have different tribes of angels are created in tribes some take care of the forest the waterfalls some serve in the throne room many you will get to meet when you go to heaven your guardian angel goes back to heaven when you go there the army of heaven is in a different area of heaven and those angels they call the hosts they're very powerful and right now they have flooded this earth right now in this very time that i'm speaking and they're here to protect us they're here to defend us against the enemy our enemy is satan satan hates everybody he has no friends he doesn't even like his own demons and right now when people act like satan is because they're being controlled by him but right now uh where our heavenly home is waiting on us from the moment that you're born on earth when god sends you from himself to earth to be born he begins to work on your mansion so it's not like he does nothing then all of a sudden you show up there uh it may take many years or even generations to finish building your mansion because it's so beautiful and amazing in heaven but when it's done when your mansion is done that's when you're going to go home to heaven sometimes it's when you're very old sometimes it's not when you're old but no one there is no fear in heaven everyone will know you they'll know you by your name and so these mansions are just unspeakably beautiful they're not made by human hands they're not made by humans who died and moved there they're made by jesus christ and by his father and i'm sure some of the angels are also involved with building helping to embellish the mansions but you they will help you find your way all around heaven to see other beautiful things that god put there but his very presence jesus's very presence in heaven is felt no matter where you are there is a way that everyone can be with him individually uh many times he'll walk around the masses in heaven the beautiful thing is even the flowers will sing to jesus christ so heaven is a little bit different than this earth like uh the creatures which we would call animals on the earth many of them also worship even the ocean in heaven the crystal sea even it worships jesus christ and you will walk over these rainbow bridges uh to get to the other side even the sea creatures worship everything worships the lord in heaven and so uh people get so undone when they first go there when you get to heaven your family members will be waiting on you and trust me if you belong to jesus christ there's no way that you won't go to heaven you have to understand of course that that is the only way to heaven is through the blood of jesus christ and he is aware of what's going on down here he's with us all the time even while we're here and so the throne room is one of the most beautiful places in heaven uh there's like gold golden the stone is like gold the rainbow moves in and out of the father you see all the waves of the rainbow moving in and out of him it's very beautiful to experience just being in his presence and you really understand that he is your father in heaven and that he did send his son to die for all of us here on this earth so i have to say love and love is probably the most wonderful thing all over heaven everything is just bathed in love you'll never feel alone you're never concerned um everything that you you need is given to you and there's also places to go in heaven that god made for us to enjoy there's beautiful art being even people can like paint the skies of heaven you don't have to just paint like a canvas uh so many ways that people can do things in heaven that we can't do on this earth and god prepared all of that for us the bible says in my father's house are many mansions and i've seen many many of those mansions in heaven some are very different um a lot of people would like to be like near the mountains so the mansions could be built in the mountains in heaven or by the crystal sea many people's mansions are built there uh it's just a beautiful place and i know there's peace i know there's peace because christ is there you have no more laborers you know you get to use the gift that god made you to be on the earth if you work with fabric you'll do it in heaven and make beautiful things for jesus christ and other people when they come to heaven they'll make beautiful things that that you can put in your mansion there's no money in heaven so nothing cost anything all these things are freely given or made by people and that's their delight to do that so you're never going to have an argument in heaven you're not going to be rejected in heaven it's just the most wonderful place that you would want to be and there with your family members even all the little babies are there waiting on their parents to get there those that didn't make it all the way to birth so it is beyond your imagination and that and yet we all have a loving father we have the same loving father in heaven and when you go home you go home as his son or his daughter and he's already made that beautiful place for you if anybody has recently lost somebody i don't know why they use the word lost because if you're going to heaven you're not lost okay you're moving it's like you're moving from this place into a beautiful place in heaven being somewhat i tell people that's how we need to look at it just like that that we're moving your body may be sleeping but your spiritual body inside of you looks just like you it's young and uh there's nothing no sickness no disease no handicap people in heaven everyone is made whole and so it's just really everybody celebrates in heaven even when one person comes home there they celebrate so it's really a beautiful place thank you thank you so much you know cat i was listening i have been listening to you since 2012. maybe you may not know about it but i was i know every uh every i have covered every session of yours every session i know all the answers you know for all the questions that i have jotted down but the thing is i want all my indian friends and the believers to know about heaven to know about god the characteristics of god hallelujah so the second question is can you talk about trinity and brief us on each personality father son and the holy spirit yes well i think one of the most wonderful times i was caught up to heaven the father wanted to show me what the trinity was because everyone knows that they call themselves the three in one yeah the triune godhead and that actually means there are three individual beings that have the ability to go inside of each other i know it's a satin strange but this is exactly how he showed me he caught me up and there was a father sitting on the throne there was jesus christ next to him and the holy spirit and i know he's sort of invisible but you can see the fire going around him or bands of color so you know that is holy spirit right there he actually does have a body on earth that would be invisible in heaven not not so much invisible and the father said here we are three individual beings father son and holy spirit all three are gods and he said and then he said my son will step inside of me so jesus got up and stepped right inside of his father and then the holy spirit came and stepped inside of the father and the father said now we are the three and one so the three separate beings all of them gods and our gods and so jesus christ came you know to die for our sins the father is the one who carries all of life in him and when the baby is born on the earth at the time of conception holy spirit brings that little baby spirit that's living inside the father literally and he brings it and knits it and attaches it to the mother's womb now many people know the scripture says i knit you together in your mother's womb but they don't know that means a literal he really does that little spiritual being that's you gets attached at the time of conception and then your body and your spirit will become one until of course the day that you die and when you die the mystery about that is this body remains behind but your spiritual self that is you that you really can touch feel eat enjoy yourself in heaven that is taken home by your own angel takes you back to heaven and gives and jesus takes you and gives you back to the father and so jesus is probably the king of course he's the king he's more of the the warrior type but he also loves not each one of them love but they each have a different thing that they mainly do the father carries life inside of himself the rainbow is generated from inside himself it says lightnings and thunders come from him but those lightnings in heaven that come from him are love they're like love and so holy spirit of course he carries he is the spirit of god and he comes down to this earth and he he he you know calls people to become to a savior i mean a savior he calls you to the savior so that you can become born again the holy spirit also comes alongside you when you're on the earth and he helps to guide you and he shows you the word of god and so he also will fill you with himself and then you can speak in that heavenly language you can speak in tongues and actually when you speak in tongues that's a language when you speak in tongues and you pray in tongues the enemy the devil cannot understand what you're saying it's like a part of heaven that gets put in you and you communicate directly with the father with the son with the holy spirit so holy spirit definitely causes all kind of drama on the earth when uh you know when he moves upon people to draw you to christ and there's going to be a lot of movement of the holy spirit on the earth right now drawing many people to jesus christ so they each have a different type of a personality uh but they're all still god amen amen thank you so much right uh how often you go to heaven can everyone go heaven and if yes how i am just caught up usually by the spirit of god unless jesus comes in person and just takes me i'm not taken in this physical body my physical body stays behind my spiritual body is taken up to heaven whenever they want to show me something or teach me something to teach believers on the earth sometimes they'll take me forward in time and show me something that's going to happen it's almost always good news i'm not one of the prophets that maybe be shown great destruction and wicked things you know so that people are warned by that god shows me the celebrations the moves of god his plans for different parts of the earth right now he's moving over the whole earth it could be any time i usually go more than once a day most days and sometimes they'll just jesus would like walk through the wall of my room and you'll sit and talk with me and i know some people that sound strange it's normal it's like breathing to me it's as simple as breathing i don't cause it to happen i have a i have a commission to be a revealer i reveal heaven to the earth so therefore they call me a revelator and uh holy spirit has caught me up the father has caught me up jesus has caught me up at different times and usually i will be like if i was sitting here and all of a sudden they came and took me i would just sit here and not speak my body would just remain here if my husband comes looking for me and i'm not moving or saying anything he'll just say well i'll come back later and then he leaves and whatever god's doing with me he waits of course to avenge his then he come back and he just sticks my spirit back in my body and i've seen many places in heaven or you show me things about to come on the earth and i'm like i feel like a little child when i'm up there so when he speaks to me he doesn't speak to me in big words that people would have a hard time understanding he speaks to me like i'm about eight years old i feel like i'm about eight years old when i'm in heaven i'm always excited i'm always happy i'm always blessed that they allow me to do that and they've been doing it for over 20 years so i stopped counting a long time ago it's not about how many times he took me it's the purpose he wanted me to go is so that people would know that he he exists that he loves them how heaven operates was the right word to use because they do have a way to operate god puts a gift in every person when he brings us here to the earth when we come here as those little spirits we are have a like my gift actually is a photographer and it is my passion it's what i think about all the time unless he's showing me things to talk about i want to take pictures i love it i know that when i go to heaven one day i will have my own studio and there'll be even more fantastic ways to make photographs so even though i i'm a prophet and a revelator and of course i have many other things that god asked me to do but my number one gift besides being a daughter of god and you know um a believer in jesus christ is a photographer so whatever that passion maybe you like to work with fabric maybe maybe you like to bake things or or create things or design things and you love that that's not necessarily a talent it's something that you were just born with to do maybe it's singing mine is not singing but i can share i'm taken and i have a photographic memory which means i remember everything i saw all the words i heard the music i heard if i tasted food what did that taste like and so i store all that in my soul and it just stays there i don't forget it so i don't have a very normal job of course it's not but i'm just sharing with everybody what they also will experience one day when they go to heaven and that's really the father's purpose for taking me and i've seen so many i've seen thousands of places in heaven and uh there's different areas actually that god has things in heaven like valley the falls or passionate paradise is about worshiping christ there's a friendly forest i could just go on and on the mountain of spices i've seen all these beautiful places in heaven and then he asked me to write a book i didn't plan to write a book jesus came in person to me and said the father and i want you to write books about heaven so people on this earth will know it's real that it's not something that's made up is something that we want to invite them all to be a part of you know by receiving of course christ saying this by receiving me as your savior christ as your savior and so that's why i get taken but as far as when i get taken i could be pulling in my driveway and i turn the car off and they take me i could be in the grocery store reaching for something on the shelf and in the time it would take someone to put their hand on that thing and then hesitate for a second and then put it in their cart i could have been maybe into five places in heaven it's that quick because there's no time and having there's no clocks there's no calendars so there's no limit to what you can show me in those few seconds of taking that touching that and then putting it in my cart and so i've been many places sitting on the front row in the church waiting to speak he'd catch me up to heaven and show me somebody who had just arrived in heaven and want me to testify to that i could be walking somewhere and he would take me and i could even be visiting people and he would take me so sitting in a restaurant uh sometimes he actually comes in and sits next to me in the restaurant and i begin to shake and he'll begin to speak to me and then sometimes he'll take me now if he takes me my body remembers just gonna sit right there it i never know really i almost never get a warning he just comes and just takes me and i don't say i don't say no i say yeah he's i mean uh we going to heaven is it only limited to certain number of people or is it totally dependent on the relationship that you build with god i mean is it very selective is it very selective i mean it's a question it's just a question i mean we going to heaven is it like this is it like god is selective about people or it belongs to everyone you know based on the relationship that they build with the father oh are you talking about whether he takes you to heaven or not yes without dying is that what you're saying no no no what i'm saying is we going to heaven is it i mean yeah the only way you can go to heaven anyone who receives jesus christ as their savior repents of their sins and receives him as their savior that washes all your sin away that's what gives you entrance into heaven and anyone who does that no matter where they are in this world how old they are what their position is uh up until that moment until you receive christ you don't have the right to enter into heaven because you know we're born into sin but anyone who receives him no matter where they are yes they're they are going to go to heaven and that's the purpose of christ coming to deserve the bible says that god desires that none should perish that none should end up in hell but there will be people who refuse christ or just decide they don't want him and so it's very important to make sure that even young that people receive jesus christ i was four years old and i knew exactly what i was doing i knew i was receiving christ as my savior i'm sure i couldn't have committed many sins at that time but i still repented of them anyway and i actually i had this sounds up without i'm also a seer which means i see in the spirit realm the bible talks about the unseen realm and so that's why i'm able to see angels all the time or demons all the time and so when i received christ as my savior i actually saw him step inside of me it says in the bible that he indwells us you know that he he remains inside of us and i know he can be in people many people everywhere all at the same time but when you receive christ that's what gives you entrance into heaven and then after you receive christ you continue to pursue a relationship even when you're on the earth to spend time with christ even if you don't see him you need to say you're you're so blessed that he received you that he is your king that he is your savior and you can't wait to be with him in eternity and so no it's not for a special group it's not for a special even you know denomination everybody has now i will say this jesus christ you can you can pick any religion you want to but not all of them take you to heaven the one that says you must receive jesus christ as your savior in the bible john 3 16 that right there is what gives you entrance into heaven but it is available to anyone who wants to do that okay i'm talking about in this life like you you you are being caught up like john the revelator oh okay like johnny about people you know who is going to caught up to heaven or anybody who desires i'm sure the father has everything to do with who comes um it's his home right didn't jesus say in my father's house heaven is the father's home and i'm sure that i know that he catches many different people up and i tell people you can ask him and after you ask him thank him that you're going to get to go but i myself i never asked to be caught up to having shown anything i was born again for many many many years i was born again in 1956 and then in 1996 jesus came to me and said the father and he were going to start taking me to heaven for the purpose to reveal heaven to earth so they told me i would be going a lot all the time whenever they chose to take me whatever they showed they chose to tell me or show me that i was allowed to share on the earth so that's the commission it's a little bit different than just being you know it's not that i'm better than somebody it's just i have a it's like my my commission from god himself i have a photographic memory i'm like seventh generation christian which made me a lot more open to the father saying i need you to share this i'm going to show you this you know i'm delighted no matter where he takes me and if you stop taking me i'd still be happy i don't want to stay in heaven actually when they show me things i can't wait for them to bring me back so i can share so it's a little bit different i just know that as years go by he's taking more and more people just to give them a glimpse of what's up there and we all know paul saw heaven we know john the revelator saw heaven in the book of uh revelations and also in john so um there were people even in the bible that were caught up to heaven without dying it was for god's purpose we know ezekiel saw isaiah saw it i mean abraham saw parts of it and so many people even in the bible so that shouldn't be strange to people on the earth that god is able to do that i'm also sure the holy spirit catches people up and takes him up up to heaven because it says you know um it said that no one no eye has seen your ear heard nor entered in the heart or mind of man but god has prepared for us on the earth except it'd be revealed by the spirit of god and that could be the father that could be holy spirit or that could be jesus and any one of those could catch people up to heaven sometimes he'd catch several people up out of a meeting and then they'd come back and testify about it trust me you'll know if you went there people get so excited they can't stop talking about it but i'm not saying it's impossible for just anybody to go that's not true but if you were given a commission like different people in the bible had a commission like abraham had his commission moses had his he had to lead the people out into the promised land and even noah had a commission he had to build the ark and so it wasn't that necessary that that god loved him more this is it he knew in their heart they would live holy and he knew that they would say yes when he asked for something you have to be willing and obedient when god says i'm giving you and it might be to go feed the children in the world you know it might be to start a mission somewhere it might be to start a business somewhere that would help people with new ideas and things and that's what they're called to do it's like like i'm not a pastor and i'm not necessarily a teacher i'm not an evangelist but i am somebody who has a commission from god and besides being a prophet god shows me many things to come i am also a revelator and that means that i will reveal the things of god it could be from the future it could be in the past it could be right now on this earth what's going on but mainly reveal heaven to this earth and then to create things in the earth that would represent heaven that people could have if they could wear or hold or something to look at god wants this world he wants people to know that he is real his son is real holy spirit is real and that heaven is real and so that is a commission but i'm not saying it's impossible for others to go i've even known him to catch people up that weren't even born again yet they were so shocked when they got there they were so undone by by heaven when as soon as they got back they got born again thank you so much i have many questions but you are just answering you know all of the questions in one question you know what i'm asking that's how it happened that's this is how it happens what is grace and abundant grace can you differentiate and how do we apply that uh the grace and the abundant grace how do we apply it in our lives well there's actually this grace for eternal life we know the bible talks about that right by the grace of god we are saved it's not anything about how much money we have or how smart we are or or even how old we are it's the grace of god is what we get because his son was willing to die god makes that grace eternal life grace available to anybody who pursues it who who enters into that covenant with christ and so that's grace but there is another grace it's called abundant life grace and the father in the scripture says to come before my throne of this is the father speaking come before my throne of grace to find help and grace in time of need abundant life grace and jesus by the way was filled with that grace that grace the father's grace he gave it to his son so when his son came you know here jesus said i come to give what life and life more abundantly and he didn't have to ask for that grace it says in the bible the father filled his son with that grace abundant life grace when christ was a child i'm sure that was because abundant life grace is like fuel from heaven and you know normally we would ask for that grace like i ask every day father i ask for and receive grace for abundant life this day and when i say those words i feel literally it feels like like a light electricity coming over me and that is fueled from heaven for that day can you actually make us do that ma'am huh can you make us do that can you make us ask for grace can you teach us how to do that i mean when the when the father wanted me to understand something he actually had me do it myself so he called me up and he said put your hands out in front of you and so i did and he said i need you to say these words father father i ask for i ask for i want everyone to repeat who is watching live i ask for and receive grace and receive grace for abundant life for abundant life this day this day in jesus name in jesus name amen and you know right now i feel it i i really feel it coming into me i know everybody can't but but some people begin to when you begin to do this and the reason why you do it 24 every 24 hours a day it runs out and nobody can tell me it doesn't run out because if i forget to do that i don't always act maybe so nice i'm still a believer and jen and i are some of the best testimonies for this because jen loose me and listen with me and my husband so does my mom so all of us separately every day when we're saying our prayers in the morning we will say that prayer and if somebody doesn't say it and they come out of the room they don't act the same because you didn't get fuel from heaven yes now that abundant life grace is also available for any believer who asked and it will stop you from getting stressed out angry frustr frustrated especially stressed any of those things that that combat you all day long somebody people saying not nice things to you that that abundant life grace will either even cover that it likes it covers you from things penetrating you and so i would say it's definitely worth it it was one of the first things the father taught me he said when you come out of that room i don't want you and just your fleshly attitude even as a believer you know we can have opinions and we're not so nice sometimes to people i don't want that coming out with you so you will ask for this grace every day and i will fill you with abundant life grace every day and there's a total difference when i come out of that room rarely do i come out without it but everybody knows because i'm like why did somebody not do this why is that not done how come nobody took it why didn't anybody tell me this but if i if i'm filled with that grace and i come out of the room and go how are you today isn't this a beautiful day and it's like because i'm filled already with heaven for that whole day and you will find out that you respond differently to people that you stay excited and happy and we try to teach this to most of our staff because then that means our day is going to be really nice too as well as there so it's free and so you just have to ask for that yeah even i could make out the difference you know whenever i don't ask for grace so i keep asking every day and the day would be amazing and i want to give one example in the bible about where christ uh taught at somebody it was it was paul you remember when paul kept asking christ take the thorn of flesh away from me it keeps buffeting me i don't want it bothering me so paul was getting aggravated and frustrated and what did christ say to him my grace is sufficient for you for the day for the evil thereof and what christ was saying was this abundant life grace will cover that so that it doesn't affect you like that and you notice he said every day so trust me don't argue just ask for that abundant life graciously receive it and you will be ahead of the game when you get out there into this world is not so nice right so we need all that we can to make us a better christian amen amen true can you talk about spirit soul and body and the next question is what is soul cleansing and how do we do that okay first you can talk about spirit soul and body and then you can tell us about the soul cleansing okay we are made in three parts and isn't that amazing okay there's father son and holy spirit and we we are made in we're a three-part being we are body that's our physical body our soul was actually the very core of our being and we are spirit we are made in all three and there's a reason why he made us that way your soul is actually like the core of your being it would be like your engine if you were a car whatever you put in the engine of that vehicle determines how well it runs well that is the same way with your soul your soul is your mind so even your soul has three parts isn't that wild so body soul and then spirit your spirit man and then in your soul itself it is your mind what you think about your will what you choose and your emotions that's what you're going to how you're going to display your feelings uh the things you say how you treat people how you respond and two things it will affect everything that soul will it's very important to understand that the bible says that we are living souls that's how important it is to understand that you all you have that soul part of you is very important it's not something you ignore yes it gets saved it gets bored again but there's so much more to it than that and so the body you have to have the body to live in the earth but there's a reason why you need that body because spirits cannot rule in this earth they will try to take authority or they'll try to you know they'll try to step kill steal and destroy i'm talking about the demonic spirits angels are present here to help us all the time uh and so the spirits are here to help if they're gods and to do bad things against you if they belong to the devil but you have to have flesh do you have authority in the earth and god said let us make man in our image and after the way we operate and even jesus when he came he had to have flesh put on him why so he could have authority to speak spiritually against the darkness or to heal people so even christ had to have that flesh in order to have authority in the earth also to die on the cross so he had to have that flesh the flesh is very important it's like your suit i tell people it's your earth suit and so you need that to be in the earth to live in this atmosphere god made a whole physical realm and put this world and the other worlds in the physical realm um because heaven itself is a spiritual world where you will go and live in your spirit and one day when the dead in christ were raised that was your body that remained behind when you went to heaven it died and went in the ground there'll be a day when all our bodies are resurrected and god takes their spirit man and puts it back in that body and it will be together forever he won't ever separate us again and then he will glorify that body uh for eternity and to be immortal which means you can never die so but you have to have this body to have authority in the earth that's why the devil tries to use people to get them to do wicked things satan can't just do everything himself and take over he'd like to even right now he can't totally do that but see he has to have a flesh that he can impress and he can deceive satan so you can abuse it but god needs us we're his witnesses in the earth we were sent from heaven to earth to be a witness and a testimony to him that he is real that he loves he loves everybody here and god doesn't like violence at all and the enemy uses the violence you know you know the bible says satan comes to kill steal and destroy and he only can do that if you give him permission or you don't know you have authority with jesus christ and there's a lot more to all of this that i could say but i didn't want to explain so you are made in three parts your soul which is at the very core of your being sometimes the bible calls it the heart the word heart doesn't mean this physical beating heart it means the very core of you the heart of something is the center of something and that is your soul so what you watch with your eyes or what you hear with your ears will go in that soul and it's so important to make sure you don't you don't let evil things go in and you don't let evil words come out of your mouth whatever is edifying your people whichever gives them hope and life god says to speak life and to choose life and so what you do every day not just once but what you do every day in the decisions you make every day either makes you once you're born again it either makes you a better christian or a weaker christian so make sure that what you're filling your soul with is what god would want you to put there okay things that bring life joy celebration his word his presence god's plans that's what needs to be in our soul and by the way the more you put of him in your soul the light that comes from you if you could see the light come everybody has light coming from them it comes out of your spirit so the more of god you have by reading his word by listening to him by obeying him that light gets brighter and brighter so you can see we're all specially made so that explains that now i want to explain what do you do if you get stuff inside of you you shouldn't have seen it maybe you watched a really horrid terror horror movie or something you should never do that because then that opens up attacks from the enemy i don't allow anything like that to be in me and so or maybe you had a trauma when you were younger or even now where you were hurt or abused yourself that puts trauma in your soul which will affect you you don't want to keep that in there uh maybe you said maybe you got a fight with somebody and just slashed them you know with your words and trash and maybe you even said profanity which by the way the only one who speaks profanity is hell i always tell people profanity is hell's language you don't ever want to say that you don't ever want to be mean or get offended with people these this mouth was meant to help if you belong to christ and so if you get filled with all this junk you can imagine if you didn't know christ and maybe for the first 30 40 years you just lived in the world and you acted like the world you have a lot of stuff to get out of here and god made a way for that to happen it's actually called the keys to the kingdom which you lose you choose with your will as a believer to lose anything out of your soul maybe you went and watched the movie about witchcraft that's not a wise thing don't read books about witchcraft don't keep any anything that are emblems or things that would be used in in anything with witchcraft and rituals or anything get rid of all that stuff i mean get the stuff out of your house and get rid of it but this house is the most important thing to keep things out of okay maybe you got offended at somebody you wouldn't speak to them for ten years you were so angry with them that shouldn't be in you if you're a believer the anger shouldn't be there uh if you got addicted to even stuff addicted to drugs or addicted to other things that addiction gets a hold in your soul it does it gets in your soul and you need to get all of those things out of you why so you can be a testimony to jesus christ so you can live free of fear of hate offense unforgiveness any addictions you know especially fear because satan ridley right now is trying to use fear but you don't have to carry any of that god made your soul that it could be free and why do i say that because of the scripture god desires above everything else that you prosper and live in health how about that well how does that happen then it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and then you will be in hell so if your soul is filled with all of this stuff from the world or or whatever else you've taken in you your soul can't prosper why it's got junk in it and so according to that scripture you have to get that stuff out of your soul so you can then be free and it says it's what it says as your soul prospers as you keep that stuff out and put god in you you should begin to prosper financially uh emotionally relationally with other people you should increase in every way and you shouldn't have sickness in you how about that a lot of the reasons people are sick is what is in their soul maybe it wasn't their fault maybe they lived in a family where there was a lot of abuse and stuff like that you can lose all the abuse you experienced any trauma you have had even if it was years ago you can get that out of your soul if you've gotten angry and said hateful things you can cancel those words get those words out of your soul what you say to other people guess what goes in their soul but it also goes in yours so when you are mean or hateful to people or angry or raging you're not just hurting those people with your words you're actually affecting your own soul and i know the father spent quite a bit of time uh teaching me all this with the the reason for that is so we can be free and i know some people you go to counseling for maybe eight months even a year to get this stuff out of your soul i'm not saying you might not need some help or counseling along the way but you literally can get most all of it out of your soul by you choosing to do that what you loose on earth they will loosen heaven in other words let's say i had a huge trauma maybe i saw somebody murder that would be a bad thing or i was abused i was never abused as a child but i know people have been beat up with words their whole life until they can't think for themselves maybe they don't want to know people or speak to people uh if i wanted to get that that that out of my soul if i want to get abuse out of myself i would say i choose i'll explain first and we'll do it as a matter of fact can you make us can you make us do that as a matter of fact can you make us do this yeah yeah yeah i always want people to know what you were doing okay uh i could just have people repeat it but i want you to know what happens when you do this yeah so let's say i had a bad experience when i was growing up and i experienced something that was horrible and i that i keep seeing it over and over satan will play over and over anything bad that you saw or experience he'll make sure because you know what it's in it's in your soul so he'll play it over and over again like a movie and you're tired of that so this one woman i knew i'd just use her an example she was abused by her husband many times and she grew up still having nightmares years later they were no longer together she had nightmares but her children had nightmares because they were present when he abused her this is what satan wants to ruin everybody's life she heard about me and so i went to speak somewhere and she came and she said can you help me i had just learned about um the keys to the kingdom it's called uh it's called a soul checkup and i said i can help you and in five minutes she said i can't get rid of these nightmares and should i stay filled with fear even though i'm i'm married to somebody who's wonderful now and we can talk about marriage later if you want to but right now she was still having that and so i led her in a pr under prayer where she loosed all of that stuff from her soul uh that it wouldn't remain and no longer be there in jesus name and when she loosed those experiences it was gone you know why because when she loosed it jesus came down and pulled it out of her in the bible it says jesus is the restorer of our soul yeah it does that so jesus literally comes and he'll pull all that stuff out of your soul so it's gone like it never happened and that can include any of those things i just mentioned and so when he did that he came and pulled that out of her she began to laugh i mean in my car she was laughing it was like three minutes she said it's gone i'm so filled with life i'm so happy right now and when i had gone to speak there actually her husband was the pastor he went in the store to get a few things and the time it took him to go in there and get those few things his wife was changed when he came back out because she was no longer sad or oppressed and then i had her bind bind the things of god to her soul so the keys of the kingdom what you lose on earth will be loosed in heaven what you bind on earth will be bound in heaven bound like to you so then i had a loot of blind bug the life of god the love of god the presence of god she chose to bind them to her soul and after that then she was really filled with joy so i'm going to lead everybody to do that i want you to understand you must be born again you must have jesus christ in you to do this because he makes it available for us right this is something he offers us so that our soul guess what can prosper so we're going to do this together so we have to start all my friends i want you all to do this yeah i choose i choose as a child of god as a child of god in a believer in jesus christ and a believer in jesus christ to lose from my soul to lose from my soul all fear all fear all anger all anger all addictions all addictions all trauma all trauma all profanity all profanity i lose all violence i lose all violence whether i saw it whether i've seen it or i experienced it or i experienced it i lose it i lose them for myself i lose from my soul i lose from my soul a harsh all harsh hateful hateful judgmental judgmental critical words critical words that were spoken to me that were spoken to me i lose from my soul i lose them from my soul and i lose from my soul and i lose from my soul all witchcraft all witchcraft whether it was in my family whether it was in my family or i practiced it myself but i practiced it myself or i read about it or i read about it i watched witchcraft in movies or i watched witchcraft in movies i loose it all from my soul i lose it all from my soul i lose from my soul i lose from my soul all control all control from satan from satan from things in the past from things in the past that i was a part of that i was a part of i no longer i no longer want any of those things in my soul part of me i no longer want those things to be in my soul i no longer want those things in my soul i lose from my soul i lose from my soul all oppression all oppression or depression all depression all suicidal thoughts all suicidal thoughts i loose them from my soul in jesus name i lose them from my soul in jesus name i thank you father i thank you father that your son that your son is the restorer of my soul is the restorer of my soul i lose from my soul i roost from my soul all pornography all pornography all in any sexual sin or any sexual sin whether i watched it whether i watched it or looked at it or looked at it i was involved in it but i was involved in it i loose it from my soul i lose it from my soul i thank you in jesus name i thank you in jesus name that it is gone that it is gone like it was never there like i was never dead and now we're going to bind the things of god to our soul amen i choose i choose as an act of my will as an act of my will and a believer in jesus christ and a believer in jesus christ the bind to my soul to bind to my soul god's love god's love god's presence god's presence the joy of the lord the joy of the lord god's plans for my life god's plans for my life his excitement is excitement his expectation for my life his expectation for my life his celebration over me his celebration over me i bind his will i bind his will his way his way to my soul to my soul that no one can take it from me that no one can take it from me i thank you jesus i thank you jesus for loving me for loving me amen amen thank you so much well i have many questions i don't know uh at what time i need to close but if your time is up just let me know so that i can just stop questioning you and you can talk about the plans that god has over this planet so i have a few more minutes but you know we can do this again yes sure sure sure can you tell me how many minutes is it about 10 minutes my staff will all be here oh okay okay so i will ask you some important questions so that i don't miss out and it would be really helpful to all the uh believers over here in india uh what is the role of uh guardian angels and the next question is what does the manifested son and daughter of god mean okay the role of your of the guardian angel um that angels usually have more than one almost everybody has two um angels at the time you are conceived before you are born your angels are sent from heaven them so that they can watch over you they keep you they help to keep you out of trouble many times they will save your life and you won't even know they saved your life so their number one uh reason that they're here that god sends them it says to guard you and keep you in all your ways now when we get old enough we can make decisions that might go against what they want to do right we all have a will to choose things ourselves but if you are serving god and and you're going on his path those angels will be with you everywhere they literally go with you everywhere okay they're waiting for you when you wake up and uh they go with you all day long many places and i know things still happen to people sometimes but the majority of people their lives are kept from death from being injured or from being harmed because of your guardian angel the other assignment for your guardian angel is when you die they are the ones who actually take you to heaven and so they'll be with you from the day you're born they'll stay with you to the day you die and then they will take you to heaven and so that is the main purpose for your guardian angels yeah and the manifested sons and daughters and the armies of heaven what is their role how do we make use of the host of the heavens the role of the manifested sons and daughters are believers i mean you can't manifest who god is if you're not a believer right you have to receive christ those who have a passion to do things for god uh those who are willing to be obedient i know god asks many people to do many different things and some say yes some say later some say i don't think so it doesn't mean you won't go to heaven it's just me if you surrender to him like it says in the bible to lay down your life and find it in christ that means you let christ guide you personally and he then can have you give words to people or take things to people or even to step out and boldly speak at different times whatever it is he asked you to do the more you are willing the more he can trust you with but in in the book of romans where it talks about the earth itself this earth is groaning for us to stand up and take authority over the darkness even over the earth and and do things that christ tells us in that moment to do things and i mean those are powerful things they're signs and wonders of the supernatural that most people couldn't ever do themselves because it's christ in you remember christ in you the hope of glory you'll do powerful things like at one point people will stop a hurricane just stop it let christ stop the storm uh they'll stop earthquakes they will uh they'll not just walk on water other people will do more things than that but we also know that christ said the things i did you will do also that means the miracles christ did in the bible he expects us to step up and begin to do these things but if you don't just say i'm making myself available jesus if there's something you need me to do i'm willing and then when he asks you to do it you actually do it and to the point where you go um there's more kings and priests to our god those are levels of authority and dominion now when you're born again you're going to go to heaven but if you're going to rule an authority in this earth in the spirit realm like pushing back to darkness uh calling those things that be not as though they were like one day people will speak and there'll be water uh all kinds of miracles you'll speak and the food will be multiplied all those things begin to happen you are then demonstrating the power of the living god not so you look good so people will know he exists so that's what a manifested son or daughter these these are my sisters tell me i've got to hurry so i got hurt anyway so these are great signs and wonders that will be beginning to happen in the earth a lot of them have not happened yet but we're entering into those days where people you won't have to ask somebody they'll know because these things will be taped and sent all over the world like like i said you'll stop an earthquake it'll stop and you make it put it back the way it was before it came that is what a manifested son or daughter would do but if you don't step out and say i'll go pray for that person god says go pray for that person who has a broken leg if you don't step out and say i'll go in jesus name i command your leg to be healed and then trust god to do it you have to step up with the small things and you also have to understand this is available as believers this is part of our calling to be able to do those things but you must seek after them by seeking after jesus christ first yes uh i just have another two questions you can just keep them short this is the question that most of the believers uh you know this is a doubt that they have in their hearts why some christians or believers die early and uh i mean i i even my sister was promoted to glory at a very young age like around 23 years old and i was in depression for quite a few years then after listening to your uh to the revelations that god brought forth through you then i understood she is in the right place and i even had a vision you know where i happened to see her in the heaven so can you just answer this yeah oh i've got to hurry really quick okay so i can't explain why some people go early and why some don't go early i do know this sometimes god has a position in heaven like he would put you over the youth or he'd put you over projects in heaven or even move of god come to the earth he'll have let you have some responsibility and preparing that stuff in heaven for that that's a reward that's not a job and so because that time comes for that to begin to happen he will then call those people home to heaven and so that's his decision they made their self available to him it's not to make you upset or to hurt somebody it's just that when we give ourselves to christ does that mean we really give ourselves to him or do we just want to keep ourselves for ourselves i i do know that there's things many times that's why or for whatever reason he has your mansion done at a certain time in heaven so you can be part of something that is going on in heaven that's about the best way i can explain it he never does it to hurt somebody he's not trying to make us sad but when if you've had someone that has lost you need to say i choose to release my family number into the joy of the lord and to their reward in heaven and i lose all that grief from my soul because if they're with him how can that be a sad thing as a believer you'll be together through all eternity and i tell people don't spend all your time just you know dying and dying and grieving when they're in heaven enjoying their life being with the lord getting to see wonderful things maybe he's given them a reward to do something in heaven they don't want you to grieve on the earth okay our our lives are sealed in christ amen and if you need you can say jesus come and bring me peace i receive your peace and then he will pour peace over you but i'm sure that we'll have to do this another time because i know how hungry people are and i want you to know that god wants you to have understanding about him about his son about holy spirit and where you will live one day this earth is such a short time for us and yet how an awesome opportunity we have to love people for christ to do things for him it's it's an honor and an opportunity to get to share with you and father just to bless those people who are watching god i ask holy spirit to go to them and to minister to them to draw even more to christ i thank you for using these words to bring hope and joy and even celebration to your children you need a father you love them you made them you made them for you i pray they know the truth that they are free and that they don't miss their destiny on this earth and that we will all be together in heaven and in eternity forever we can fellowship and get to know one another so don't let fear control you don't let the enemy control you when you love people it's like bashing the enemies so when you have a choice to love or not love please choose love and i will see you later can you talk about the websites how people can reach you your your stores and all that the websites yes my website i have one called revealingheaven.com yeah and you can get some products and find out about where i'll be speaking or you can go to catker.com that's k-a-t k-e-r-r dot com and see all kinds of free videos i'm also on

hallelujah good morning everybody this is almost my morning how many people don't know me or know anything about me anybody got dragged here i'm so glad you're here i prayed for you a long time ago that people would understand heaven is different they live differently there uh hair color is heaven culture i didn't ask for this i am not a pink care person well i am now but years ago when the lord came to me in person because even as a child i would say if jesus never comes to me in person and asks me to do something there's no way i'm not saying yes this is like an eight-year-old okay so i was strange even batman i've been a seer my whole life i was born with that gift that does not belong to the enemy most people when you mention mention the seer or the spirit realm they think you're part of the new age movement no it was around long before the new age movement was here okay it belongs to god is sent from heaven he needs seers on this earth and he needs prophets that are seers more than anything else because we say what we see whatever he takes us and shows us the difference between a prophet and the seed of prophet is we actually get to see what he's saying not just here and say it therefore we give details and i can assure you what i say to you today will be things he told me or showed me or both and maybe things you never heard of before or even thought of before but i speak on behalf of heaven on this earth that is my commission it's not my gift my gift my passion is photography so you see before you a photographer minding her own business which is now god's business remember when jesus said i must be about the father's business remember when he said that i understand what he meant when he said that okay because he had the life of a carpenter correct say amen he was sent is a carpenter corrupt right he was then as a businessman and he knew who he was long before he got to that place of being a businessman god loves business people because they have openings that a lot of people who are in you know if they're christian leaders or in any way associated with a christian i don't like to say religious because god's not religious he wants a relationship with you and even that is sometimes new to people that never heard that man man created religion christ created a relationship he died for every single person right on the planet he didn't die just for a denomination and saying that i was part of the assemblies of god almost all of my entire life and grew up in that atmosphere which was awesome we had holy spirit we had the gifts working we had miracles we sent missionaries all over the world i helped to serve at our family church not my dad's church but it was our family's church i'm from a family of 15 children i'm number three that means i died a long time ago i also can read your thoughts just a tip i belong to jesus christ since i was four years old that was well over 60 years ago i forget how old i am because i don't look at age god counts time by events and so he chose me for a certain time on this earth to do things and say things for him i never asked to be caught up to heaven he decided that i was going to be a photographer i was going to work in business i loved working with ceos for over 25 years i was working in business he took me out of that at one point in my life and he said i'm going to prepare you for what is coming and the next season of your life he didn't say it would be to be caught up to have it non-stop to give revelation on what heaven is like i would have done it anyway because by that time i was besotted with him i saw him earnestly on purpose fiercely for over 20 years now remember i was born again at four this is when i'm into my 20s by this point in my life and in my 30s i really passionately and i've raised three children i'm married there's my husband a 43 year sit right there y'all pray for him okay he has to live with me i'm not normal you can't be normal when you've been to heaven as many times as i have been there this is not really reality to me standing here this is a vapor in time your life right now is a vapor in time your future is going to be so powerful and great and grand and i'm not just talking about when you get to heaven i'm talking about because of the time you live in right now one of the most amazing fascinating powerful times to be alive on the earth is actually right now and anytime god before he did something great the enemy showed up to try to steal that time the enemy wants his time his time is not yet and the father would tell me all the time he's only given satan a bump in the road that's what he calls the tribulation in the paris times and there's people now even saying they're not going to have that they're wrong [Music] i've seen god's timeline part of it and he is going to have those things happen for his own purposes he needs them to happen in the earth they'll be for a short time but the times we're entering into now will be for generations maybe you didn't think that again i've seen 50 to 100 years into the future and the mere perilous times had not happened the tribulation had not happened and i think it would be better if we stop saying he's going to come tomorrow i will say he's going to come when the father tells him to is the correct thing to say christ is coming back i absolutely believe in the rapture i absolutely believe that those times will happen but those aren't these times we haven't even done the works alone the greater works christ passionately said certain things would happen and some of them haven't even happened he's not willing to wrap it up and end it in the midst of darkness amen amen things are getting greater and greater and more and more powerful in these days we literally will learn to rule like christ did in the earth the bible clearly says don't tell me what the word says i know what it says people better know what it says it says we will rule and reign with christ now say now and in the time to come we will that's who we are we have authority as believers if you're not a member of the body of christ you have no authority you have no authority over satan you have no authority in the spirit realm you have no authority to speak for god if you're not belong to jesus christ and you have not had your sins washed away you are not righteous i hope you say amen god does not agree with it's okay to sin all the time whenever you feel like it god does not agree with once you get saved and if you if you sin and keep on sinning the grace will cover it that's only if you repent that's what the word says is is righteous and just if you repent of your sins he will cleanse you from all unrighteousness is that what that says that means when you sin say you're not saved when you sin something happens in your soul when i have you say it that's why i do that when you sin that makes you unrighteous when you repent you wipes it away i love the truth i live by the truth i have to myself it doesn't matter that he catches me up to heaven all the time shows me mysteries takes me into the past takes me into the future i know what his heart is i know what his words are i know what his ways are i walk in them i know his will is not always what ours is the best way you can live is his will his way not his will your way he he desires so much for us to attain to everything that christ won for us this is one of those times where we're going to arise above our lives and all the way we've been living in the past that doesn't mean he won't desire holiness in our life that means we'd be doing things we never dreamed we would be doing and therefore when he's going to do something like that he has to clean the platform off the platform of mania that platform of the enemy and crush the enemy and push him back so that we will have freedom to move around this earth not just in this country which by the way will be absolutely not just restored but almost is not a reborn for america to go down the tube and end we are this is what the father says you are a baby country you're still a baby you have begun to walk in all that i desire and i created you to do in this earth you are and will be a great light to this world a place where people can come to know my son a place where they can walk in the glory that is created by those who love me a place where people come to see the miraculous as a normal way of life a place will come to america not to find the american dream but define me [Music] a place where prosperity will happen because two-thirds of the gospel has been paid for by people from this country i am not going to ignore the cries nor the prayers of my people they are precious to me they allow me to give my permission to move and operate on their behalf and even over those who would take steal and try cheat and steal and take this country away if you're interested the father calls biden a villain you should say amen a villain in any movie is the worst people who promotes and carries out evil deeds and the father is well aware of everything that's going on behind the barbed wire and he's not going to tolerate it because of the importance of these days for god for his son for holy spirit in this earth and especially particularly a miracle because it helps others know and learn about jesus christ and let me tell you that is not going to stop happening they have carried the message of the gospel of the kingdom they will now begin to carry the knowledge and the power of the glory he's not going to give up his time for the glory to be seen and known in this world there's actually scriptures written about the glory of god the number one is christ in you is the hope of glory do you know what that means that means you will begin to create glory for god and you will carry that glory literally the light of god will come from you that scripture also means that you will release that glory and operate in that glory how do you think the knowledge of it is going to go around this world we will demonstrate it things beyond your imagination are the days we're stepping into because of that god won't even send new creations and inventions to this earth because he's not willing for the wicked you have them say amen see he's well aware of everything that's going on he's not oblivious to it it's not that he doesn't care he does care he just has a plan amen and it may not line up with man's dates that they keep trying to give that he's going to do something they were all wrong or he would have done it he won't even give me a date he'll say i'm going to do this and i'll say god's going to do this it doesn't bother me that it doesn't happen for a year or several months or even weeks i waited 45 years before for him to do something he promised me and i never gave up and he did it amen my family understands faith we lived by faith god was welcome in our home so his holy spirit so was jesus christ he was our healer you got 15 kids you need jesus as your healer from being shot point blank with a shotgun to being bit by deadly spiders from being hunted by people kidnapped and then brought back we stood in faith for all things and every one of them we had victory why can i not stand for a few months to see god act in my country and in my nation this is not just about america this is about the whole world right now he is exposing evil all over the world in great detail and most people will be shocked and i promise you you will know what was going on you actually see the evidence the hear the hear the testimonies see the videos of the horrific things that have been already got they already have the evidence right now this moment i'm standing here they have the evidence and i will promise you this trump is our president if you don't want that you need to lose something out of your soul because you're fighting against god not trump that's right god picked somebody who couldn't be bought who couldn't be forced who couldn't have fear put in them who could not be controlled he picked him on purpose and he picked a businessman he has already proven himself that he loves this country and he loves the people in this country and there's absolutely you should know by now persecution comes because the enemy doesn't like certain things the persecution is the proof that you're going to get what you ask for you have properties and lands and blessings in this life with what say persecution you should always rejoice when persecution comes that means you're doing exactly what god wants it's really evidence i rejoice i call pastor and say man you should be rejoicing and dancing you've got all that persecution you're going to get something great from god amen and he never saw it that way i said that's how jesus thinks he wasn't concerned at all about persecution he didn't care that the religious higher if he didn't like him he was a threat to them he was also a character when he walked in this earth he was funny people loved to be with him even sinners i'm sure he captivated them in revelation they never expected to hear they heard words they never heard before and it made them burn inside people burn in heaven because of the revelation they live in in the parts of god they see you never got to see they get to see parts of the future they get to see parts of the new earth they saw how things were done by god way in the past before even the physical realm was created your family members are living in the greatest place possible they are happy they're rejoicing they're blessed beyond measure they have mansions no human hands can afford to build your mama and your dad your grandparents great grandparents don't want to come back not because they don't love you but they're one of the one who loves them the most if you can have the understanding of that love it makes it a lot easier to live in this world when you see it through christ's eyes when he was on that cross dying for all of us and he understood that people didn't understand they didn't have a clue the ones who were even reviling against him at that point he died anyway didn't he what little is it to us to die to our flesh sometimes if we have a choice to be kind to someone even if they're being mean to us it's one of the greatest things you can do to pierce the enemy you pierce the heart of the enemy when you love instead of fighting back against people when you're kind even when you are spent is fat upon or mistreated or wrongfully accused when you choose to love doesn't mean you're just being foolish it means you're piercing the enemy your worship also pierces the enemy it goes right through the second heaven maybe you didn't know about that satan has built his own little tiny kingdom up there he sits under throwing skulls and he rules from up there because he's a prince in power in the air so he can do things in the spirit realm the spirit realm is both both sides are there all the time uh this is not heaven all right you're not living in heaven right now we're having more heaven sent down than ever before that heaven is not reserved and neither is hell heaven is beyond your imagination with the glory with the beauty the splendor the creativity the wonder of being there in his presence all the time with him you ride on your worship across the skies of heaven into the throne room you're transported through beams of light from one side of heaven to the other the food is everywhere there's no weight gain or food allergies on heaven everyone is young there is no age there is no time there's amazing fun exciting things to do because the father is a father and it says you must be like a little child because when you get there you're going to be shocked to see how many fun things he made for you you may be 90 now but you feel like you're 9 when you get there there's laughter everywhere in heaven people love it it is love because he's there and he chose this time not us many people are in fear they shouldn't be if they belong to him he actually said i have not given you a spirit of fear but of power say power i want you to notice that's the number one thing he says has given us he gives us power that power he gives us as a believer is over all the power of the enemy that means no matter what's going on around us we have authority to speak against that you have authority to speak against anything the enemy is doing to you because jesus gave us that every demon should run in fear when you get up in the morning hell should tremble when you open your mouth and speak things to people because you have authority in your mouth you have the word of god you have the power of god you have the life of god you get revelation you have you have his plans his will for your life he chose you and put you on the earth that's why you're here right now no matter who you were birthed out of you were birthed from him first and he went down his timeline and chose when you would be here because he needs you here so these days are going to be different than anything we've ever lived before i've already seen these days i've seen well into the next 50 years that should be normal so i have no fear of anything he holds my life in his hand and the father holds the breath of every being on this earth and there are something so wicked he said all i have to do is remove it and they're out there are some very wicked people in this world right now they may not live through this yes god has done that before in the past he wiped everybody off the earth it was so wicked as bad as it is right now it is not as bad as it was the tase of noah i know people think it is but it's not it's i'm not gonna talk about those horrific things that they did back then but there are people wicked enough to want that to happen and the thing is when the enemy finds enough and he's actually found a lot of humans who are willing to do things his way but the enemy's already lost because this is not his time even when it is his time he's not going to get what he wants because even those who are believers at the time of the tribulation and the parasites will be some of the strongest believers that ever walked on this earth they won't even be afraid to die i know i've seen the movies from the time i was young i've seen the movies about you know during those days how bad it will be uh nobody will be forced to take the mark the mark is not the michael chip you can't see it that mark satan is going to put on people will be seen three blocks away because he's full of himself and he wants people to know who gave themselves to him so that won't be something that is forced on anybody he wants people to willingly do that and right now he's found a lot of willing people but it's still not the time for him to have authority in this earth therefore god is going to take and wipe the platform clean not just in america but he will remove evil from many different places and high authority leadership in many different countries around this world i know everybody said well we're going to have the harvest it still won't be the final harvest the first waves of harvest we get those people need to be mentored to walk in the supernatural and learn how to roll with jesus christ so we don't know how to do that how are we going to mentor them we can't be normal we cannot be normal you can't live your life every day like it's the same you live your life with passion and excitement that we've been given great authority actually he gave us the earth amen we are stewards of this earth we're stewards of what goes on around here and god said i will allow what you allow i will not allow what you don't allow that's also on the bible so why are we allowing things everything you say from your mouth is written down should go back and read the scripts i started counting my words a long time ago because i see scribe angels writing things down about ten years ago i woke up and there were two things sitting on the end of my bed and then one scribe angel looked at me said we have been sent for the words of all the leaders in the body of christ at this point on where you'll write down everything they say whether in public or in private and from those words or speaking god will decide who will have a leadership in these great end days and who will not have leadership those who will operate in power and authority those who will not allow to operate in power and authority if there's sin in their lives they will not be allowed to operate not in these greater days of glory he said people can fake many things they can fake being the five-fold ministry they can fake by things they say and yet they are sinning behind the scenes but god sees everything that's right he's not watching you to hit you over the head with something he's watching you to see what is in your heart what do you desire to do for others that thing to esteem others more highly than yourself goes a long way in heaven i was raised that way my dad was raised that way i'm from seven generations of believers who actually believed i was the one who didn't want to be known or seen by anybody i was not someone who would put pink in my hair i was the quiet one watch out for the quiet ones they're thinking and they're watching all the time i can just tell you god had a plan for my life i had a little plan i was going to get me a nice apartment and be in some big company because i loved working in business i'd like to see things happen and god had another plan no i'm going to give you pink hair i'm going to take you up to have a non-stop and you're going to go over the world and speak to everybody gonna hug them and let them kiss you on the cheek if they want to i was not a person that wanted to be hugged or kissed by anybody and yet i've been kissed thousands of times by people around the world you know bring each other with a brotherly kiss that kind of a kiss so he's changed me he's changed the way i think the way i look at people i look at him through his eyes he loves you more than you ever ever can imagine no matter who you are even what you've done even with your failures with your mistakes things that you gave up on he has not given up on you and he has not given up on this country amen he has repeatedly told me america is not evil it isn't america itself is not it's one nation under god and he says that to me all the time it's my country it's mine and he said in 2015 i put my hand on the country and i turned that map red and he had already declared that trump would be president for eight years knowing every single thing that would happen and god says oh no he means right now not talking about in 2024 he's talking about right now he said to me trump won the election he didn't lose that makes him president the other side lied and cheated that disqualifies them they said if in the olympics they are caught cheating they are not congratulated they are not honored they are not rewarded they are removed and they have absolute all the proof they need that that happened just because the civil courts wouldn't hear the cases doesn't mean justice is not coming amen and i can promise you trump knows all this he's not been lazy he's been very busy behind the scenes so are many other smart smart and intel smart people around the world that no one is right and what is not right and they don't need any more evidence than they have to take all of them to prison or be shot for treason these i'm speaking truth not making it up this is true trump is still our president he won the election uh on the election date and when they said we're going to stop the counting the holy spirit who is right beside me said that's really going to cheat and steal and change all the votes he said that to me right when they said those words we're going to stop the voting we'll pick it up tomorrow and then we'll see what happens well by that time almost 80 million people had already voted for trump and if you will notice you never saw biden's people he never had rallies because he had no people but they didn't know what they were going to do they knew from the beginning they would cheat they already had their plans laid out that all those the voting machines and the dominion system already working on their behalf and i know most of you weren't aware of that but they switched so many votes overnight that were for trump and switched them to biden and finally there's one county that has given permission to recount have 2.1 million of the ballots looked at individually all over again to make sure that they were counting but that's still not how he's going to be put back in office there's already things that have happened even in our military i will tell you this that the ones who are sitting there illegitimately god says they're illegitimate in dc he says the ones behind barbed wire that's how he talks about him [Music] are still hoping we will give up and let them do what they want to and this is what the father says there was a couple things they never considered when they plotted this whole thing together with the intel you know with the wicked rich with the fake news media i mean there's so many that are going to be probably be either put in prison lose what they have built up lose their fortunes because they will have been busted they're going to lose they'll lose all the way around there's no way they will ever win anything or have anything this is from the father himself he said number one they're trying to do this in a country that already is free they're not going to a third world country that isn't free they're trying to take things away from americans they're different they were born free they live free they make up their own mind uh they want a future he said they'll never be civil war that's what they were hoping for then we would be killing each other he said but americans true americans the red-blooded americans have a hope for a dream and a future they have a family they want a life and they want to live and they are not willing to give it up they didn't vote for evil they didn't choose evil he said an evil is not in power right now he will remind you of a scripture and the righteous are in power that people rejoice is that what it says well trump is in power the other side is not they're illegitimate they stole the election he knows it almost 80 million people know that it was stolen because everybody knows who they voted for amen so this is an epic time in our country to show when truth prevails and the people prevail this country belongs to god and we the people amen the other thing they were never god made considered he wanted us free for a reason it was for him and god says all the time i'm in your papers i'm on your money i'm written in your in your constitution you said i'm everywhere because i was allowed to be in this country he said when you look at the two differences between the illegitimate ones and the actual president i am welcome in this country by trump he even made that statement many times he recognizes who god is he invites god to be here he he loves christians he loves their faith he loves the the churches he loves and he wants us to have freedom and according to our constitution we have every right to have church to come together to meet is that correct so when the other side wants to wipe it out disallow it abolish it and crush it that should show you right there they're lost they have already lost what they want to plot and plan i'm not willing for that to happen amen and with all the prayers that have come forth on behalf of this country you need to know that when you pray they fill these bowls before the altar of god your prayers your worship fill these huge bowls and when they're full god tips them when they're tipped a whole new move of god comes to this earth so what is about to happen is it crash and burn to be destroyed it is about to be wiped clean of the evil and a powerful move of god is about to hit this country [Applause] and this is what the one who made everything is saying amen his words count above the others right amen but jesus christ wants is he not is not the earth he is and the bonus thereof the earth is who the lord and the fullness thereof then if it is his and he's already got this time planned who do you think is going to win it doesn't matter how bad it looks or sounds and i would encourage everybody to stop watching the fake news because they plotted and planned to brainwash people all along they understand how that works and they have done that to many people i have family members i have friends that listen to it and all they know is this they hate trump they can't even tell you why they hate him they just know they hate him right and so they're brainwashed into thinking he's so bad they gotta vote for the other side they don't even know what the other side stands for i know i met somebody the other day before i came oh i like who's in there now i said you like evil you want terrorists to come into our country without any boundaries you want human trafficking and drugs to keep rushing into our country without anyone stopping them you want law and order taken away so people can come and burn your place or take whatever they want to from you and they're looking at me really strange well that's not what's going to happen i said they've already signed papers are you not listening to what they're saying oh no i just know they're good and trump is mad and that's what some people think they don't have a clue because they were taught for all those years continually when the same thing is put into you over and over again in your soul and you don't stop it or you don't lose it from there it builds in you as a man thinketh in his heart that's your soul so is he that means what you let in is what you will become your heart he talks about the bible all the time isn't this human beating heart it's the core the word heart means the core of something the center of something the core of your being is your soul you are a soul that's what god said when he made adam he became a living soul that is very key the other thing the body of christ needs to learn is what does that mean why is my soul so important why do you think he says to guard it you decide what goes in there you decide what you watch what you hear and what you say and all three of those things will affect who you are that's what will come out of you what you allow in there if you don't like you maybe you should change what you're saying or what you're watching because it will influence your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choose and your emotions how you respond to all that what do you act out in your life what do you actually say about you are you manifesting from christ his character his purposes his words clearly written because that's what he wants from us the world should look at us and see christ when they hear us they should hear christ is that right is christian being christ's life then we need to start acting like this because when you do you terrify the devil if he can't crush you and put fear in you which has always been his greatest weapon his second greatest weapon is deception he's been working overtime with deception deceiving people taking up parts of the word making whole bibles that left hope books of the bible out or twist what they say i tell people make sure if you read the word of god it's got the whole counsel of god there's some that take out the millennial reign of christ they even take out the tribulation some of them even say it's okay to sin and there's some people never heard any of this before but it's true because the enemy is doing whatever he can to deceive us amen and obviously some people have been deceived by believing a lie so i don't work for hell i don't represent hell i have nothing to do with hell there's no darkness in me i do not tolerate any acts or words or thoughts of the enemy i serve the most high god and him alone will i serve it's okay with me if people don't like my pink hair they will be taken to the welcome center when they get to heaven because you see people with every color of hair in heaven that's where the rainbow lives and the one who carried you you lived in that rainbow before you came here you had a little spirit of life that was your little spirit person lived in the father that's why we are his offspring you wrote on the rays of the rainbow in and out of him you played in the river of life inside of him you jumped on the stones of fire that burned with passion for you and i'm like and that river of life goes over those those gemstones massive gemstone filled with a fire it shoots that rainbow out of him you lived there so he made a plan with the word on how to bring redemption how to bring mankind back to him in heaven some of the angels still call jesus christ the word you all know what the bible says the word was with god and was god and there was nothing that was made that was not made by him he had flesh put on him he agreed to come and die and that put on that cross and carry to that cross every sin wicked evil act word intentions he drank it in that cup in the garden even when he didn't want to did he give up his will did he say to the father not my will but your will be done and he drank all that evil he died in the garden when he surrendered himself because it wasn't just his body that had to hang on that cross every evil act and sin had to be put on that cross and someone who was perfect and holy had to carry that to the cross he was guiltless he was innocent no sin in his life even when he walked on this earth and yet he was willing to take that in him that is why he is the only one who can forgive your sins because he took those sins to the cross there's no other being that can do that for you there's no other religion out there that can say that you can get into heaven he is your way back to the father and part of his reward was when you die and moved to heaven you're not lost you didn't lose somebody moved jesus christ is to walk you up the steps of the throne and say here father i have brought your son or your daughter back to you that is why heaven rejoices and throws the biggest party ever every time someone comes home because jesus is going to get to do that that's part of his reward he loves to call you to get undone and when you step on whatever you came in whether it's one of heaven's elevators whether it's a starship or it's christ's chariot there's many ways he can take you up to heaven when you get out you'll step into the river of life right there coming out of the city and he will start throwing water on you and you will have a water fight that's what you will have and you're going to see people dancing and singing all over even outside the gates they'll be celebrating there's music everywhere the flowers sing the trees sing the ground is alive the sky is alive and you're stepping into life and some people are like i thought we couldn't play music [Music] i thought it was going to be silent in heaven that was only one dime it was only one time when it was silent in heaven that was it not since then you look for someone to be quiet you'll find a place and then the trees will start talking to you or the rocks or the creatures there's life everywhere so they have actually got a welcome center i'm not making it up you're gonna laugh even harder when you see the humor of god this whole family i knew growing up in our city that owned all the funeral homes were strong believers they had compassion and kindness for people and one of the heads of all that was about ready to go home to heaven and god had me take this paper scroll paper and write in gold inc his word for that man that was rare for me to get a word for a person i usually prophesied corporately and i took it to the funeral home he was even in his 90s he was still there greeting people's families he had known for a long time and he's about to go inside and i said richard could i give you something and he said well what do you have i said i have a word from god for you and he started to cry on the sidewalk he said all my years of living and caring and loving no one has ever given me a word from god i said well he's going to tell you your future in heaven going to tell you what you're going to be doing and god wrote all these beautiful words about him about he had been given a heart to care and great compassion and understanding to help people go through a a time in their life and god said you always got them when they were going to heaven but now you will get them when they're coming to heaven because i'm putting you and all your family in charge of the welcome center and this is the human reset you may tell everybody that you know your family now gets them going and coming and he was so undone and i said god would not let me just speak that word to you he has this scroll prepared as if he had handwritten himself it was this beautiful paper parchment paper i said this is your word and when you go home in a couple of weeks she said you'll be going in a couple of weeks you can let your brother know who's remaining what his future will be i said when he said that to me right yes he took me up to heaven i saw your brothers they all look alike i saw your brothers i saw your father in this beautiful building and i saw people when they would get out of these transports and they're like this and they would walk in and say come on we're going to make it all okay yes you're in heaven i know it's more than you ever dreamed just come with us and we're going to explain and they had such compassion and kindness for the people and i love to tell that story because it shows you the humor of god but the reward of god he doesn't forget the kind acts that you do so i actually can say and you can say you know who's running the welcome center it is the heritage family from the hardest people and and i went to visit him once when he was in the hospice and i took him a picture of the portal in heaven i've been taken to where people look down and see their families and they can declare over them they go every year to sing happy birthday to you from from heaven and it's a beautiful place i was taken to they have them all over heaven and i i put that right beside where he was lying so he could look at it and he said i will never forget your act of kindness that you gave me god's word when i needed it the most and he said i am so looking forward to running the welcome center and about a week after i went by there i was driving down the road and i knew where that where he was and that beat this beautiful hospice place and i actually saw him leaving with angels being taken up to heaven and god said look to the right and he said richard's leaving because i was obedient he allowed me to see him leaving and so i was very blessed so i started calling people richard richard heart just went to heaven before anyone else knew he went to heaven and i just saw him he was leaving forever people are used to that for me and then they said then they had a head on the news because he was well known all the city uh we we we mourn the passing of richard harder to this day such such a time and i went thank you god for letting me see that so they celebrate from the time they step out of that old body this body is part of you it's what sleeps but you your spirit man never sleeps even when you're sleeping now your soul never sleeps that's a spiritual part of you your soul is awake you play music christian music at night you're feeding your soul if you play the word of god at night somewhere that's feeding your soul even things that like learning or mentoring tapes you're feeding your spirit man that's going in your soul what you hear goes in your soul and it can begin to change you some people i can't sleep in music i have it going 24 hours a day in my place in more than one room i want to saturate my walls i can walk in my home even if it's not on and i hear the music that plays all the time it remains in the room your words remain in your rooms where you live sometimes i walk in someone's home and hear things i don't like i'll step outside and i'll pray over them and break the enemy off at their home images remain in your home by stuff you watch we need a great understanding of our soul your soul doesn't sleep okay you feed it 24 hours a day your body gets fed three times a day sometimes five times a day in america probably five times or more and now you're all eating cake so you can add that to your list so your body gets fed several times a day right your spirit man god said sometimes once a week i feed mine every day i make sure my spirit man gets back the word of god whether i listen to it whether i read it or i listen to powerful speakers online knowing about the internet god designed the internet by the way not the devil it does not belong to the devil amen and these moods of god coming literally some people will have angelic beings come out of their computers this is a portal this is a portal it is a portal your computer is a portal your ipad is a portal whatever can carry images or transmit stuff it can transmit heaven or the other place you need to be careful what you put on here amen i'll be somewhere and i'll see things up like i'll see things come right out of the tv i'm very careful i need to teaching somebody i'm very careful about what my eyes see okay i don't want to put stuff in my soul it doesn't belong there i'm going to keep it sorry i'm going to keep my soul pure i want it pure and it's not that hard it's a lifestyle being like christ should be a lifestyle it's not a sunday thing although i'm thankful people actually go on sunday of course some people can't even go on sunday now but i want you know california is breaking all the rules right now california has had it with the lockdowns and i know this was speaking about american that's what i'm leading up to you have to remember what the father said okay the enemy is not in power right now in this country it is not god still is trump still is he is a president he is the one who's in power he is in office so when the righteous are in office or they're in power that people rejoice that's why he's telling everybody to eat cake amen the worst thing you can do to the enemy right now is to celebrate you celebrate like it's already happened you know what this picture says call those things that be not as though they were that means you act like they've already happened so if you believe victory is coming and it is then you should act like it he sets a table a table is what you eat from it's what you celebrate from that's what he's saying he's saying that scripture even the mystery very good thing around you he can set a table of celebration for your life and it must have everything around you and that will begin to combat the darkness because the enemy sees he's not winning our life gets brighter that he put in us when you got born again you got part of the light of god put in you some people's light would blind the enemy some of you can already see it when you begin to stand for what is right and you don't step back that life society begins to blind the enemy and he gets terrified and i asked the father what else can they do they prayed they fasted they laid on their face they've encouraged people and he said they can eat cake and celebrate [Applause] and every time he's called me up to heaven guess what they're doing they're eating cake because they've already seen the victory happen amen the father's been from the beginning to the end in the end at the beginning and then you'll let you know you were there too before he made this earth and he sent you from himself he had already been from the end of the beginning the beginning of the end he'd already been there you were in him when he went there and made things you were in him living in him you've already been yourself from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning because you're you're eternal beings we are eternal amen if you're born again one day you'll be immortal immortal means you can't sin you can't get sick you can't die that's your future some of those behind that barbed wire will not have that future amen so these are great days that we're living in but the father chose to explain things to you so it's perfectly clear to you like it is to him our country has a great future because it will impact this world we will be we'll we will be changes atmosphere changers amen we walk into place because of christ in us the atmosphere will change smith wigglesworth used to walk into places and people would fall on their face begin to cry out to god that was a measure the measure he's given us now is beyond that original measure you drive past people's homes and they'll in your homes fall out under the glory people will see your roofs on fire because the fire of god in you in your home people will walk in and out of the walls to go speak someplace one day i won't come by plane i'll walk through the wall and come right out on the platform these are greater days of glory that we're entering into and he has to expose the evil and it has to be dealt with it can't be taken off the earth at this time but it will be crushed back and we will rule with great authority and dominion we were given it by christ jesus he never let anything stop him in this earth not even time he was over time he would step in the spirit realm and walk through the people he didn't walk around the people i've been to the amount of the precipice i've been there i was in israel last year on the tour that they bushwhacked me with because no one told me i'd have to be on the bus at 8 00 a.m when i laid down at 7am and no one told me as the speaker of this tour to 18 places in israel i climbed the mountains i went down inside of mountains i've been to every significant place in israel that it mentions in the bible and i thought i was going to have a nice place to speak in the hotel and i do a couple meetings a day and i have to go here my husband was laughing the whole time and i told steve showed someone you bushwhacked me they hooked a microphone on me and recorded everything he said wherever god says the prophets i do it well he had something to say everywhere i went where the fire came down before elijah i got to speak on the sea of galilee they had a fox so thick the boat couldn't leave so i commanded the fog to lift and it was gone in three minutes i don't tolerate the weather being over me it wasn't over christ was it right he was not afraid of anything in the enemy the enemy would run from him the demons would scream when he would be around them and he walked as a righteous man on this earth he chose he had to choose with his will he had to live just like us he was still the son of god but he's also called the son of man he's appointed with every single thing that we're tempted with or attacked with and yet he was victorious in every way in his life why because he was setting an example for us you can live that way i live that way it's different but it's fun it's fun to walk holy because you choose to be holy people say you can't be holy i said the bible says we can it says he's coming for a church this is one of the reasons why he's not coming right now should be pretty evident the world will know us by our love for each other i challenge you to go talk to some worldly people and ask them if you think the church loves one another it says in the bible they will know us by our love for each other so guess what he's not coming right now roll up your rapture rug and stick in the closet it clearly says the wealth of the wicked and they sure have a lot that's been pretty evident for everybody the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just and the righteous that has not been transferred yet are you willing to leave without that it says even by christ himself the works i did you will do how many people do you know are walking on water raising the dead that stinks they're in the grave so long making food appear everywhere wherever they need it to appear stepping in a boat and transporting it in time itself in the spirit room and walking through places we need to already be doing that because those greater works are coming rapidly when you will raise the dead in the funeral that was cremated where you will stop an earthquake that started and tell it to put it back the way it was before it came where you tell the weather what it can and cannot do we have to be ready for those things because he's not holding them back once he does this what he is going to do is setting the platform for us he's not doing it just to bless the world it is for the body of christ to step up and be who we were called to be you were born here because he wants you here you're an american you're here to represent god himself that's why he made america he calls it his gift his first gift was his son his second gift to the world was america where people walk in righteousness and they have liberty and freedom and justice in their country where they honor and respect him and they're not ashamed of who he is the moral majority in this country did vote on november 3rd and they chose justice liberty and freedom we didn't choose the other stuff that the devil tried slipping in their lives are not going to be good because they chose what was wrong and they feed upon people and they destroy people they want to crush our country they want to make it into a third world country they don't care about anybody's color of their skin they care about nothing but evil and wickedness hurting and harming they will use anything they can to make their point and they will lie every time they do it so god is not tolerating what they have said will happen it will not happen and it will not remain and it will not be forever it will not be very long down the road before what he showed me will happen he showed me when that freedom is announced he showed me when they will be forced to announce the election was [Music] stolen four years he needs to continue what he has started god gave him to start in this country i think he's going to be a little bit more tempered having had to see all the evil but i promise you he despises evil and when god first showed me trump he said he is an all-american boy who is all for america that's how god himself described him and he has lived that before all of us even with the hate never and our history of our country has a president been so wrongly accused and hated and just people feed on that i mean they feed evil feeds on that and then when others came in to join them and decided to collude with them that means it became a part of what they were planning to block everything we said that was truth they wouldn't allow they don't want people to know the truth so if they can keep the truth from being heard that what they want will happen but they're wrong about that too some networks will be lost they won't exist anymore because of the lies they conspired to overthrow this country anyone who committed conspiracy to overthrow the presidency or to oversell the country are going to prison amen kids don't hear about already overseas they're making arrests for those who from other countries leaders of other countries people in high places in other countries have already been arrested and i think they're going to get as many from there as they can and then they're going to it's going to happen here you will see you will see justice justice will be served amen to miss your destiny nor your future amen it's just going to get greater and greater in the days to come these are not the days of great darkness there will not be cities burning other than the ones they burned their south and all those cities that have been burned people were paid to do that they were all hired even the people for black lives matter antifa they have paid for all of that to be done not to help anyone they're using them they even make promises to china for things and now people are wanting to collect on the promises so now some of them behind the barbed wire are hiding because they can't deliver what they thought what they would already have in their hand by now they thought we'll have civil war half the people will be dead we'll just go in and collect everything and take over we're not gonna have civil war we don't want civil war we have freedom we have our lives we love our families so they're never gonna get us to do that amen and this is from the father they will never get your guns there's far too many redness in america and they will take you down he even shocks me sometimes there's so many things that he says but i i have to agree because i know some of those run maps he said they'll never reach them they'll be dead before they can get to them one of the reasons why they haven't done anything is we can still get them because we have our arms it's written in our papers we have the right to bear arms is that correct we have many freedoms and liberties given to us in our constitution they're trying to twist everything they can it's still not gonna work and until god i'm glad you're gonna do something quicker than later because the rednecks aren't gonna wait much longer my brother has a hotline to him if you even heard about my brother go back and look at some of those videos you hear about him he is all for justice he has to make out himself he has a hotline from homeland security and some other groups that are organized should they need their help their guns are ready and trump said there's a reason why i said go home and go home and stay safe you know i will be back please try to keep us you know not not get upset or not have fear come in us and the other thing god promised was he will take the virus off the face of the earth for the site for devious purposes to bring heart to you the social distancing was to keep us apart so we wouldn't come together although the bible is very clear don't forsake the gathering together of yourselves and so he's against social distancing in case you wondered he doesn't like it there's no social distancing in heaven and there's no mask in heaven there's not even handshakes there's only hugs and i keep telling people we're gonna have a mass burning party one day i am not ignorant to the fact that there are some people who have compromised lives already you know they have issues if they want to wear them let them wear them i'm not against them wearing them i'm against me being forced to wear one when i don't need what i want amen is going to change and i don't like it every time they say the new normal they can have them in normal but it's not going to be in this country we're safer apart no we're not safe or apart right that's never been true we're safer together amen we're here together we're in this together and we have a god who has a plan he says he hasn't gone on dates everyone else pip so they jumped off the wagon they're wagging a victory in celebration they just think we're just going to give it and i'm not rolling over to anybody are you amen no i'm not giving that up i know god has a plan and hang in there you're going to be really happy that you were some of the ones who said all along victory is coming and everyone will have to eat their words but they'll still be happy that we're free amen so you remember jesus who we belong to and gave ourselves to hold your life in his hand no man hold your life in their hand he wants us all to be free even the bible said god never intended for a person to be over us he wasn't all for the kings at all he didn't appoint kings man wanted a king to be maybe you didn't know that back in the old days they demanded to have a king be over them and so from that point on there's always been leaders presidents kings those in authority over people that's why he said when the righteous are in power the people rejoice because they have a good one when the wicked is they're not going to rejoice amen we are rejoicing amen so i won't talk but a few minutes more because you know i'm you know when i'm finally awake which i'm kind of awake you don't know but i'm actually sleeping [Laughter] it's hard to get up in the morning for me that's my that's my night time and i tell people it's not the next day until i go to sleep and i wake up then it's the next day my family has mostly adapted to the way uh my hours are i like that since i was little my husband used to go to sleep at ten o'clock no matter what was going on he can hang in there until midnight at least sometimes one in the morning my mom will hang in there to two or three in the morning with me she's going to be 90 next year and she said if she had her way she'd be taking a plum switch up to that barbed wire and be making some changes herself she's still my mom and i'm blessed that she lives with me but she definitely has her own opinions about things and she's not happy with it either but she also understands and she does pray for people people who are seniors in certain situations in their life she prays all the time for them she actually has an anointing for people for married couples that can't have children she's highly anointed and she prays for you i have a baby in nine months it has happened over and over and over usually when she comes to me she has her own prayer line so she's brought many babies from heaven to earth by praying for people releasing her anointing to to bring them from heaven to earth for god uh she still doesn't she still prays for people and it works her faith is there she operates i operate you know in the revelation zone she operates in the baby zone so i i love what i do i love people i can honestly say i love you i love you with the father's love and he does have great plans for us and i wish everyone could hear these words he cares he doesn't like sickness and disease he doesn't like anger he doesn't like violence he doesn't like life being taken from us that's nothing he purposed for us and so if people don't know jesus christ i will encourage anybody watching right now that you make sure you receive jesus christ as your savior it gives you more than just hell insurance okay it gives you authority dominion it helps you to step into the supernatural and in these days of greater glory we'll see things never seen before on the earth for the signs and wonders that will be done people will be shocked and stunned to see really the power of god in us because of his son so i look forward to seeing you all again and i i pray that you have a blessed day oh i'm absolutely going to be speaking at the inaugural prayer breakfast okay for the president i got to pray for him back in 2000 when they had the last prayer breakfast i actually got to pray uh for him for the vice president for their families for the future of america and i'm telling you god and don't and you reserve your judgment for pence okay don't judge people when you don't know everything that's right you don't understand covert activities you don't know what's going on so reserve your judgment for him okay they're very close they really care for each other i know people in their administration so don't jump on something because you see something or hear something you can't tell everything that's going on especially if it's covert it won't be covered amen [Music] so we will see what is decided about that what decisions are made i do know that god did kick pence for eight years also like he did the president and i need to let you know that means if trump won the election that means vice president pence also won that election amen so we'll see what god's going to do i do want you to get ready to celebrate in your life like you never had before eat cake in moderation and right now i had already asked them if i could teach you a dance if i if i could teach this dance to you i'm trying to find it i actually have now i do have the music can you all play everybody hands now can you dance now i'm teaching them ideas i know [Music] you might have to play that one from your phone [Music] okay well you want to hold it and i'll play it what do you do i'm trying to stop it first because i have to teach it to you first because we can play it up with this pa system my husband brother okay my son now we're going to practice this first if you go why do you do this because it's heaven culture okay uh church is supposed to be fun amen it is fun in heaven but when i started speaking not only did i have to show up with my pink hair which creeped out a lot of pastors i don't know why i thought you know and i even knew like 40 some pastors in mine was sitting they said you've gone too far you fell off the edge so now we can't work with you for what if i had a pink hat on would you it's just a while what some people will look and go know that you don't qualify anymore well you know the holy spirit already warned me and he i actually saw angels doing this dance that we're gonna learn in my own church we had a prophet um several prophets come we had a panel they did a q a session and all their angels were standing behind them on the platform because i see the angels see all of yours by the way they're excited you're going to do this dance they're going to be doing this dance with you okay and so i saw them doing this dance and i'm like well that's wild that looks like fun what was that the holy spirit said they're doing the revelation dance because the people have received revelation this day and they're excited and then i went to canada about two weeks later and i was speaking with people there we had four hour meetings they would break for lunch and we'd come back i said boy they did it and and in the second meeting the host who said you're gonna teach them all that dance what dance the humor in all this is all three of my daughters their gift is dance they do ballet do all the traditional beautiful stuff they're anointed people been raised from the dead when they dance they've been healed when they dance it is who they are and i don't dance at all i've been kicked out of jazzercise classes okay and now he's telling me all my daughters laugh hysterically every time i talk about you have to teach them you're teaching everyone in through this dance because we want them to celebrate they're going to learn to celebrate when they receive revelation they need to celebrate and so i did and i think the only song i at that time knew about was when the saints come marching in so i talked to him and so when i get back to where i live um i heard this music and the holy spirit said that's the music we want you to learn to teach it to them and that's that's a secular song he said yes but we like that song we want everyone to dance they're going to dance when they get to heaven they may as well practice now and so ever since then i have taught this dance to that song and does anybody here know that dance anyone i know you do you're gonna come up here if anyone has done the students before you can come up here a couple of you come up here come on 

Kat Kerr's TALKING About Heaven: God Is The Greatest Creator | Must Watch!

that he showed me and what it's like to live in that celestial realm heaven is huge it's actually a planet much bigger than our world when christ did before the saint hedron court he didn't say i am not of this world he said i am not of this world because he's from the world called heaven in the book of john it says in my father's house are many mansions and many people think how could that possibly be if god has a house how could there be room for mansions in it well when he says house he's talking about the world called heaven there are many places in the celestial realm in the atmosphere of heaven but in heaven itself there are millions of mansions there's an amazing throne room the streets of gold reflect the glory everywhere you go people who live there couldn't possibly come back here and live after having experienced being with the father or being with jesus you've never felt such love in your life people ask me all the time what do you look like and i tell them he looked like love if you could imagine waves of this powerful love permeating every bit of your being you feel like you're being pulled into his heart and if you ever get close enough to see his eyes you're never going to want to come back you feel like you could never live apart from him he's such an amazing being and he is love all love flows from him all creation our revelation all wealth all light that's who god is the great creator the one who made everything that was or is or ever will be he has always existed that's one question you'll never get answered when you get to heaven his name is i am and that tells you a lot right there but because he does exist and he made us to be in his image he made this amazing place for us to go home one day and live with him there's many scriptures in the word that talks about heaven in hebrews 11 it talks about it being a country and a city in hebrews 12 1 it talks about an amazing place in heaven it says there is a great cloud of witnesses so run your race get the sin out of your life get any weight or anything that hold you back get out of the way so you can get that goal that would be heaven we all came from heaven in the book of philippians it says our citizenship is in heaven so you may be an american you may be um someone from paris or from the uk or from canada maybe you're canadian but you know what we really are all helvenians if you want a nickname for that because we came from that place and god made a way for us to all come back home to him the streets of gold reflect his glory no matter where you go and i tell people if there are streets here on earth and they take you places then surely those pla those streets in heaven take you somewhere also and they do besides the throne room in your mansion you actually create places called memorials of man with your love and your kindness you build these beautiful places that portray how you lived your life down here on earth for him there's a place called the hall of the superheroes where god's intercessors your faces are engraved in that place forever you stand the gap for him for heaven's purposes in the earth and god does not forget that you receive many rewards in heaven you actually have a treasure room in your own mansion and a little later i'll tell you about some of those mansions i saw but god wants you to know heaven is a literal place where you live a real life with him hi this is kat kerr i'm author of revealing heaven and i'm here today with a revelation report on your guardian angel one of the most asked questions given to me is do i have a guardian angel do i have more than one will i ever get to meet them what do they really do for me on this earth since i never see them well i can tell you exactly what goes on around you in your everyday life your angel works very hard to protect you and they're not sent when you're born they're sent the day you're conceived there's a scripture in the word of god that says i knit you together in your mother's womb and i can tell you when life begins at the time of conception god takes a little spirit from himself the holy spirit brings it down to this earth and he actually attaches that eternal spirit to that at that little bit of flesh has taken place in the mother's womb until it happens it's not a living human being from that moment on however you do become a living human being and when you send your little spirit down here and he actually attaches or knits it to the flesh the reason he does that is if he didn't do it it would go right back to the father that's why when a believer dies his spirit leaves and goes back to heaven so they actually have to attach it that's what revelation is on that scripture he knit you together in your mother's womb doesn't mean you put your arms and legs on it means he attached that a little eternal spirit from himself into that little bit of flesh and when he sends it your guardian angel or angels come with you many times i'll see uh pregnant women walking around and i see other angels with them those would be the baby's angels waiting on their birth if if at any time that baby doesn't make it all the way through to the birth date and they pass from this life whether through abortion or through miscarriage their own angels will carry that little spiritual baby back to heaven and let me tell you even though that little flesh may not be fully formed when that baby passes out of his body steps a perfectly formed little spiritual body and those babies can see they can talk they can understand they know who their parents are but i just had to explain to you that your guardian angels come at that time and they stay with you your entire life on this earth and they actually get to help escort you back home to heaven now guardian angels are very different from one another they do not all look the same they actually kind of adapt to your personality sometimes even to the colors that you like and they will defend you to their very end they will do everything they can within their power to help you become that mighty man or woman of god they protect you at all cost and let me tell you when you get to heaven you actually will find out how many times they actually saved your life and you didn't know it and even when you go to church sometimes there are demonic beings there trying to distract you get you angry and offended your angels literally stand around you during that time so that they cannot interfere with your life your angels go everywhere you go even if it's places you shouldn't be going into say for instance you're going to see a movie that you know belongs to the enemy if you go into that movie your angel will have to go with you but they'll cover their eyes with their wings and will not watch what you are watching you have to be careful where you go you need to live your life like your angel actually is there because they are many times god will send other angels into your life during different seasons of your life if he's given you a different assignment at different times you may get more angels given to you at that time and when that season ends they'll go home to heaven but your own guardian angel will never leave you even the very day you go home to heaven they'll go with you and i can tell you right now they will have questions for you when you get there because they were with you everything you experienced you heard you watched every place you went they were there with you and their whole desire is to make sure you make it home to the father so you remember you don't want to have to apologize to your guardian angel so make sure you're living your life like heaven is watching because they are and i hope one day that you too will have the pleasure of going home and meeting your guardian angel one day and uh they will be like a friend in heaven and no they don't get reassigned they earned that r r after living with you on this earth so i pray that one day you'll be in heaven and that you'll be living with the father if you want more information you can go my website revealingheaven.com or or get one of my books revealing heaven series and i hope you have a wonderful day hi my name is kat kerr and i'm here tonight to share with you about the mansions in heaven god has caught me up many years and showed me tours of heaven showed me many of the places he designed specifically for each individual when you come home there to live with him i know that everyone probably thinks that they all look the same or maybe heaven itself it's just a place that's going to be different for everyone who goes there but it's a literal place where you live an amazing life in your spiritual body you're not a little spiritual being that will float through the walls of your mansion god made you on the inside of you is a spirit but when this when you die out of this body steps a spiritual body that looks just like you but perfect in every way and if he gives you a mansion that means you're going to live there he doesn't give you furniture or furnishings so you float through the walls many people seem to think that but that's not true if it gave you a mansion that means you have property and i've seen some of those mansions and so now i'm going to describe what some of those look like i think one of the most amazing mansions he showed me was the sky mansions and a lot of people love this when i tell the story there's columns that run 80 to 100 feet high up into the skies of heaven and on the top of them are these beautiful mansions most of them are round in in detail they're clear you can see all the way through them they may be anywhere from five to eight thousand square feet you step into the bottom of that column and you just say the floor you want to go to and you're right there it takes you right to that floor all around the outside of your mansion is like a huge deck also a landing pad where you would step out and there'd be a little star cruiser the way i like to best describe them is there was an old cartoon show called the jetsons and i tell people go check them out online if you have never seen them they're very similar to that and actually a lot of the ideas that we see happening down here are created down here on earth those things came from heaven and so these amazing sky mansions you can step it on your deck and see all over heaven for miles away color streaks of color go through the skies i've mentioned all the time uh skies of heaven it's like you get your own personal light show another mansion i saw was actually built under the crystal sea they call them aqua mansions people who love to be near the the dolphins or the whales they probably would love to live in a place like that you actually have portals that you pass through and swim in the crystal sea and get to actually swim with the whales and the dolphins is fantastic i've seen some mansions perched on the sides of cliffs 200 feet high in the skies of heaven with beautiful waterfalls cascading around them each mansion looks like a huge gemstone and if you want to go to the back of your mansion as you're walking your whole mansion will turn and rotate as you walk so whatever room you stop in you still have that view of the falls so there's many fantastic places to live in heaven i told one person that i saw one that was built on the top of these 12 massive trees it looked like the most futuristic tree house you could imagine it didn't even have a roof on it and the birds would fly in and sing to the people who lived there the tree branches grew grew right through the walls and flowers would sing to the people in their home they're fantastic places in heaven and the reason they're not all the same is you're not the same everyone is an individual person you all have your own likes and dislikes your favorite colors and style and i promise you the reason you can't take anything with you is because it would be worthless compared to what god has for you in heaven your family and friends will live right near you they'll visit you and stay with you for a while then you go visit other people you fellowship all over heaven besides going to the throne room even the disciples will come and visit you in your mansion and and on your mansion's grounds are things that you always wanted to do but never could for instance if you always wanted to have a horse i'm sure you have a hundred you probably have a ranch with an amazing mansion on it and everything you need for people to come and ride those horses god provides that for you but you'll never have to clean them feed them worry about them getting sick none of that happens in heaven and their greatest desire will be to ride your family and friends all the time and some of them actually will even fly and i know you think this sounds fantastic but you know what we serve a supernatural god and heaven is not a natural place it is a supernatural place hi this is kat kerr i'm the author of revealing heaven and i'm bringing you a revelation report today of the realities of the unseen realm many people do not realize or even want to believe that there is a spiritual realm around them they think that's all connected to the new age movement but let me tell you the spirit realm was here long before the new age movement was here um it's always existed it was the actual original realm before this physical realm was built that you now live in on this earth god made this earth so that he would have a time space planet that he could send us down here to be born become uh men and women receive him and go home back home to him and that's why he made this planet but all around this planet and on this planet there is also a spiritual realm and that's where your angels are your guardian angels angels on assignment are here scribe angels courier angels they have many duties sent from heaven down here to this earth but the other guys are also here too the demonic realm the darkness the satanic realm whatever you want to call it they also live in that spirit realm and yes they see everything you do your angel is not the only one that knows where you go and they know what you're watching the enemy also knows and he has plots and plans against you and the things you do in your life you are either going to draw heaven into your life or hell into your life you have to understand that on the inside of you is a spiritual body and you die and you leave that physical body your spiritual body is going to go and live with whoever you belong to you certainly want to make sure that you go home to heaven where you live an amazing life filled with love and joy and adventure but should you go to the other place you also will experience things even in your spiritual body you will experience all the pain all the suffering all the agony all the fear and let me tell you god does not send anyone to hell you choose to go there by rejecting the blood of jesus christ in the spiritual realm there aren't just spiritual beings but they're spiritual places there are kingdoms that have been built by the enemy and he actually has king spiritual kings there are some of the fallen angels that he has assigned to rule and reign over different regions on this earth even some from the very atmosphere of the sky there's also a second heaven i'll talk about that later but right now i want you to know that what you do in your life is going to either draw darkness in or light into your life one of the ways i want to explain that is what happens when you pray in the spirit realm the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman availeth much that would be much power when you pray that way in the spirit realm out of your mouth comes a sword it begins to form and when it's fully developed by your prayers the angel of the lord will take that sword and go and fight the enemy on behalf of what you just prayed for not the next day not next week but right then now that's the right way to live your life when you speak things of god to people encouraging words words of life out of your mouth and out of your belly will flow rivers of living water you totally can bring heaven into your home by saying the right things but in the spirit realm around you when you trash people with your mouth when you gossip when you back by when you shred people in the spirit realm out of your mouth will come a cesspool and let me tell you it's as real as the river of life and yes even believers can do this with your mouth you have a choice to use that mouth that says that the power of life and death is in your tongue so please choose life because when you don't you're choosing death that means you're allowing the enemy to come into your life and into your home and if you don't repent for those words that cesspool will not go away demons will come and swim in that cesspool and you just invited the enemy to come and move into your life so you need to be careful the words you speak the word of god says that blessing and cursing should not come out of the same fountain that's talking about your mouth that means that the things you say can affect your life your family's life even your finances your body you speak the right things you need to read the book of james and the word of god it'll tell you how to speak with your mouth and let me tell you the enemy wants you to say the wrong things even strife when strife starts there's a little tiny demon of strife it looks like a spider with a human head and when an argument starts it'll jump on your shoulder and prick you and give you words to answer back to that person who's just said something hateful or angry to you and when you respond and say the words of the enemy it gives them power in your words then it jumps to the other person's shoulder and it'll prick them and give the response back to you and pretty soon hate is coming out of your mouth and you're just swimming in cesspools and actually all domestic violence starts and ends that way if that person doesn't know god they'll just keep going back and forth unto the enemy finally has one of them say i hate you i wish you were dead and the next thing you know someone's been killed and many times that happens and when the police show up they'll tell them i don't even know why i did that is because they gave their self to the enemy with their words please don't let people back by or gossip around you i want you to know the angels collect your words not just the words you speak but the words that you allow to be spoken in your presence because god says whatever you allow in your presence whether it's something you watch you listen to or people say around you that means you are approving of those things so we all need to repent for the words that we've spoken wrong wipe them from our record and start speaking words of life to one another the same thing happens when you go into places where hell lives or operates if you pick a movie that's maybe an r-rated movie that's got sadistic torture a foul language witchcraft vampires which by the way is a spirit of death when you go into movie theaters and watch those things there is a spiritual ledge that is built by the enemy above those theaters those actual individual theater rooms and when you walk in you get vomited on by the enemy they mark you with this green slime i know this sounds wild but you know what that stuff is true you need to know how the enemy operates in your life as well as heaven when you leave that theater you think no one saw you going there but every demon you walk past knows that you just went in there and they'll actually hunt you and get you to fall again and again and pretty some you have so much scum on your spirit you can't hear heaven you can't hear yourself and you're doing things you never dreamed you would do you need to be aware that the enemy has plans for you and they are not good they are only for harm he comes to come to kill steal and destroy you and you need to live your life like heaven is watching and that there is a real spirit realm around you and i pray that god opens your eyes in your ear so that you understand if you want to know more you can go to my website at revealingheaven.com or or get my book revealing heaven and i pray that you'll live your life in the right way in the god way hello my name is kat kerr and today i'm going to give you the testimony of my life why god takes me on tours of heaven how that all started and the process i had to allow him to take me through to prepare me to be able to speak for him i know many people have asked me why would he choose you i can't really answer that question but i can only tell you that he did ask me to go and i didn't say no but i was also willing to let him process me in my life you know when you speak for god you can't have pride in your life you really have to have a humble spirit and most of the time that comes through building character in your life that means anytime you're going to do something significant for god there'll be a significant price that you will pay with your life part of that was done by allowing me to be raised with 14 siblings i can tell you right there that'll do something to sharpen you and get the rough edges off of you and you'll learn right away that it's never going to be about you that you have to learn to share your life and the place you live with many other people you have to consider their wants and their needs not just jerome also god gave me an amazing father my dad loved people he had a personal intimate relationship with the father with the son and with the holy spirit as did his mother and we've actually traced back to the very early 1800s that we've had people in my family line that have walked in a foundation of holiness holiness is not the outward appearance it's your heart it's the condition of your heart are you willing to live a righteous life are you willing to lay down your life for others are you willing to walk in victory are you willing to take a stand against the enemy and not let him rule in your life nor bring things of the world of the enemy into your life and so i had to make a lot of sacrifices in my life i spent four hours a night with the lord usually from midnight to 4am was the time i spent with him for years probably close to 20 years and then he even took me out of my job and took me home for three years to spend eight to ten hours a days with a day with him this was spent worshiping him just talking to him like i am you you know you can have as much of him as you want in your life and there were many other ways he prepared me for this but i can tell you that after having lived my life for him i've been born again from the age of four and i'll be 60 this next year and i don't mind sharing that i think the pink hair helps a little bit with that and by the way if you wonder why i have pink hair it wasn't my idea in 1996 the lord walked in my home after many years of being prepared and told me the father and he were going to start taking me on tours of heaven and i didn't say no i am caught up by the spirit of god just like john in the book of revelation where instantly he was there i don't feel myself traveling my spirit is taken from my body by the holy spirit and then i'm somewhere in heaven god allows me to listen to people talk about their family members shows me their mansions brings me back to earth gives me information about family members on earth and then has me share it with them i did that year after year you know not really sharing it with a lot of people some of my friends maybe some of the church staff where i fellowship at but that was something god had me do i can tell you it changed people's lives for years and then in 2005 the lord walked back in my home and told me that he and the father wanted me to write a book about everything had been shown in heaven they wanted me to illustrate it so you actually saw places that existed in the heavenly realm and then they actually asked me to have pink highlights in my hair i thought about that for a minute and the lord looked at me and goes it's necessary because when the world sees this book and reads this book and they know that you have pink hair and you have a relationship with us they're going to know that we want them and he does want them we're supposed to love one another in this earth and even the word says that the world will know us the believers by our love for one another so make sure you're loving and not judging and not criticizing i had to train my mouth to speak words that god wanted to say and not myself and so you have to understand that if you really want to do something for him lay down your life lose your life that you can find in him and he'll fill you with himself and when you share to other people you'll release a river of life into their being so i just wanted you to know that god loves you he has a plan for your life he wants you to come and spend eternity with him in heaven so please consider if you don't know the lord receiving him this day repenting of your sins and believing that he is the chosen one that paid a price for your life on calvary and then one day we can all enjoy heaven together hi this is kat kerr and i'm the author of revealing heaven but my favorite title would be child of god you know god says you have to be like a little child to enter into the kingdom of heaven and i really have an understanding of why he says that because when you get there you're going to have fun you know god may be eternal but he is not an old-minded god if that were so he wouldn't want you to be like children that means you trust him completely that means you receive whatever it is he gives you with gladness and joy and one of the reasons he enjoys taking me to heaven is i never question him i don't sit down try to figure everything out i don't have to look for 50 references to share what i saw there i'm like a big kid i can't wait to tell you what he allowed me to see there and today i'm going to give you a report on what it's like to live there in heaven one of the times he caught me up to heaven what i was allowed to see in the life of a 13 year old girl who had passed away in february of 2001 my mother and i did hospitality at our church and we had just finished a four-day event we were very tired but because we served our pastor and his wife we allowed them to ask special privileges from us and that's exactly what they did we had a phone call from the pastor's secretary pastor's wife secretary and she asked if we could clean the house of an elderly woman who just hosted out of town guests for a funeral now this funeral was not held at our church it was held about 50 miles away in a different part of our city so we did not know these people that i'm about to share you share about and we'd never met them before we had never been to this person's house before so my mother said yes we'd be glad to clean the home so the next day we should we showed up and my mom told me i could go ahead and start dusting the fireplace mantle she would go start in the kitchen of the bathroom and so i'm standing there dusting the fireplace mantel and all of a sudden i hear the lord say to me i'd like to give melody a message and i keep dusting and i say well who's melody and he says that's marissa's mom and i go well who's marissa and he says that's the young girl who just died in the ski accident you're standing in her grandmother's home i want her mother to know that i did not cause her daughter's death but i had a plan for her life in heaven and i had to decide was i done with her on earth did i have something more important for her to do in heaven and i want her to know that she's living with her great grandfather and he's taking her somewhere to have lots of fun where the lord kept talking then all of a sudden i was no longer standing in front of the fireplace i was on a path in heaven the lord told me to hurry up and so i could hear the people there was three people on the path in front of me now you have to understand when you're caught up to heaven it's not just like walking down the path of any any woods down here on earth angels are flying by you the flowers sing to you when you walk by there's light shows continually going on in heaven you hear music coming from everything because everything worships god in heaven and so it was hard to not focus but i finally got up there and i heard this young beautiful girl she has strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes i knew that was marissa and she was looking into the eyes of someone who did not look like a great grandfather he looked like he was in his twenties he she was saying things to her to him about her mom when i see her again i'm gonna kiss her on both cheeks i'm going to share everything that's happened to me i wish i wish she knew that i was a youth leader in heaven and so she just kept sharing and i was listening and we got closer i could hear people laughing and hollering and yelling and all of a sudden i see a roller coaster in the distance and i'm shocked and the lord said that's the rush that's our largest roller coaster and that's where her great grandfather was taking her i got close enough to see the people this roller coaster these cars would zip up to the top go all the way to the bottom and zip back up and leap off the track go across the sky to the other side of the track and i thought they sure don't do that on earth and so she kept talking about her mom and then the next thing i knew i was back down in front of the fireplace i was really shocked and so i called my mom we called the pastor secretary and they gave us melody's phone number i went home typed everything down i heard and she agreed to meet me at a mall and sort of started sharing with her that i had seen her daughter in heaven and i saw her great grandfather taking her on wrote to go take on roller coaster rides and she almost fainted i asked her she wanted me to keep reading and she just motioned to keep going i kept telling her all the things i heard and melody would laugh then she would cry she began to shake and i knew what she was going to say when i was finished i asked her do you believe i've seen your daughter in heaven do you believe god wants you to have this information and she looked at me she goes i don't know you i never met you but you told me things only my daughter marissa would know every day i dropped her off at school she would kiss me on both cheeks and when she came home from school she would share everything that happened in her life and she said the thing i really know that convinced me that you had been to heaven is the day before her funeral i was in her room and i looked under her bed and found a journal she had kept in 1995 now this experience i had happened in february of 2001 so this was some time ago melody said i had never even seen this journal before so i started reading it and she said i'm one of the pages i read these words last night i dreamed i died early and went to heaven early my great-grandfather met me and i went on roller coaster rides i saw tons of mansions and it was wonderful but he only gave me a peek and then i fell back down to earth how amazing is that i was so shocked there's no way i could have known about that journal or the words were written and yes the very thing that the father showed me he wanted people to know that heaven is real but it's not just a literal place you're actually going to have fun she told me that that information was like receiving kisses from heaven that she loved her daughter very much and then the lord allowed me to share with her what she was doing in heaven he said it was time for all the youth in heaven to begin their part in rehearsing this their the entertainment for the celebration of the marriage supper of the lamb and he looked down through time and eternity and he picked marissa for that position so just because one of your loved ones goes home early it doesn't mean that it was a punishment or that the enemy had his way sometimes it's because god has a reward for their life melody shared with me that marissa had mentored all the kids in her elementary school and her middle school by loving them and she said she could understand why god would have picked her daughter what a high honor to be chosen for in heaven but god wants you to know when you go there you are going to have a life filled with adventure and your loved ones who live there they miss you they love you but you know what they're with the one who loves them more than anybody so i hope you make the right choice with your life and you understand that when you go home to heaven it's like living and moving to the most amazing place you'll ever live so if you want to know more you can read my book revealing heaven or go to my website revealingheaven.com and i hope you come to know the lord and give your life to him hi this is kat kerr and i'm the author of revealing heaven and today i'm going to talk about something that is probably so desired by many people to know and that is the mystery of death and i can tell you when a believer dies they do not experience death the word of god says that christ experiences that for you when a believer dies they depart for heaven they don't descend into the ground and actually before christ died on the cross anyone who was counted to be righteous by their faith and god himself they actually did descend into abraham's bosom but now that place is empty they're no longer there they now all live in heaven with the father but i'm going to tell you what happens from the very second your your spirit leaves your body all the way up till you get to heaven and what happens after you get there and let me tell you you should be excited when a family member of yours departs from this world and they're going home to spend eternity with the one who loves them the most that would be the father and so when you die no matter what you're experiencing prior to that moment whether it was a natural death like you died of old age or maybe it was an unexpected death maybe an accident or even something terrible that happened maybe even murder i can tell you that if that person was a believer the second their spirit stepped out of their body they no longer even thought about how they died they are engulfed in the love and the glory of god for the first time they'll see their guardian angels it's an amazing experience the glory of god comes from the very clothing that they wear sometimes you can even hear sounds from heaven and i'll let you i'll just tell you right now that if you're in a room when a loved one dies please look up and wave goodbye to them because that's what they're doing to you they wave goodbye to their loved ones if they're present in the room they even blow you kisses even either a transport or a chariot is waiting on them when you die and you're going to live in heaven they actually come and pick you up and the way the father put it was whoever owns you when you die will come for you and many times if you've really lived your life for god poured it out for others sometimes even jesus himself comes and picks you up in his own chariot they escort you out of this realm up to the heavenlies through outer space you get to see all the beauty and the wonder of everything god put up there you go right through the galaxies past the beautiful nebulas that are in the skies in the outer space many people call it the prophetic frontier god made that and all the beautiful things in there for us to enjoy watching and looking at and now you get a front view right here in front of you as you go past zipping up faster than the speed of light until you finally see the brightest thing you'll ever see in your life that would be the planet heaven angels pour off of the planet to welcome you home you come up to a landing pad and when you do when you disembark you'll see the glow from the glory of god the city of god beyond the gates your family and friends will be pouring out of those gates grabbing you they can't wait to see you if you had lost a child or even miscarried a baby at any time in your life they'll be waiting for you you don't have to look for your family and friends you'll be able to walk right into the river of life and pick the water up and drink out of it you'll be escorted into the throne room of god where everyone there will part like the red sea jesus comes down the steps of the throne and he escorts you back home to the father every step you walk up on that throne you look into those steps you see creation taking place because life everlasting pours from the person of the father it is jesus's greatest desire and pleasure to escort you back to him and then he'll turn you around and say look my son my daughter they've come home and everyone in there will begin to celebrate that your home in heaven everyone knows your name when you come there they'll have a big celebration party in the throne room i think it's a little strange that on earth we have a funeral but in heaven they have a party when someone comes home up there the rejoicing and down here we're grieving we need to understand that if your loved one belongs to the lord they're in heaven living an amazing life and if they could say anything to you it would be this we can't wait till you get here we can't wait till you see what he has given us the rewards we have our amazing mansion what it's like to just stand and be held by the arms of the father and then take them back down the steps to the throne and everyone dances with you everywhere you go and then your family and friends eventually when they can get you out of the throne room and the unspeakable glory that just abides there they'll take it to your own mansion where they themselves have been collecting you presents and gifts and you have another welcome home party in your own mansion i tell people you do worship god in heaven you do praise him continually they call it living worship because every time you walk into your mansion to see what he gave you you're going to praise him when you walk down the streets of gold and see all the beautiful wonderful things he made for you to enjoy you're going to praise him one person to shout praise god and it echoes all over heaven it starts a chain reaction and everyone once again begins to celebrate the love of the father that he has for you so you don't want to miss going to heaven you don't want to miss living with him never again to experience death or fear or grief or anxiety everyone there knows you they'll call you by your first name you leave it

social body grows inside your physical body you have the features of your physical body but you look a whole lot better in your spiritual body so when you step out of this physical body in your spiritual body you're engulfed in the life and the presence of god your guardian angels escort you up through space all the beautiful things god made you have a welcome home party in the throne room with the father walking up the steps with the glory and this rainbow moving in and out of him like this and it's just this his eyes are flames of fire and he reaches out and holds you to himself because welcome home my son my daughter but he also has the babies oh my gosh so tell me we were talking yesterday about naming your baby yes it's so important that was one of the things he actually said to me when he i was taken on a tour of the nurseries i saw the little babies beautiful places yes now if a child was lost they're living with the closest relative you have in other words if you're if you lose your child no matter what when they get older of course they grow slowly so slowly in heaven even the little babies will grow slowly but when you get to have when they when you get to heaven it could be 50 60 years 70 years later sometimes your baby's still a baby if you want it to be a baby you raise it in heaven you see it develop it's a gift that god gave them because they their true destiny is to use the gift he made them whether it's a drummer an artist a rodeo person an athlete in the whatever it is culinary arts the floors whatever they're all designed to be a gift and they still will use that gift so people think they lose their destiny but they really don't wow so they stay with relatives but the little babies are kept in these beautiful nurseries and the angels rock them and sing to them they don't sleep your spiritual body doesn't sleep not even when older ones go to heaven if you're 100 by the one you die you're going to look like you're in your 20s that's why your grandma doesn't want to come back don't call her back if she's done with her race let her go be young but the babies will grow very slowly but they have an amazing life they're educated jesus comes to see them all the time and so he's even designed places like the babies play pond and things for these little tiny babies go and play he grows daisies little tiny days he's fields of them and they'll pick them and stick them in each other's hair and the deer will come in like i was explaining so they have an amazing they slide down their slides are rainbows mini rainbows and they slide down these mini rainbows but they love their parents and oh they forgive their parents when these little aborted babies go to heaven or the person who actually did that they forgive everyone they live in love they are filled with life and they know who their parents are they're up there declaring the whole time i want my mom to come to heaven my dad to come to heaven and the father said you make sure you tell them when you go back name your baby it's important that they get named because that identifies them as part of your family or a part of you and so this is what they do when they come to heaven if they aren't named the angels give them a nickname and over their beautiful little beds they look like this this alabaster mother of pearl beautiful shells with the most beautiful uh blankets and stuff they stand and play they climb up the roses you know they play all the time or sing they dance but they have a name like precious or beloved that the angels give them but they want their parents to name them so i'm really going to encourage you god said if you don't know if it's a boy or go pick one or the other and whichever one it is this is what they do when the parents decide to name their baby god sends for that baby from the nursery he holds it in his hands and said your mom your dad just named you this is your name now forever and ever and the baby celebrates and they have a party and they and they go change the name in the nursery to the name that you gave them and then you're connected with your baby and they're they'll watch they'll be watching from heaven while you name them so they know oh you just name me and they fall in love with you even more so you have a life a future together in heaven i'm going to give a real quick example for about 30 seconds there was a child who died at seven i think he was hit by a car on the road and 40 years later his mother died on the operating table for 20 minutes she was in heaven saw her son playing still seven years old in the streets of gold i think his grandfather somebody was there and he goes mom you're here he knew who she was mom you're here come here and they were hugging and laughing and he goes i know you're here but it's for a short time she goes what have you been doing he goes mom i've been playing i have friends you know i'm so happy he said but your life isn't over you have to go back and for years after that this woman and her husband went around sharing about her trip to heaven so there's proof that your child will still be young and you get to raise them in heaven watch them grow laugh play the babies there'll be no nursing no all night no none of that okay and you'll have a life of eternity together because god loves you

[Music] sit in this moment I want everybody lift up your hands right now because the Lord is fighting for us he's fighting our battles but every single one of us we need to humble ourselves before God we need to surrender everybody say some letters and of course surrender is the attitude abortion because it's not worshiping all as a sacrifice if it does not cost us that it's not true worship and I believe in this day is our tool Orson can you surrender your mess can you give me your Isaac not your Ishmael can you give me your first up your glass can you give me your first choice not the worst can you give me your Isaac in his timing at this hour and I believe a surrendered is a language of worship a man and of course the one seated on the throne it's not the life of the tribe of Judah but it's a Lamb of God who willingly gaining his life to be slain on the cross even before the creation of the earth began and Jesus the language of love is surrender so mercy surrender sir because surrender is worship just sacrifice so lay down your life and I believe it's time to see if the looks he's asking me saying are you willing to lay down your life changed oh really are you willing to drink from the same company of the night it's not up to me to decide who's gonna sit on my right and who's gonna send a mother it's not up to me the father is all the way to decide that but it's not up to me can't you willingly tweak up this cup now of course this cup is a cup not just a suffering but authority someone say glory the happier the suffering that heavier the glory the greater the verdict you've gone through then the more you'll be able to be held in the glory of God and I believe in this time this hour the Lord is purified he's refighting he you verify it is refighting so that we can be perfect someone's a perfect life two goals and I'm telling you Jesus will receive the reward of his suffering he will receive this beautiful precious spotless blameless bride even in 2020 he will receive the doom inheritance of his reward amen hallelujah so I want everybody just lift up your hands oh look it just complete you to surrender just begin to lay down your rights right now continue to lengthen out your front laid out your kids laid out your future lay down your plans that you had gonna happen with a man to even Jesus himself said don't boast about what you're gonna do tomorrow where you gonna go where you gonna go here or there but Jesus himself said you can't even count the hairs on your chinny chin chin please dead fearful ones someone say fear God is releasing the fear of the Lord once again and I nation Amen come on he's releasing the spirit of the fear of the Lord at this time and that's gonna cause us to be an honor wonder to surrender to worship to give up to lay down to lay it all down right now give us clean hands and a pure heart Oh Lord listen in a few minutes we're gonna have the woman of God get her with us okay but we're trying the atmosphere

security hallelujah father we pray and every single person who's burdened every single person does heavy ladings every single person is worried who is stressed father lift it off release the power and

somebody I see right now that the Lord is putting sandals on your feet I see right now that the Lord is putting a robe upon your back amen come on he was about to kill the fat - he was the prodigal - coming the prodigal are returning home because just a blessing with your name on it there's a blessing with your family name on it in the vortex of what the Lord is doing right now it is vortex and it's a movement of angelic hosts and glory there's something that he's attaching you to and I'm telling you he's not a Patrica - Devils it's not attached to you to curses he's attached to you - the Holy Spirit do what forever and join with him you are forever entwined with him you want for ever one with him come on someone say Amen come on for you on a one- spiritus amen stop a bustle treat

about sharing tonight about what God's plans are you know I no man has their plans and there's certain things that need to take place but in God's time he's going to get his way and I can tell you this is an exciting time to be alive and God talks to me about the great things he's got planned not just for right now but things will impact your entire future so when I speak I'm talking about not just now but your future and the future things of God also the near future not far future and so I'm excited by what he's saying he speaks to me all the time after she was just speaking to me in the other room before I came in it's really hard to leave him but you know this is something that we have to share with people on this earth and so I welcome everybody here and I thank God for Bend that he invited me to be a part of this great prophetic experience for everybody and so I know when I'm speaking I feel like I'm speaking to the whole world so I'm not just talking about here in the state where I live or in California even but where God's people are all over the world and I want to encourage you and inspire you you be great for him in this time just shine like the stars in the heavens that's God's plans for us regardless of what's going on in the net trol and especially regardless of what the enemy has got planned we need a shine for our God his light is in US and the more we do that the greater that light gets you know that she can be so filled with him at one point that when the enemy looks at you all he sees is a burning Inferno because our God is fire you know he is he's a guide of life light and fire and we carry all those things inside of us when we receive Jesus Christ you did get redeemed your sins got washed away but you became royalty on this earth you are the ones who have authority in the earth over the earth have all power over all the power of the enemy we need to make a difference in this world and that's what my whole life is for is to please my God and to rule with my lord and so tonight I'm going to share some things about ruling and reigning I'm also gonna talk about selling things going on right now in your life I know this is a challenging time but sometimes in the challenging times is well shine the brightest is when God sets a table in the presence of our enemies and I'm not talking about natural enemies I'm not talking about me and I'm talking about our spiritual enemies he sets a table in the midst of all that they're trying to do against us and he begins to manifest in US and through us and demonstrate with us this is a time to be blessed as a father even when we start this I think you God for this opportunity to speak on your behalf and share what your plans are and what things look like according to you what you see from heaven what does heaven experiencing right now watching us on the earth I know right now the rapture are celebrating that we're this is our time to stand up and make a difference and I think you got for an opportunity to speak to anyone no matter where they are if they were hearing this if they're seeing this message god I release the anointing into their lives God I declare over them wholeness protection blessings for them to stand up and stand up in this day to be a part of what you're doing in this earth and father we take power over all part of the enemy command the host of heaven the army of having to pull down every stronghold over every person watching this destroy every platform the enemy's trying to operate from to expose all the wicked plans of the enemy to crush the darkness to push it back and follow I just declare that doing right now for them for their families for the destinies gone I hope I'll have time at the end you do some impartation but you know what right now I'm going to make sure I get this word in for the father to understand that I desire blessings and manifestations and demonstrations of your power your plans and your presence all over this earth this is truly the time to carry the glory that will cover this earth like that like the waters cover the sea and if none of you have experienced not just carrying the glory but releasing it it feels like a cosmic shock wave leaving you just as if you hit something on the ground and set up this up this this presence of God and this power of God that's what it looks like in the spirit realm and this is what we need to be doing no matter where we are even in your everyday life even if it's to the store to find something to eat or maybe uh spending time with your family make sure you're releasing the presence of God everywhere you go and I share with people all the time and you have a weapon that's put in you from the time you're born again is called the anointing now many people are anointed for specific things like they're anointed to sing they're anointed to be an artist but the anointing I'm talking about is the one mentioned in the Word of God first John 2:27 that says when you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior receive a deposit of the anointing and it lives in you every believer has this even if they don't know it that anointing is such a powerful thing it's what Christ used when the woman touched the hem of His garment and then anointing left him and he felt that power that brooked you lead him it went into her it brought healing the anointing breaks the yoke of darkness and every believer can probably quote that scripture but they may not know what it means it means he is supply what you need to be victorious and successful in this time to crush the plans of the enemy trying to stop you from anything he has for you no believer should have to suffer under any bondage of the enemy we were meant to all over not be under in our lives in this world and I'm an example of living heaven culture in this earth I have no cares I have no fear I have no lack in my life because I feel myself in my soul with the things of God so don't think you're sitting there and you're helpless or you're hopeless that is alive from the enemy you were made to carry the power of the Living God now we only serve one true God we won't serve another and make sure you say that at night before you go to bed you know the father is listening to us crisis will sing to us all the time make sure you say things that bless down how about that that is an amazing thing to bless the heart of the Living God and let me tell you this is the time for us to let people know who he is and who we serve this is not a time to talk about fear with people to discuss all the gaming saloon predictions that are being given when I hear God speak it's always about the power and the glory and to be great for him if you are a believer you have greatness in you make sure you're letting that out this is an awesome time to get to know your neighbor maybe you've never met them before spoken to them I know they have social distancing you know keep six feet apart you saying awful lot six feet away you can even release the anointing into people when you drive by their homes you know when you help people even by making a phone call or texting them make sure you really see anointing into that text and in that phone call I know people think well this is the strange days that we're in I look at them as times of opportunity and do you know what you think about makes a difference in your own life what you think and what you say makes a huge difference in how you operate in your life we should be filled with expectancy and not dread that dread also comes from hell I'm not going to help advertise what they plan to do I talk about what God plans to do so in these days of greatness on the earth and days of opportunity that he is giving us make sure that your light will blind the enemy and bless those around you I thank you God for giving them opportunities father and also instruction Holy Spirit you know speak to them give them tips and and guide them into using the anointing that was put in them so that they will be doing something powerful in this earth and if the body of Christ will stand up and lay down their differences this is also a good time to do that you've got lots of time on your hands make sure you're reading the word make sure you're declaring the word over you your family and especially how you manifest in front of your children and your family if you're the head of the house that is the most important thing you do I know it's important to win the lost and evangelize people but I happen to know that when you first get to heaven do you know what the father will ask you what did you do with your family these are people and precious people he has entrusted us with in our lives even I myself as busy as I am in the supernatural things that he lets me experience I can't just abandon my family those who will listen I help train them in heaven culture I encourage them I bless them I'm a generous blesser I love to bless people whether it's financially whether it's words of hope and encouragement that's what's in me and as a child of God that should be in every one of you let your children see you stand up and pray in front of them pray for your children pray for your teens laying hands on their doors while they're sleeping release the anointing into the room and you know they'll have dreams of their destiny there's many things that you can do especially now that you're spending more time at home that you can actually make a difference create a habitation for heaven in your home I tried to slow down myself sometimes when I'm speaking but there's so much of God in me that he wants to let out and I've had so many encounters in spinning experienced heaven so many times that I'm just filled with lie and love and there's so much revelation and you know some people don't even know what revelation is I'm gonna take them in and explain the difference between information which is man's had knowledge or even research that's man's had knowledge over the ages people who assume things but there's something that a lot of people leave out and that is revelation revelation does not come from the mind of man there is no way you can even conceive of it or even think of the things that God speaks in God knows in he shows if you're willing to listen revelation comes from his heart it's always his will his way and when he explains in very simple terms to us it's so easy to understand you no man can take the simplest thing in the Word of God and make it into an entire syllabus you know maybe 50 pages long and yet people still leave after they've read that without even understanding it but just a word from God or revelation a sentence from God opens up your spirit man it gives understanding to your soul it reveals the Word of God in ways you never dreamed of so why don't you begin to seek after Revelation God says in his word you have not because you ask not I've learned to ask for anything I can consider these are spiritual things that I am asking for how they rule and reign how to release the things of God how to rightly understand the Word of God and how I'm gonna share the Word of God how to live my life holy unpurchased and there's this whole thing going around saying you can't be holy you know you're just human I'm a supernatural human by the blood of Jesus Christ and yes Christ would not say be perfect as I am perfect if we couldn't achieve that it's whatever desire you have in your soul as you think in your heart or your soul so are you so again I challenge you to look at the contents of your soul and actually your soul has a layer so the right way to say that was looking the layers of your soul you know you here people say all the time the commercials what's in your wallet well I want to ask you what is in your layers because what's in the layers of your salt is a whole lot more important than what's in your wallet and what's in the layers of yourself will actually change what is in your wallet and so everything that is built in this earth if it's by God is going to be spiritually discerned and you know the most important thing you can do is to walk in the spirit and not by the flesh I know some pastors talk about the difference between the spirit and the flesh some don't but you know what it says to to be spiritually minded is life but to be fleshly minded is death which means no light no light and you know love and you don't let your flesh rule you okay it's hard I know it's hard to do in the beginning a long time ago it was hard for me but the more I walked in the spirit and discerned the things of God and applied what he showed me and taught me and even just what His Word says to live that way you don't have to live my man's standard you don't have to live by man's expectations gods are so much higher and so much better if we choose that road and right now in this day it is most important that the witness we give to others is one of Hope one of life one that gives them a future not wanting to run away and escape there's so much fear loosed in this world right now and most of that fear is unfounded that means that those things are really never going to happen but all those people when they hear a word about fear or doom and gloom their soul begins it's well on and that's all I can think about therefore that's what they respond to I do want to assure you that as God said several weeks ago and I shared it online then no matter what you hear over these next few weeks what you see or what you hear don't let that keep you from running after the things of God don't let fear interfere in your life because he has great plans for us and if you can see in the spirit realm of things going on the preparation going on for what use about to release to the body of Christ you'd be dancing right now I don't dance in public well unless I'm teaching the revelation dance and that's something they actually do in heaven but you know what your heart should be filled full of celebration I can tell you what heaven is doing right now they're celebrating because they don't have time in heaven but there is a timeline in heaven and they've been excited about these days right now coming on the earth because they are not the last day and you may have heard people talking about you know on the comment one one hitting the earth the four horses of the Apocalypse being set loose guess what they're still in the barn they have met let out of the barn yet there's many generations left that we are to fulfill to walk in to ruin to invent to create to live a life when ever thought possible in this world so things are not going to get worse even the simplest things that take you outside of your box or your comfort zone sometimes you automatically begin to tithe at that this is the days that the Antichrist will be on the earth and the days of the Great Tribulation well I can tell you this awesome from God himself the Antichrist is not yet even on the earth even Jesus himself said when he was talking to the disciples you know that there'll be wars and rumors of wars and nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom shall rise against Kingdom against where we're at right where he said the end is not yet this is not the end of this world God has a lot of things he has left to do and guess who he's wanting to do this you and I this is art time is a buying price to take authority in this earth if you don't like that virus then you tell it it doesn't have the right to be anywhere near you or your family you say with your own words I will not tolerate anything from hell I will not tolerate that virus coming into my family coming into my body I don't have to put up with it that thing comes from hell and God's Word says no good thing we he withhold from those who walk uprightly if you're a believer then you are counted righteous so you do not have to have any of that stuff you don't have to just because it's being talked about I'm not saying it's not really in the earth but God says we have not been appointed under wrath we have not as a body of Christ and so what you say about all of this every day right now it counts for you even for your city are you declaring over your city the guy will invade it this is the time for them to know Jesus Christ you release the anointing into the whoever the leaders are of your city release the anointing you sit home and declare over them recent noting into the Capitol wherever your capital is and I need to take a little drink it's just a moment you know most of my meetings in the past would last four to six hours but I'm not going to make you listen that long okay maybe you don't have that kind of attention span but what he's given me it can last that long and you will not ever be the same as I've been speaking in the spirit there are like golden seeds leaving my mouth and going into every ear that is hearing right now these words is called a frequency God put a frequency in each one of us and your frequency gets stronger the more you release the anointing the more you declare the things of God your frequency and what you speak becomes tuned in with God's frequency when I speak the presence of God is released from my mouth when I hold up my hands and release the things of God it's also released from my hands we're supposed to be carriers of his person it says in the word of God in Genesis God said let us make man in our image that what they look like and after our likeness you know that revelation on that word likeness and Genesis means operate so we are supposed to look like them and how they live and operate like them because God has given you power he's giving you power he's given you authority we're the ones who have the right to rule in this world this world was not designed for Satan nor was it given to Satan he just takes advantage his plan is to kill steal and destroy but God's is to reach the glory the anointing and his presence and his life and you are carriers of all those things you carry his presence you carry the person of Jesus Christ you carry the anointing that Christ put in you when you were born again you receive light in your spirit from the body when he places a stone of fire in your spirit the day you got born again that's when you got that light put in you you are a supernatural being on this earth and not only that you may be mortal right now but one day you will be immortal and yes the word to say that it says there come a day in our lives when mortality that's us right now will take on immortality when you're immortal you cannot sin you can never get sick you can't die this is the future he has planned for all of those all those who receive Jesus Christ that is your future not even what man says about you I know it's hard if some of you are you know quarantined at home or maybe even going through some different measures of the virus take you in a light on yourself right now and say I refuse I refuse to accept this virus I will not tolerate it in my body I command you to go in Jesus name and you may be taking some medicine they gave you and you know I'm not telling you to stop taking it but make sure you release the presence and the anointing of God into your body and whatever you do you don't forget to laugh especially in these days did you know the word says laughter is a medicine and it's health and healing to your bones so you also care that inside of you when you receive it when you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior we all know that there's something called the joy of the Lord to know how much the enemy hates it when you laugh if you've been having fun with your family and especially your children and you have laughed in the presence of your home you're releasing joy in the walls of your home you're creating a habitation for heaven in your very home and you can you can change the atmosphere of your home you can change the presence that's in your home so you weren't hopeless and you aren't helpless I live by that every night and walking through the halls of my of this place where I live and declaring the presence of God I come in the heavens to open and invite the army of having to come down and walk in and out of the walls and up and down in the halls and you know even my family my mother my sister my husband we who live here we have seen angels in this place and even though you may not see them if you're bowing as Jesus Christ you have angels assigned to you if you doing something really focused for Christ you get more angels added to you and I see them all the time when I speak in meetings I will see hundreds sometimes thousands of angels present sometimes you're standing in your own guardian angel as a spiritual being they're not impacted by this physical world that's why they can pass through the walls you know or through buildings do all kinds of things in their spirituality but in heaven which is a spiritual world your spiritual body when you leave this world when you die and move to heaven in your spiritual body it is a tangible body you can feel it you can touch it you can experience joy in celebration you can visit people that you knew on the earth you get to meet the apostles you know and the prophets of God that are up there mostly you spend time with Jesus himself you come and see you all the time in your mansion and in heaven they have no distancing social distancing and Aven will never happen up there it would be hard to keep people away from visiting you celebrating with you and and then the rewards that God gives you you know you get to bless people in heaven by experiencing what he has given you in heaven but do you know the scripture that says our Father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come your will be done on this earth just like it is in heaven you know we're living in that time right now where heaven is really pouring down into this earth and God wants you to know that that heaven is all around you your angels are around you the Holy Spirit is right there if you've been born again he walks beside you but if you invite him to indwell you then he moves into and let me tell you with awful of this stuff that is scriptural I'm not making this out this stuff is biblical is scriptural and it's true everything I've been talking about these are things he gives everyone who he sees his son if you've never activated any of those things if you've never used the anointing you never decreed in declare things that God has said in his word or he has said to you personally you need to stop doing that our actions draw heaven our compassion for others our love for others and our faith draws the very heart of God into our midst so before you think that nothing good can happen to you loose those words out of your soul and out of your very home and you welcome the presence of God in your home because these days that we're in right now will cause you to never be the same again and I'm not saying that in a negative way I'm saying that in a powerful way the days of greatness so we're walking into right now you won't be the same the things that you impart to your family the time you sign with your family your children won't be the same your spouse won't be the same this is certainly a time to come together as a family and we may not be able to come together literally that's the family of gone but we still can have contact with our phones you can call them text them FaceTime them share testimonies share encouragement with people especially if you know somebody's going through something you know you can pray do the face down with somebody who isn't feeling well and release the anointing into them declare a wholeness in their body you would be surprised what happens in the spirit realm when you begin to step up your faith will grow you begin to explode with the goodness of God in your life and this is so important right now for people in this world not to see us fighting not to see us divided but to see us as one because you know according to the word we are his body and he is our head and if we're supposed to look like him and act like him why not focus on some things why not make a list stop making a list of the things that you can declare and decree over your family over your children's destinies over your future and maybe you even lost your job gee no God can give you something better he could even give you your own business these out days to be upset don't let cares you know can consume you don't let cares and fear consume you just loose except out of your soul and find the goodness of God the plans of God years old I can tell you this a day in the court of the Lord is worth a thousand days elsewhere when you have the favor of the Lord over your life he can do the impossible and I can tell you the in these days starting tomorrow even that you will begin to see the things have gone being open for you suddenly when I say the word suddenly that is a powerful thing maybe you weren't even expecting for God to move on your behalf something he may give you a door open for you your future is bright because you belong to him you are important to him and someone there needs to hear this that no matter what you've done in your life if you repent you know God doesn't even remember those things I will tell you this ever certainly we are not supposed to be talking about our past sins or the people's past sins God said you'll get stuck you literally get stuck in a time when those things went on if you keep talking about them loose all that stuff from your soul if you're born again and blood wash you are not even the same person and if you wouldn't want people to talk about your past even though it's done forgiven then don't talk about other people's past if they have been forgiven we are one together we are all together in this not just the Christians either the secular world the non-believers I call them the secular world they are also going through the same things we are but you know there's something different about them most of them don't complain they don't talk about the end is here they don't talk about dooming looming destruction even as they're sitting at home they're making plans as soon as this passes and I promise you this is one thing God has said to me God has never given me a day like resurrection morning April 15 no day I don't have a date on when this will pass but there is one thing you guys say to me it will surely pass so don't make you plans for where you are right now to stay there forever don't make plans that things be so awful by the time this is over you will have nothing remember you shall have us whoever you say so come your words make them work for you work for your family work against the darkness you know God has you in his hand and when you share things he has said to you that light inside of you begins to just if you can see you look like a furnace inside like you've got these flames inside of you when you begin to talk about the things of God and release the anointing and release his presence and declare that your home is a habitation for heaven that flame begins to encompass you even though you can't see in the spirit you look like a burning bush and when you speak things to people when you get to that place it will pierce the darkness in them if your family members are sad if they're in fear mixture declaring over them that that fear be dispelled and removed from them and speak about the life of God even where you're right if your family members live miles away even in another state do you know there's no distance in the spirit you can send the power of God you can send His blessings ask God to show His goodness to them wherever they are right now you know he will move on their behalf and then when you declare and pray for other people he will surely do something for you too because you were being his hands his feet and his voice in this in this day right now in this hour of greatness that heaven is a beautiful place a place beyond our imagination even the word says that that those things that cannot be revealed there unless the Spirit reveal it I love that scripture that says that unless it be revealed by the Spirit of God and so right now the Spirit of God is moving all over this earth people are being caught up in heaven and taking on tours and brought back and I do know a sister Billie Brown she's precious she actually worked for Kenneth Hagin senior for quite a while and she was the one who took his I think all his tapes and made them into books for people to be able to read and he told her at one time these were many years ago he looked at Billy and said not in my lifetime but in your own lifetime God will take people to heaven take them on tours of heaven and bring them back to share what they saw so when she heard about me because God does that with me he still does that with me she was very excited I actually spoke to her on the phone quite a few years ago and I sent her a copy of my book she said I really know this is God because I was told this not just by God but by Kenneth Hagin senior that this would happen and at that time God began to catch up other people from the earth show them parts of heaven I want to encourage you that if you heard different reports of different places in heaven heaven is so huge it's bigger than our whole galaxy there's many places you can go in heaven and maybe you see parts of an area in heaven maybe not all of it then you'll get summing up and show them another part of a place in heaven God names places in heaven I'm just gonna give you a few of them right now besides it's our own room which by the way the Lord Jesus also has his own mansion he had to live on this earth like a man he certainly deserves his own mansion Christ has his own residence in heaven easy and it's wrong room a lot he's in the court room in heaven a lot and he is visiting people all over heaven but I can tell you that there are places God prepared in heaven for adventure for fun for excitement for creativity for gathering together for huge events to take place there is the mountain of spices and mentions in the Word of God that is a real place in heaven it's the highest mountains in heaven we have mountains because heaven has mountains and it talks about in the book of Hebrews that that earth is a shadow of what is in heaven the earth is round even though some people think is not it says Jesus sits over the circle of the earth and so he does this earth is round and so is heaven heaven is a world it's not a flat place in the skies is this amazing world that light shoots out of it out and to beyond in the galaxy where human eyes cannot see it's a spiritual world powerful things are there amazing things are there they have places for children to enjoy their self if your child is in heaven you should not be sad I know you miss them but one day you will be together again for all eternity and God designed fun places for children when they're taken to heaven I'll have best friends and have them look at to do fun things with them I've seen many babies millions of in the nurseries in heaven for many of you if you never had a baby when you get to heaven you actually can adopt a baby and take them back to your mansion and raise them as your own child but little babies who do belong to people when you go to heaven eventually one day when you move there that very same baby will be given to you to raise they'll one day step into their full destiny which is the gift God made them to me and they will not miss it heaven is a place of glory of profoundness there's very profound holy places in heaven amazing places in heaven they also have passionate paradise well people go and worship in the most powerful way with Jesus Christ in these beautiful places there's also whole arts area and heaven called the gallery they they also have fun places like you can use surfing in heaven on 100 foot wave but you can't get hurt the one thing about being in heaven is no one can die okay you died to go there this glorious amazing place which is called the father's house is open to all those who've received Christ as our Savior and when they go home to heaven they have the biggest celebration they've ever had no one who goes to heaven forgets their family they watch over you and declare over you and I know this for sure that every time you have a birthday on this earth they go to this beautiful place called the portable where people can view earth from heaven and they will sing happy birthday to you from heaven they go to these beautiful places in heaven they get you a gift they go put it in your mansion this being built and for every year that you are a part you will have a gift waiting for you when you get to heaven God has great plans for us you know know this earth is very temporal it'll be here for a short time one day it will be like dust but eternity is beyond your imagination it's even more exciting than heaven itself there's going to be so many different places that God will create new and even brand-new places for us to experience we get to be create things and invent things in heaven God is right now while sending waves of the ideas on down to this earth and I promise you even during these days while you were at home make sure you have some kind of a notepad or sketch pad if it's only a spiral notebook he can download witty ideas and inventions not just things you know maybe to help the whole human race these might be places of fun or new products never given on years before I know that because he does that with us here at one quest we get witty ideas and we actually have an idea zone here we have someone you will source that we say has a living idea zone over them because they never stop getting ideas and some of them are fantastic do you know you yourself again remember that you have not because you ask not make sure you're asking God during this time that you actually have spare time make sure you keep a journal of these things he'll tell you he'll show you something sketch it the best you can he may even tell you what it is or what it will do make sure you write those words down because there are FG people in the earth and this earth they can take that and make something from it I have a book of many things that we have not yet made or I've even had time to think about really but usually at the meetings line speaking people will get them so let's just say to say father I asked for and I receive witty ideas and inventions thank you for sending them know if you will say I receive that then you will probably start getting ideas and inventions just make sure you write them down many people get them they never do anything with them and then they will eventually see somewhere else in the earth someone has invented something that you thought about so don't think there's not things you can't do that are productive there are he might show you something new that's not in the earth right now that may may help people all over the world and it might be something simple some of the simplest inventions trying to be the biggest blessings so you as a child of the Living God have the ability built into you to create to invent to sink deeper than people on this earth to even have understanding given to you about the things that God has already said to you if you showed you things you don't understand remember to ask him for more understanding about it and you know that these armies of heaven right now are sent here to protect us that we have the right by the way we're not under angels either God made us a little bit lower than himself not a little bit lower than angels the Bible says and the ages to come we will judge angels that means that we are also over them do you know that when we speak the words of God and send those angels places to bring destruction to the planes of the enemy and to the dark forces that try to overtake us that those armies they will go and do that there's so much I don't have time to share with you tonight you can go to revealing heaven calm and find out some more about this or you can go to Capcom and there's all kinds of Revelation for free on that website is ka t ke RR calm make sure you write that down and remember it there's many things even your children can learn that are on that website many videos of things that I teach and train people in I am NOT here just because I want to say something and I'm not here to make you feel good about something I'm here to train you to do something I want my words to count I want revelation to make a difference in your life but if all you do is hear it and you do nothing with it then that's all it's going to do you need to make a choice if you're going to walk in revelation if you're going to choose to live Revelation then your life will not be the same and I want to encourage you it doesn't matter about your age your education how much money you have or don't have none of those things matter what matters is that you have a in you to want more of God you have a desire to know him warm to do more for him to make a difference in this world you know the Bible says at one point even the night will be light around you again that's that light that you carry inside of you and you may be in a place right now that maybe you don't have light in that home even in the natural begin to declare the things took God over your life over your home and if there are things still working make sure you're declaring that they're going to continue to do that as like I said your words make a difference and I just laughs I lost my ear oh that does not matter okay well then I will not well if he said something to me they better put it back in neighbor you know I actually forget this world is a natural world sometimes and yes I know my hair is pink and no I did not choose that either that was something God asked me to do and actually this is called heaven culture heavens the most exciting beautiful place I've ever been and when people come back from there they will want to be different because of the things that they experienced or saw and I promise you I know many people said I wish I could have color highlights in my hair guess what's coming to the earth not just for a few people but even in society it will be accepted and even in the places you work one day this is going to be normal won't that make it look a whole lot better a boring will be gone one day because so much of God will be in the earth and I'm happy that we believers get to be some of the first people demonstrating that even the kind of clothing we wear designs are going to change fashions are gonna change things that are going to begin to adapt to heaven culture on this earth that's not just something we made up that's a reality man has many different cultures in this world people always want to try to change the culture why not introduce a whole new culture on the earth having culture and begin to live on this earth like they do in heaven fill with Wonder and excitement and joy and you know creativity and have the presence of God and be with you all the time you just need to pursue it okay we're in a race that's what the word says it says you're in a race make sure you get everything out of the way that holds you back any weights any sins any anger any pence don't keep any of it get rid of it out of your life begin to think like God does have expectancy in you when you go to bed at night don't go to the dump go to bed sad or angry remember when God said don't want don't go to bed with anger and you remember that don't let the Sun set down on your anything that means don't take it to bed with you because when you get up in the morning it'll still be there and it may even grow and you make sure you go to bed excited about God's the things of God the thoughts of God in your soul when you go to bed and especially your children declare and let them you say I declare the goodness of God over your life that you're going to be great for him in the search you're gonna have joy and fun and excitement in your life you will grow up Surrey God and loving others I declare wholeness and health and happiness over your life and your child will go to bed filled with those words and when they wake up in the morning they will be excited even though it may not look like that okay teach them that you don't go my things the way they that they look we use our faith we use our faith our faith begins to create things for us and with us you have to have hope in your life if you're going to give it to others if you want to demonstrate the presence of God then you have to be filled with him profane language does not come from heaven that's hell's language so whatever you do don't use that if you get upset loose the anger from you before you even go there okay because the enemy is drawn to things that sound familiar to him so maybe you don't have joy and celebration in your home change what you're saying even if you have to write it on the wall there was a point right here where we're living now I would put signs up everywhere with things that God said like stop being moved and start moving things you know you were born for greatness you weren't born to be below you were born to be above I make these little signs and my mom and come in and I would have taped them all over the walls and then when people would visit us in the past we actually used to have meetings here nobody ever left they would go by and write down the words that were written on these signs all over the wall and they were powerful things heaven is welcome here wanna hang that outside on your door they have shake up some people on it we don't new demons here we believe in Jesus Christ put that on the outside of your door put that on a t-shirt and wear you know the things we should even demonstrate the presence of God and so in this world today all I keep hearing from God even right now is these are days of opportunity and you know yourself and opportunity is something you can take or make happen or just ignore it how about not ignoring it anymore how about getting out there and blinding the enemy with your light and let people hear the things of God come from your mouth even if they have to hear it six feet away even when I go if I go pump gas at the gas station I will be talking about the things of God like everybody wants to hear he's know and guess what people don't leave they'll try to get closer if I'm standing in line anywhere and I'm talking about God people begin to congregate well maybe not right now but but they do normally want to hear these are secular people who don't even know God are you talking about God I thought God was died you know is there a god and then I'm just beginning to talk about his person about heaven about his plans and they are captivated because in those words our hope and truth and his presence so tell me whether you're ten or a hundred you can make a difference and you can choose right now to be different than you ever have before you can leave this meeting that we're having different and begin to operate in those things because it is your right as a believer that you will make supernatural you even got part of God's DNA put on the inside to be you are sons and daughters of the Living God and we may have to live on this earth right now but it says in the Bible even this world is not our home you are not of this world we are the aliens that everybody keeps trying to find and then you know they lived right next door did they because if you're not of this world that makes you an alien then where are you from you are from heaven you're actually a have a nyan that would make a great t-shirt wouldn't it I am a herve nyan where are you from I pray these words are blessing you and God I do speak wholeness and healing to everybody's body god I come against and speak against spirits of infirmity of sickness of any kind of a virus a bacterial viral whatever is I speak against that that we have the right to be over it we are not under it we're not bound to the things of this world but we are bound to heaven and I thank you for sending your healing power Jesus send your healing power out to every person listening or watching let them send it out to other people and impart it to other people I thank you God for this time on the earth even though that may sound strange to you I'm excited that I'm here right now I'm not able to do something to make a difference father I declare and decree that even the stuff in this stores that they have put on the shelves and thought there wasn't much let it multiply overnight let it begin to happen in every city guide I declare over my own City if you don't believe I make sure you declaring these words right our own city I declare that those things will multiply on the shelves they will multiply in my own pantry you had the ability to multiply food to multiply things Christ did that all the time he taught it to the disciples I've actually done that in meetings before where people were eating I would multiply food and when they got done there was so much leftover they didn't know what to do that you have that ability so step up and start saying something okay multiply life the the presence of life and joy in your city speak against doom and gloom and fear don't tolerate them in your city do you know that in this time and we're approaching even now as we learn these things and operate them we begin to bring the glory into our city it begins to invade our city and I do know this in my lifetime we will have regions of light and glory on this earth what does that mean that means in these regions of light and glory sin will not be able to abide sickness will not be able to apply because there's so much of God why is there a lot of God because people are carrying him and releasing him into the atmosphere into the ground I remember when people used to come and they would meet us at the gates of the city at the beginning border of one eye like the south or the north or people would go and stand there and they would ring bells being in declare that but declare the presence of God to come and invade their cities I know people did this here for over well over a hundred years people have been declaring things like that why not add your voice to their voice because God begins to collect our words and then it begins to pour things out that's how an awakening comes that's how a revival comes it's what we're praying and what we're saying our selves into the atmosphere of where we live but there's something coming so powerful that no building and no city will be able to contain it those are the days I like to talk about these are all all the works meetings right now it's just a precursor to the glory days that we will live in right now we're still talking about it but he is beginning to reach release measures of the glory what is the glory it is the presence and the power and the tangible life of God that's what the glory is and how people been crying out you know I've been in so many past revivals and moves of God on the earth and experienced many different things during these moves upon I know I was not a puppy before I was here I'm sure that the OP point of the original outpouring of the Holy Spirit but I've been in many revivals where they had other outpourings of the Holy Spirit I've been here for the river movement you know the fire of God people have been crying off as fire God do you know what the fire of God is I will tell you it is it comes from the very heart of the Father and when it begins to consume you like a blowtorch it comes in fire of God comes in him and burns off the walls of your heart any tragedies any traumas any thoughts of the enemy it literally will burn them away like they were never there it talks about that in the Bible you won't be the same because let me tell you what the fire does it makes you bold in the Word of God in the book of Acts why not read the whole book you've got plenty of time okay the Acts of the Apostles that acts to the people of God that's what that word is interpreted I mean the reason he named books like revelations people say there's no such thing as revelation what about the last book of the Bible it's all about revelations but the acts of man on the earth when they were so filled with Jesus and they received the Holy Spirit flames of fire came so they actually got baptism and fire along with baptism the Holy Spirit in the upper room I've been in the upper room there is still a massive hole in the one the wall with a fire going around where that came in the upper room it's still there in the spirit God marks places I've been do is easy Street there's this massive staircase coming all the way from heaven down into that courtyard right there in Azusa you know the very angels that went up and down during that hole up that whole revival that went on with the zoo the street they are still there waiting to bring more of it back down into that city into the area even over in Kansas where the whole thing started and it was released into the original Bethel when those students were there praying to receive the Holy Spirit and hit that whole school and powerful things begin to happen I actually have a picture of a portal that I took sometimes I show up in the natural and you can see beings I hope this is messing up your mind it should when you hear about God she'd mess up your natural mind with beings looking down through that portal it is the same port of the Holy Spirit came through to bring is over that same school the same school that building is still there I've been there many times I took a picture of the doorknob you know with that precious little black man sat on the stoop to listen to what they were saying about the Holy Spirit there's so much anointing on that doorknob and there's things in the spirit we don't understand but I can tell you what the fire of God will burn fear out of you it says that there's a day coming where it says in the Bible that he came to bring us the Holy Spirit and to a baptizes in the Holy Spirit and with fire that fire is a whole new level of God and that fire will go to you it will burn things off the wall of your heart and the spirit it will see you with boldness because those people in the book of Acts these apostles these people were hiding they were hiding because it was after Jesus was crucified and they were looking for these people don't to take them out and yet when they got filled with the Holy Spirit and with fire they went into the streets began to preach miracles happen they were bold what made them bold that fire God that's what it does you I've never been the same I've had a measure in the fire of God that's exactly what happened to me and that is still coming to this earth Eagle pour out on everywhere that fire will burn inside of people on top of buildings people will even physically begin to see that fire that's something you should be talking about looking forward to that hasn't happen another thing I know and I'm agree with any profits that will say this that the wealth is coming to the body of Christ and it's right on the ending when this thing begins to end and it will pass this virus it will pass social distancing it will pass it will be a thing of the past but there is going to be downloads of wealth and revelation giving to people who are faithful who didn't abandon Christ who reached out to help others to be that living example what is coming to you should make you so excited because those days are upon us when we will be able to be great for him and I know the wealth of God is beyond your imagination I have seen heaven God is not poor do you know I told you what he's drawn dude your compassion for others you helping others you serving to make a difference in this world you declaring and decree the things of God you wearing the anointing and using it so much it makes a cloud around you you know the Bible talked about Peter when he would walk past people it said his shadow healed people it was not his human shadow it was the cloud of anointing that came from his very being and he released so much it grew outside of him and when he would walk by people that anointing that kind of anointing would sweep over them and that anointing broke the yoke of darkness and healing came and hope came to people so in this day of being great for him I will not discuss doom and gloom with anybody doom and gloom and those days are far from us and maybe you think that's what this is because you never experienced anything like take advantage take the opportunity to make a difference in this time this time will not be here much longer but you will be here until God decides to take you home so if you want to be different if you want to be on fire for him if you want to manifest and demonstrate for him that's something else that has not happened it talks about in the Bible that's a manifested sons and daughters will walk on this earth they'll speak to the land the sea in the air they will make things happen that never happened before they'll be doing amazing signs and wonders the earth is in travail right now it is shaking it is shaky why it wants to manifest and sons and daughters to get up and demonstrate the power of the Living God that has not happened and the greater works without them Christ talked about he said all the things I did you can do you will do also and greater things than even what he did he said himself we as the body of Christ wees believers will do those things that means that at one point some run this earth at a Funeral someone will raise someone from the dead that was cremated yes he did show me that so many will stop a whole earthquake and make it put it back the way it was before it even came that is what is in you that's what's inside of you those things of greatness those things of God the power of the Living God you are his child you don't belong to man you don't belong to the enemy and yet in this time he is asking us and he has firstly said to me I do not want the body of Christ to be at war with the government and this time we are to work together God chose our president he wants goodness for us he really does he wants us to work together with him so as much as possible what you're being asked to do please do it and do it with joy and do it with celebration don't let people see you grumble and complain because you're being asked to do something they will help this virus to go faster is they have a plan that they to put out there and and I am in contact with some people who are in the government I can't give anybody's names but I can tell you the plans that they have and a lot person Trump wants for us he is how god this how God explains him he's an all-american boy who was all for America this is not about these are words from God himself this is not going to be an overthrow by the government but this is an a takedown of the virus that is crippling people and interfering with people's lives all over this world God said this is not something to take it down so instead of arguing with your friends or complaining and grumbling about things that you don't have and you don't like that you're being asked to do I remind you everyone is being asked to do the same thing whether the rich but their middle income whether they're poor or all this time being asked to do the same thing so why not work together why not help what the government is asking us to do thank God there are many Christians now stepping out you know offering to help ministries are offering to help businesses are offering to help it makes me think about heaven because everybody cares for one another so in this time why not have a memory of the opportunities you took to make a difference and see God move on our behalf I promise you God has touched this country with his hand and I know there's other countries around this world and he loves them too but he is making America a pattern a pattern of his life in the way he lives for other countries to run after and he has talked to me about shifting government leaders so he can shape those nations and I know one for sure that God is after is North Korea he's totally after North Korea and there will be one Korea at one time don't be South Korean North Korea God was moving in the area right now and just since this all started did you know that the president of Brazil has been born again and they just had another who was the other one Jen that was just born again El Salvador is that right the president and leader of El Salvador just gave his life to Jesus Christ why not that could be another whole focus you and your family could pray declared that God will shift the leaders of nations why not pick a couple nations begin to declare over the very leaders of those nations that they would feel God move on them that they would be shifted to know Jesus Christ and then that whole nation will begin to be shaped by God these are things you can even teach your children how to do you and your wife you know or your best friend get involved you know those that you are allowed to see and be with why not focus on the things God's into you God right now is definitely shifting leaders of governments and then beginning to shape those nations you'll see El Salvador and you will see Brazil so impacted now by the head of those nations given herself to God he will begin to change and shift many things in those nations and he's only begun this is something that's just beginning this is not something that's going to end that's why things aren't going in these are times are we starting things for the first time and we're all experiencing actually for the first time in this world the majority of nations are coming together maybe in different ways to end this virus and they're seeking help and many of them are even asking for prayer so how can we hope that prayer we are blessed in this nation this is just a short time that we're going through now but you yourself can impact the spirit realm around you and what impacts the spirit realm impacts the physical realm so I I have very much enjoyed sharing this with you I hope you're going to be changed forever make sure you get the Word of God begin to declare it teach it to your children I will tell you that I am one of 15 if you've seen Jen my sister who has blue hair why not have fun right in this world she's a children's author and she's the baby my dad call her the caboose on his train and one thing my dad was very good at was he taught us to pray from the time we could barely stand he taught us to love people to help people that's just in us so when I see others I see their needs I care about what they need I consider others more highly than myself why I'm just like my earthly dad I love to take my own stuff and give it away we grew up in a time when my dad would take food off of our stove and take you to people who are in need and didn't have any food and we would pray he'd have us set the table this is the truth my if my mom was still up she being here right now speaking with me but my mom is the witness of all this she's about to be 89 so you know if you all know us give a shout-out to my mom GG for her upcoming birthday by the way she's doing great but she is she's a living testimony of the power of God and the love of God and the miracles we had in our family that even though we gave away our food and our clothes and our furniture we got so much more given to us and we would set our table and hold our hands and my dad would bless the food that wasn't even there and there'd be a knock at the door and people would bring food in already cooked it is too late to tell me that God doesn't care it is too late to tell me those things aren't true it's too late to tell me that it doesn't happen he is no respecter of person so what are you saying what is in the layers of your soul are they filled with the life of God and the love of God where about your words they carry life and hope and I want you to know that when you speak to people who are not believers even if they're screaming and yelling you do you know the light from you will go in their spirit and in their soul and pierce the darkness that is there if you only could see in the spirit what you are producing every day in your life so what are you leaving with people is that the darkness or is it the light of God because we are light in this world God is light everything heaven is made out of light okay there's no darkness in heaven there's no turning or changing of God in his heart with darkness he is so filled with light in love and we are made in His image so take these days that are being given to us in this time as a believer as the body of Christ it is your commission to be like God act like God speak like God and declare and create things that will change stuff in this world I hope you don't forget this that you were born your birth was timed on this earth you are not a mistake it doesn't even matter how your birth happened if you didn't have good parents God the Father is your father you lived in him we all did before he sent us to this earth he timed your birth on use to be here for these things not so you could have challenging days not so that you could be harmed not so that you could lose your job or not I have food or be angry or v-up so he didn't put you here for that he expects you to say things and make it change that's what he's watching right now he's watching to see how many of us are bold enough and deal with him enough that we will open our mouth and make a difference open your front door I don't know what time it is right now he's probably late but for me I'm wide awake why because I'll probably go to bed at 7 a.m. what do I do I go up the middle of my street and walk up down and declare the things of God over my city over my government even over the whole world why not it can be you too I wasn't made here I wasn't put here just because he says I look good in pink hair I was put here because he knew I would be bold enough regardless of what anyone else is saying to say what he wants and who we are and what his plans are and you we'll put here to be great for him not to play in the camp of the enemy not to run after darkness not the sound like hell or act like them you're supposed to be crushing them and pushing them back because God is about to invade this world and turn us upside down fill us with a fire of God the light of God walking in the lightning power of God like John G Lake did lightning comes out of you did you know that when you release it and impart it into others I am part the Lightning power of God and everyone listening to destroy every worth of darkness against them every sickness in their body all fear all lack all unforgiveness all offense but the lightning power of God zap BAM and get the enemy out of your life and out of your home open your front door and say that and see if things don't change in your own life but if you sit there and do nothing guess what you're gonna have nothing and if you wobble back and forth sit you flip-flop and one day you're full of hoping they sense something happens you see something on Facebook and all of a sudden the whole world's ending and now you're going over here a double-minded man will receive nothing of the Lord so make a stand and don't be moved but begin to move things in this world for him and heaven will record it all and one day you'll get to see it in glory the difference you made and then what happened your children after you that they become greater because you begin to fill them with things they probably never heard you talk about you cannot tell me these things I'm a sharing or two deep because I have grandchildren that are three and five and eight and they all operating these things of God they know the difference between the darkness and the light they know what the healing power of God they will prophesy view you need you tell your children these things I remember when I was four and I asked Jesus in my heart I saw him step inside of me I was so changed when I was 4 years old and I liked it so much I did it again next year so at the age of five I got born again again and it was just as awesome I'm sure Jesus thought that was quite humorous and if you don't know him he is a character and when he walked this earth he was the biggest character on this earth I would tell people there's a whole part of heaven have nothing a space for characters Elijah's one of them I can tell you that for sure King David is also a quite a character these people are still alive they're living in heaven when your loved one leaves this earth they are not dead their body might be and under the day the dead in Christ shall rise their body will be brought back to life and their spiritual body who's living in heaven will be brought back together and they will be made immortal for all eternity nothing is worth missing heaven and knowing God make that your priority on your list and love if you're if you're married you husband and wives you love your wife husband and wife you love your husband because that gives them fuel to live by and if there is no love then you all are running on empty so god I declare that you will speak to the heart of everyone that is point joined together in marriage as husband and wife God that they will love one another and love will flood their home into their family into the destiny God and I accelerate them for this wonderful time on the earth to make a difference right now in this opportune time that you have declared for a time of opportunity and your wife and your colony be seen around this earth and that bless you all and the name

Kat Kerr's NEWEST Revelation About Heaven - PART 2
by Антон Бодровский tv Apr 22, 2021

or https://youtu.be/o-JlLvgGoFA
[Music] did you know if you walk sideways going upstairs you will never fall my workout and the gym on the treadmill oh i blow their minds i walk sideways i walk backwards i can go frontwards and backwards at the same time and of course they don't know what to think of me anyway when i signed up with my pink hair but you know when they realized i wasn't going to fall off and get hurt they leave me alone but everyone who comes in there they try to stare without staring you know and later i might demonstrate walking backwards very quickly and one of the reasons why he's having me do this is uh i'm getting trained by the holy spirit to learn to do some of the things that christ did on the earth how did he step into that realm and walk through the people and not be seen he wasn't hidden by people and he didn't walk around the people he walked through the because people spirit realm supersedes this physical realm and that's why spiritual beings can pass through these physical walls there's a reason for that it's the original realm that god created and jesus was trained and taught by his father how to make a one step whether it was sideways or backwards and when he did that he'd be in a whole different place that was unseen by everybody because there's a rip there's rifts all over in the spirit realm sometimes they look like slits some are portals some just doors open and you step in there's all kinds of ways to enter into the spirit realm it'll be one of the things that i not that i'm going to teach you how to literally do that but you'll know the purpose for learning that and god is totally preparing us to rule and reign in that place that's where our authority is it's over all of the the demonic darkness and it's in the spirit realm the way that we take our authority say amen say i receive it so i've been learning a lot this last almost two years he's i've not traveled very much people bombard me i have over 100 invitations waiting for me but god has said you're not going yet unless he specifically says i can so this was definitely a divine appointment if i'm here it's because god wanted me here for a reason and you're here because he wanted you here for a reason and if you're watching online he wanted you here for a reason amen so this is a time for divine appointments for destinies to be fulfilled and i would be talking in just a little bit about charting your course through the spirit realm so you're going to get a little bit of the spirit round but the boot camp is going to be something special i've only done it one other time that was at my own meeting every year i have a heavens invitation in my own city and i can do it all my way it's wild it's wonderful it's filled with a lot of glitter and uh amazing crazy things go on in those meetings okay because i totally live heaven culture heaven culture is holy but fun and if people thought you know you have to live holy to be a be a part of heaven well you can't be a part if you aren't having fun [Music] 50 of all of heaven is about having fun so if you ever wondered if you'd be bored the answer is no holy profound amazing splendor wonder uh just unspeakable glory his presence never leaves you because you're living in it it's in the walls of your mansion it's on the streets of gold you walk on you uh travel in so many ways in heaven it's a spiritual world but you live a literal life in your spiritual body you're not little wisps of something that floats around he wouldn't give you a crown he wouldn't give you clothing he wouldn't give you a mansion that actually has amazing furniture that can shape shift and uh you travel even in portals through your home you can see all kinds of things going on step through the door and be in outer space this is heaven i'm talking about the heaven that belongs to your daddy the god of the bible well i've never seen any other god there okay the god of the bible owns this heaven i'm talking about and you only get there through jesus christ there's people that think you can go without jesus you will be disappointed because you won't go there you go to another spiritual abode that you will not like nor enjoy nor ever have fun okay you can either exist to live or exist to die where do you want to go i'm going to go where you exist to live so i heaven's always going to sneak in there somehow when i'm talking because i have a commission i know many people are caught up to heaven and people go why do you see so much you know why you're taking so many places because i actually have a commission given to me by the living god this is your commission we're going to take you to heaven nonstop i've gone almost every day for the last 20 years sometimes more than once a day on purpose showing me things amazing things fun things profound things i know how having operates i know what the food looks like smells like taste like i know what your clothing in your wardrobe rooms look like i know what your crown roam crown room looks like in your mansion i know how your pets live up there i know uh all the many different places to see and i've only seen a little dot i could name literal places in heaven i've been taken to you i've seen many of the disciples apostles prophets and uh none of the people i would say the natural people of earth don't ever see me when i'm there he hides me on purpose because they would be chasing me down the streets of gold giving me all of your names and phone numbers and telling me to look you up and please tell them that i love them because people on this earth always ask me i know you can't do this but when you go up there here's my family member's name this is what they'll look like please tell them i love them they are no different than you are they all want you to know they love you they have not forgotten you if you had any kind of quarrel before they died let it go because they don't even remember it do not waste your life for 20 years grieving over the fact that you had an argument with them they don't even remember it anymore but the enemy will remind you if you let him and they got great plans for you they're making plans to take you places and events that go on in heaven and you're never going to get rid of them you'll never get rid of your family amen even the ones you wish lived on the other side of the world we live right next door to you in heaven so right now if you've got family members you don't like get restoration with them because if they make it to heaven you will be living right next door and that neighbor down the street that drives you wild get him born again he'll also live right next door to you because if you think god doesn't have a sense of humor just wait you get to heaven and you don't have to wait to get to heaven this habitation this move of god that's about to happen isn't just another revival it is a habitation that will last for generations no matter what time you think it is i've seen god's timeline and this this habitation of god will last for generations nobody living on this earth right now of course unless they live for hundreds of years and that's a possibility nobody on the earth right now will be here during the perilous times say i receive it there's no time for the perilous times right now there's absolutely no time for that because god is coming he's going to show up and show off in us to take back this earth to bring restoration to the very land sea and air itself amen to bring mass restoration to your families to your friends even restoration in the nations i saw happen during this this move of god millions of those that you have been judging and speaking against race into the kingdom no matter what you thought god's not going to you know send fire from heaven burn them up and take them to hell they make some of the best witnesses some of the worst sinners make the best witnesses for god on the earth okay and that probably embarrasses all the way they worship god and so i can tell you get ready for change and get ready for strange and i have known god for a very long time i've known jesus from the age of four got saved twice in my life once at four and once at five and i can tell the people who are in the flesh because they're the ones who write me and say i believed everything you said until book two and you made an error on the back you said you got saved at five and it said four on the first book so now i don't believe you i went you need prayer you need serious prayer if that one little thing bothered you you don't want to miss out on everything god has for you so i'm going to act like you didn't say it because if you don't hold it against him he won't either get a clue if you don't get offended don't hold those things against people god won't hurt him against either and then he can sick them with the holy ghost amen you need to learn to give backlash to the enemy and stop worrying about backlash and the only one having a crisis will be the isis they're about to lose all the power of satan that they they've been given and been controlled with and used with because we're about to strip it all away and we'll actually do that in the meeting tonight before we leave and we will sip the host of heaven on all those demonic beings and strip away the power and dismantle the platforms that that satan has been ruling with in that terrorist group so yes you can do something with your little old self if you're born again have god's dna the power of the holy ghost the host of heaven working on your side there is not one thing the enemy has that can stand in your way say i receive it i've seen all of this take place in the future that is right now whether you know it or not you're already in the future when you learn to step into that place in the spirit realm and you live from the future the power and the glory of the age to come will overwhelm you and that's where you will live from that place for your supply for demonstrating for god to walk an absolute love of god towards anybody doesn't matter who it is and see them through god's eyes that's smart everybody say i receive it that needs to be on your lips through this whole meeting tonight because he will write it down you give permission and uh most of the time god needs your permission to do things but one thing he doesn't need anybody's permission for is he's about to touch all flesh on this earth without invitation or without permission it's in the word of god everything i've been saying is in the word of god i give you power over all the power of the enemy and nothing by any means shall harm you that's where we're going that's where god has us heading that there'll be a time when the body of christ who is racing after what he wants his will his way will live and never be attacked by the enemy instead the enemy will flee from them there's other prophets who are already in glory saying yes because they're all watching this meeting right now anything that has to do with this time on the earth and you know the times and seasons of god and that's what you race after you abandon dump and ignore the doom and gloom reports because those are the enemies plans they're all the enemy's plans and god's been revealing to his leaders the enemy's plans and because he reveals what they've been asking for they think it's god who's going to do it that's a whole different way to interpret those things and i happen to know that they're saying god please reveal the plains of the enemy revealed the plains of the enemy they've been doing it for generations and now he's doing it and because he's doing it they think it's him that's going to do it and he's up there saying why do they not get it they've been asked he actually said that to me they've been asking me to reveal the plans of the enemy and i'm doing another saying it's my plans he said my plan is to prosper my plan is to empower my plan is to have ruling and reigning in the body of christ demonstrating and manifesting handling the wealth for all those are prepared to do that to help change this world take the atmosphere and the land back for my kingdom he said i cannot destroy and bring wrath at the same time that is for another time on the earth say i receive it so you're listening living right now in the best of times unless you're still here 50 60 70 years from now when our our children and great grandchildren our great great grandchildren are casting the mountains in the sea that'd be pretty cool to see but we have to step out first you know he has to have those who are brave enough and bold enough to step into the time on his timeline and do it his way and his will using the power and authority jesus gave us kick fear out of your life because that all belongs to the devil and run after what god wants we have to start something so they have something to follow after on the foundation of this new whole thing that god is setting up is going to be new it's going to be powerful and it will be strange the father gave me the a very powerful revelation caught me up to heaven uh just a day or so before i came here and said there's something new i want you to give to the body of christ so they understand the word where i say my ways are not your ways and my thoughts are not my thoughts and it's not because i'm so high and mighty that you can't ever get them it's just that they want to put me in their mind and their understanding and my ways are strange and my thoughts are strange because i am strange there are strange things in heaven there's always been strange things in the word that he had people do and this is going to be a strange wonderfully strange time on the earth so get it in your head it will not be normal if heaven if this is all about bringing heaven to earth and the kingdom of heaven being released and seen on the earth in our lives and it will not be normal everybody say it it will not be normal i do not look normal and i am heaven culture i have no fear everything i have belongs to god and no matter how much money he sends to me this is what he says to me i will give you unlimited money because the way you live this is how i have to live he said if i send it i spend it if you can get that in your soul and in your plans no matter what he sends if he sends it he that's it bottom line as far as the finances and the wealth is concerned it's okay to get whatever you need he doesn't mind you being blessed and he also told me this things i did in the past where the world didn't see what was going on i will openly let the world see you prosper above the world have more than the devil be known in the world like never before he said some people will become famous in the world because of the power my power they carrying display for me using everything i've put in them to be them you have to be you because he picked you he didn't pick your neighbor your sister your brother your aunt your uncle he picked you for right now so don't try to be like anyone else except jesus i don't want to be anyone else i like me you have to like yourself if you don't like you how are the people going to like you say i like myself please god forgive me when i spoke against myself in any way at any time i am going to start liking me you like me you chose me i'm perfect for what you need me to do so here i am send me now get up in the morning and start saying that in your mirror instead of what you've usually said and ignore all the things other people say you don't have to receive anything anybody says against you that's not what god says bottom line they're not going to save you they're not taking you to heaven or letting you live forever i get strange looks when i say you might not die were there people in the bible who did not die this is a new time on the earth and god's going to do spectacular strange things what if he wants you to be here for 500 years are you going to say no trust me if you if you're willing to stay and he wants you to stay you will stay he will not even let me think about leaving he never discusses my end he said you will stay here until i'm done with you no matter how long that is and how would you like the lord of glory to walk through your home sit on your love seat put his arm around you say this is all the things we're going to do with you for like the next 30 years in great detail show you what if that's why i've been so patient about being revealed because i've been hidden and now i'm about to be revealed and released don't bother praying for those who want to kill me because one of the things he said to me he said the world will love you our people will like you you see the difference the world will fall in love with you because you will bring hope for them for a future and hope that there is a god who does love them and i loved it for the first time i will release this and hope that it just bashes some religious spirits he said that we would be some of the biggest the biggest santa claus this world saw [Applause] he is not threatened by santa claus he personally knows saint nick who is living in heaven at this very moment giving out gifts to children in christmas town [Applause] who made snow who made the trees who made the stars if he wants to put him together in a place in heaven and call it christmas town who can argue against him i was taken there and you can go through sleigh rides through the air and you can ice skate all the time and the snow never melts and sometimes it's in color [Music] and whatever you build out of that snow comes to life you've heard me if you watch my videos if you haven't god help you uh how many people have never heard of me before can i see your hand well i prayed for you already because i do know god i don't know about him i know him he owns me he owns my life my past my future my eternity i came from him i was sent by him i speak for him and i live for him i choose to be holy and i do not sin if you think you can't go through this earth and not sinned and you have not been reading the word of god because he's coming for a bride without sin or your flesh showing up so how about that people say you can't live sinless and what then the word's not true because he's coming for a bride that doesn't sin i'm starting early i'm an example this is where you need to be every word that comes out of your lot of your mouth is life it's not that hard after you train yourself it's not it's actually fun because you're hurting the enemy and you're terrorizing the demonic i'm adding to my resume tormentor of demons [Applause] because we get to do that when the demons ask jesus are you here to torment us before our time and he said no because he gave us that job [Music] everybody say i receive it see this is a different life we're going to learn to live heaven culture and if you didn't know what there's no fear in heaven there's no hate in heaven there's certainly no sin in heaven there is fun in heaven there's creativity in heaven there's life in heaven their body might be dead of course except enoch and elijah their body never died they look pretty good they look better than all of us everybody in heaven looks better than you even your 100 year old grandma looks like she's in her 20s nobody is old even the eternal ones the ancient ones who are there the elders who by the way are not the leaders of the twelve tribes of israel and they are not the twelve disciples because when john saw them he did not see himself they're ancient eternal beings whose face look young but their eyes are ancient and eternal and they're all out in heaven trying to serve you [Music] the greatest of all will be the servant of all and even they and the apostles and the prophets in heaven will come to your mansion trying to find some way to serve you it's how heaven culture is heaven culture is a culture of unquestioned honor honor needs to come to the body of christ because if you're going to live heaven culture and have life on earth as it is in heaven then you need to learn about honor amen you need to understand that we are a family no matter what color your skin is where you are where you live where you came from what your heritage is your ancestry you came from god that's your heritage and that and revelation is being poured into this earth so you can chart your course according to god's timeline and live heaven culture in this earth using your amazing natural gifts that god put in you because you're practicing for heaven and heaven they don't need intercessors they do have an intercessory room where people go do warfare in the supernatural and see what happens on the earth they're agreeing with those who are who are interceding on the earth you have someone partnering with you in the intercessory room in heaven partnering with you every time you intercede on the earth so you're not alone even if you think you're alone and every time you say father when you're praying you're in the spirit in front of his throne he told me that years ago he said every time you prayed father i was right there i was there my throne was there i heard everything you said i wrote it down there's a hall of intercessors where your face will be emblazoned in this supernatural bronze copper i don't even know what it is looks like liquid but it's still a substance and you can go in this hall of intercessors they're called the hull the superheroes because that's what we are we're superheroes on the earth for heaven amen it's okay to say that say we are the superheroes of heaven we are when you pray on this earth for people you become a superhero in the spirit realm because you're releasing something that the host can take in war with against the enemy you are powerful that's why the enemy is afraid of you that's why he attacks you and tries to steal from you but i can tell you even that is going to change for those who choose to rule which is another thing you need to put on your chart you chart your course you're right at the top rule and reign with jesus christ every believer has the right to do that if they choose it you have to choose it you chose christ you invited christ you chose the holy spirit you invited the holy spirit you choose to rule and reign and then you let them do what they want to with you and you invite the host of heaven to be a part of your team is quiet what do you think they're doing in heaven they're not warring millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions i've seen michael's headquarters on the far side of heaven go to isaiah 13 and see what it says that the captain of the hosts went to the far ends of heaven to gather the army to fight on behalf of god's people i didn't even know that scripture was in there but i had been to michael's headquarters it's on the opposite side of heaven as a throne room and all the glorious city of god which is massive you can't see the end of it it's on the opposite side of heaven it's not a tourist attraction because they're always having maneuvers being sent out on assignment in mass to come deserved of war on behalf of believers and now in this time when you choose to rule and you go with god's protocol according to what the word says following what the word says and understand who you are then you get a part of the army assigned to you you better receive it because they are now one of our weapons and they literally fight and pull down strongholds we were not designed to fight we do not physically fight with a spiritual army of darkness but they do and they do it really well and when they have us on their side cheering them on then they're even more fierce and it releases power to them because we're the ones that have the authority on this earth it's about time we took it [Applause] so this habitation of heaven on this earth will you'll see so many demonstrations of the host of heaven manifesting openly before the eyes of even the unsaved dealing with the enemy when we pray and we speak and they'll see it happen they will be bringing they will assist the the courier angels will be bringing the millions of body parts down to empty the body parts warehouse in heaven the hosts will be assisting them and bringing with those angels they always bring come with the other angels to war for them that's their job gabriel's group has a job and michael's group has a job and they work really well together unless he sends a comedian and a really holy angel i say holy mind dead they're like us they have serious ones they have hilarious ones i'm sure they all probably love dog edison the comedy group probably love him they're all probably with him right there on the platform just egging them on i found with angels their name depicts their uh position or their assignment and the way they're created is in tribes this is still all stuff you need to chart your course with you need to understand who is going on that course with you okay you're not going alone you won't ever be alone earlier today i said you can't leave your spouse behind and it got real quiet when i said that i haven't left my spouse behind even though he's not here with me physically he's a part of me he's the number one person i'm accountable with towards god when you get to heaven i said this this morning god will not ask you how many nations did you take how many souls did you win he will say what did you do with your spouse and if heaven interviewed them right now what would they say i want my husband to say she made me happy she let me have a good time and go fishing when i wanted to and she put up with the smelly shrimp and the dead fish bodies dead fish bodies in my freezer next to my ice cream taking her out to fish on the side of the pier and the chips would blow on the where all the birds pooped on the dock and let me pick them up and eat them not me but i finally just let him do what he wanted to he could live off the land and enjoy every minute of it but i let him be him and then i make him feel important and all the i'm out there in the public eye and soon in the world's eye my husband will still be the number one most important thing in my life besides jesus and need to make sure they feel that way so when you chart your course don't forget to include them somehow they're that you're covering they're there to love you cover and protect the treasure god put in you to be your greatest intercessor your spouse is your greatest intercessor if they're not there yet then love them until they are amen as long as they're they are loving god as long as they're loving you and they want to be with you okay and they're not out there committing crimes and sinning everywhere or beating you and i'm just going to throw this in there for free if they are dump them you better say yes because god didn't say to submit to someone who's abusing you there's nowhere in the world that says submit to them even though they're abusing you you have a right to be protected and safe god gave us our husbands to love cover and protect us our job is to honor them love them and serve them remember that help thing man needs help and they are not going to make it without us women and don't even try you needed your mama and now you need us because you can't find nothing most of the time you can't cook anything and you cannot change babies diapers [Applause] if you can you get a gold medal my husband rather go to war than change a baby's diaper i know you're listening babe but you know that's true we need each other and when god made him he looks around he goes man i forgot something because he sure is going to need help and then he made us and we weren't made from dirt that's why we're prettier than you [Laughter] well you're supposed to spoil us okay you did not have to birth the babies and no matter what you think you've been through in your life there is nothing almost as hard as doing that you should be blessed that god didn't ask you say i receive it all amen you just have to help take care of him and help feed him okay you helped to bring in the supply but he did not ask you to carry that uh that that baby inside you for nine months and you're you you talk about shape-shifting that is the most supernatural shape-shifting that's happened on this physical planet is what happens to our body when we have to carry a baby and if it's twins or triplets you better be tweeting your treating your wife like a queen this is all truth isn't it so if your family has been with you all this time when it gets time for you to step out and do what god does has you to do make sure you impart every bit of that to your family so the next generation coming behind you can walk and run on the same platform that you laid for them we all need help and i can tell you one thing i haven't even started yet we all are going to need each other more now in this time than ever before we still have to have accountability even when you rule and reign you have to have accountability it's wise to have counsel it's wise to understand the things of the spirit this world is on a slide an accelerated slide into the spirit realm on both sides it will be visibly seen and people will one day live in an area because of the spirit they believe in will be ruling there they'll put their kids in the school that will promote the spirit that they're following or the god that they're following in public schools the world is changing and it's happening rapidly but god still has a plan and we're on his side say amen so i'll wait i need to do we take up the offering already well i'm going to give away some stuff first okay because i get to do that tonight and so if you missed joan's stuff i have some stuff up here i have uh something that's uh profound something that's exciting something that's going to be empowering you and i have something delicious because if i go somewhere i'm gonna start carrying sweets with me if you did not know jesus has a sweet tooth blame it on him he grew up eating honeycomb almost every day of his life it was it ran in the family because his cousin john remember him even though he was out in the desert in the wilderness he had a full supply of everybody say it loud honey was a dessert back in those days it was a delectable delicious thing that was put in all kinds of desserts and they loved it they didn't necessarily have sugar probably better off that they didn't have it but they had honey they put it in everything to sweeten everything they made desserts out of it it was something that uh and wealthy people had a lot of it okay it was but at celebrations everybody got a little bit of honey and if you will notice people argue that they don't eat in heaven what do you think they do down here there's something called feasts say they eat at feasts on earth they eat it feast in heaven and when we get there one day it'll be the biggest feast ever because we'll be going to the marriage supper of the lamb and there'll be lots of dessert [Applause] so i tell people blame your sweet tooth on jesus and seriously he hangs out at the bakeries in heaven because when somebody new comes that's a baker he's going to be there to test their stuff and it's all free and there's no weight gain and no food allergies amen that's one of the reasons they call it heaven [Music] well i'm claiming that for heaven coming to earth if that's true then we're going to claim that none of those calories are going to affect us amen well truly i will just oh i will go ahead and start with this in a minute but god really is um not necessarily at this time asked me to do a lot of daniel fast and i know a lot of people probably i'm on right now it's amazing that you set your life aside in your normal eating habits but this is what he would rather see that you need to get your life in order where you're eating well but healthy and make sure you eat in moderation especially things that aren't healthy i am preaching it because he wants me to he needs you in good shape for this race especially if you're going to be here a long time [Music] start cutting your portions in half put less in your body you can have less on your body so if we put less in our body we'll have less on our body [Music] there's little ways you can start okay as part of charting your course make sure you've got the right food supply with you in your cabinets and your refrigerator and your body eat in moderation and yes i love bacon i don't eat it every day okay but i do like it he can resist that smell they have bacon in heaven but they don't get it from pigs but the pigs are there if they're your pets i love talking about heaven because you know there's no standard that you can sit there and judge me with you haven't been there been there done that tasted the ice cream tasted the pizza have seen clothing changing colors rode on worship saw rainbow bridges go all the way across the crystal sea so you could walk over to the other side seeing the dolphins and the whales come up out of the water along you ride these big sail ships and it does talk about them in the word great sail ships that the holy spirit blows in the sails and they go across the crystal sea where rainbows shoot out of the crystal sea everywhere and when you do that the all of the sea creatures will come up and begin to worship god literally singing worship to god and those on the boats who begin to worship with him and the glory falls on the whole thing you're engulfed and consumed in waves of glory in you even in heaven and your families living there amen we've got to start changing many things in our life and care about ourselves okay care about yourself care about your family there's yummy healthy things out there and i have news for you god's gonna make uh create inventions on the earth we'll process things in a safe healthy way that we won't have to use some of the stuff that's being done now amen read your labels make sure you know where something's made seriously i've spent the last year reading oh every label in the stores want to go in the stores to see what's in things and some of it you wouldn't want amen i'm glad god's going to give believers of many new ideas and i'll let you know that these organic farms are about to explode so the healthier things and the more they make the prices will come down some because it'll be more of an abundance because people are demanding them and i know that 30 some year old generation doesn't want anything unless it's organic some of my children are in that age and they don't want anything unless it's organic because it's healthier amen and so there's just you know i like to give life tips to people i live and move in the supernatural but i also live on this earth part of the time and i like natural things amen so right now i'm going to give some things away so i need my helper everybody say woohoo [Applause] the army over top of us just said that so i have some things to give away i'm gonna start with these dream stickers god's dream and i have got so much 20 years of revelation but some things god just wants you to know about and uh this symbol which i'm sure you will recognize right here if i can get ahold of it right here is not just a symbol of the jews this is god's personal sign and symbol his personal it's all over heaven i before i knew that it was his i would go there and come back and say well god really loves the jewish people and yes he does love the jewish people because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have anything regret they were grafted in we don't replace them we've become a part of them they heard god first and follow god first and obeyed god first right when it was really not easy back in those days and so this is what the father did he caught me up before his throne and he said i'm because he knew what was saying that he listens to me hello i mean he sends me he listens to me and if i need a little correcting he does it right away and so he caught me up i had just said that in a in a meeting god loves the jewish people those symbols are everywhere in heaven i've even seen whole squadrons of angels that's on their gowns and i want i guess they're there to be sent to help israel but but i know god really loves them and he caught me up to stone he goes you are correct that i love them because i named them and called them for myself he said however as far as this symbol is concerned and right then it appeared in front of the throne a huge one i could see it very clearly he said this is not just the sign and symbol of the jewish people he said if you were going to raise up a people and call them your own and give them a symbol whose symbol would you give them and i don't usually answer him when i'm standing there because i'm like i wasn't quite sure i wanted to say well i would give them my own if they were going to be my people but he answered me he said i gave them my own sign and symbol because they would represent me in the earth i would have somebody a nation that actually i had called them and chosen them and they said yes some of them many of them and he said so i gave them my own personal sign and symbol he said this symbol represents my dream and in front of me this star separated into two different triangles one pointing up and one pointing down and he moved one aside and the one that pointed up he said this represents father son and holy spirit and then moved it to the side and brought the other one in and he said this represents body soul and spirit it represents man and then all of a sudden they went together and he said this is and always has been my dream man and us together as one and so we made it we created this symbol and a friend of mine made these stickers for us we we only sell them for a dollar it's about what it costs us to make them because he's really made in america high quality stuff and it's a sticker you can put it on anything on your car on anything it won't come off i guess you could eventually get off your car and it says god and man as one forever and actually says uh father son and holy spirit and it says body soul and spirit on these two triangles just like he showed me whatever he reveals to me i reveal to you and an orthodox jew by the way they do listen to me also on youtube because they know that i love the same god that they love and when i i have the summer on youtube i'm talking about it and one of them contacted me and said i want you to know that this symbol became even more precious to me when you explained that this belonged to he didn't say god he called him ill or elohim he said it belongs to him it's his own and he gave it to us and he said i will now forever cherish it even more than i did before so we have a we have five of these to give away i think there's five in here we're going to give these away and so this is god's personal sign and symbol and um i guess you're going to have to pick five people whoever yells right now god wait shall i tell you [Applause] i want you to yell god's dream [Applause] and and by the way [Music] i i will also i'll be giving those away everybody who comes to spirit around boot camp will get one in their packet along with something else our spirit round boot camp um we're going to have our camo it's going to be made out of eyes from the living creature figure if duck dynasty can do it with feathers we can do it with the living creature there's a whole tribe of angels that see and they're the cherubim and they have eyes all over in their bodies and the living creatures of course are there before the throne and the next thing i have is a declaration card i'm going to have to try to do i don't want to take all night okay um there's all of these are revelations god gave me and these are very simple things that if you will apply them to your life it will change your life starting tonight and they're simple because most of god's things he gives us or asks us to do they're simple and i noticed that when he speaks to me he talks to me like an eight-year-old child i have become so child like it's almost ridiculous i used to be a really nice business person who wore the three-piece beautiful business suits all the time i worked in legal uh atmospheres in interior design i've worked in um the insurance commercial industry and i can't even speak anymore in the human terms anyway i i've worked in really good positions and i love the business world which is one of the realms i'm taking i'm a ceo of onequest international and we will be producing products from heaven and put them in the marketplace and one day we'll be all over this earth with our um one quest doors one quest for one god and that's to create heaven on earth it's our motto and we have to live heaven culture our whole staff has to live heaven culture or they'll hear from me god has sharpened my discernment until it's almost like wild crazy and i can be in another room and if something's on television those very images come through the walls into the room i'm in how many parents want that and if people have been listening to things and you know on tv the show might be okay but the commercials are crummy we need a network that doesn't have any you know if you're going to show a certain kind of a show and and um the program materials decent and family oriented they shouldn't show scum on the commercials amen i am i'm going to have a voice in hollywood and they're going to hear from me continually because i'll be there a lot one day we'll have a series about the guardian angels on tv like a sitcom if anybody was funny and their lives were fume he'll filled with humor it would be your guardian angels amen and produce movies from hollywood too showing the truth about the spirit realm and all kinds of things god told me years ago i'd be doing that and he's right and i've already been contacted by producers to start working on scripts so it is gonna and god's setting up hollywood for heaven and for him anyway that's why they've changed what there's some of the stuff they're producing which i said five or six years ago that was going to start happening i knew because god had shown me so this is a simple truth it's about the scripture god used when he showed me was come before my throne of grace to find help and grace in time of need now you notice there's an action and he in in that in that scripture is not talking about the eternal grace you get from receiving jesus christ this is grace for abundant life abundant life there's grace for eternal life all comes from the same place but the grace that god gives himself jesus has grace for eternal life the father has grace for abundant life and he said i filled my son with my grace and jesus came to bring life and bring it more see it talks about it in the word of god in both of those places and he caught me up and he said i don't want you coming out of your room in the morning and being you i want you to come up fill with heaven he said if you will do this simple thing then you will change you won't even be the same you because i'm very bold at home when you're in charge of 12 kids 12 siblings there was 15 of us and i was one of the ones who was a leader in charge from the age of eight so that's why i get to have fun now and have pink care he said if you will say this every morning before you get out of your bed then we will send fuel from heaven and fill you with fuel for that whole day and no matter what you face you will respond only with the fuel from heaven and not in your flesh and he's he actually said he said hold out your hands and say this father i ask for and receive grace for this day amen and right now i'm standing here i feel it pouring into me it's still pouring okay it stopped and i the first time i did four stone i felt it in heaven and the next day when i woke up i didn't get out of my bed because if you jump out of your bed you'll forget if you forget and you start having a bad day you will remember that you forgot to ask and i have a stack of emails from all over the world that says out of everything you've taught this one thing changed my life more than anything else because you don't get thrown into fear you don't get thrown into strife you don't get thrown into arguing nitpicking bickering complaining it will not come out of you and my family was so shocked see i'm nice now he did as early on and so i taught all of them and we don't have strife in our house there's no strife because we're filled and if one person forgets you stand out like a sore thumb and we will point at you and say you go get your grayson on the door of my house on the outside of my door it says did you get grace today and i've had delivers a little ups and you know federal express and they go here's your package but do i need grace because i tell people you can't come in unless you ask for it we want to have a pleasant day and so i teach them how to ask for grace it works by the way for it works for believers and non-believers say wow when god made us incent us he loves all of us okay he wants the vilest intercept free there are things he set in motion that works for either or now we get bonuses and we get promises and we get blessings that those don't that don't know him but there are things that he will even do for the unsaved if they ask and if you disagree that's just too bad i choose to not agree with your disagreement and so this little thing says father i ask for and receive grace for this day amen and people said will you give us something to remember by so here's a little tent card that you can set anywhere and on the other side is the prayer that all of your family and loved ones in heaven declare over your unsaved family members on the earth and the father said everyone on the earth needs to declare this over their family members that are not saved then you're agreeing with heaven i've seen people's grandmothers mothers sisters brothers leaning over a portal in heaven and say these very words over their family members and this is what it says i declare that all of my family my friends and those that i love will become mighty children of god they will be free in jesus name they will not miss their destiny they will become the living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ and if you don't know how to pray for your family members you say that because then that's you know that's what that's what they say in heaven and it's powerful so i also have a bunch of these to give out and uh okay we're gonna yell wait till i tell you okay i gotta hurry up and do this because i've got other stuff to share with you and then i'm laying hands on everybody i i don't have any products left out there but i will let you know that we will take orders you can pre-pay and we will ship the stuff to you because i know sometimes you just don't like to take the time to go online and we didn't think we would sell out everything the first meeting but we did and but we will take your order back there and you can still pay by card or something if you want to they have forms to fill out please print clearly we do not read hieroglyphics we do not interpret those and some people write like that so i have five of these and whoever yields grace the loudest good luck and i'll talk about this while she's doing that okay y'all y'all can listen here's a dvd this dvd will change your marriage and if you don't need it you know somebody who does it'll still work for them it's got passionate power this is all revelation i didn't get any of this stuff from research this came when god caught me up to heaven and told me things showed me things and had me come back write it down and produce stuff so you have revelation from your father on what's coming and how he made you put you together where you were before you all those things are in these all these revelations and this one says um for adults only rated m for married couples only unless you're also engaged okay empower your marriage with heaven's greatest weapon love stop making war and start making warfare [Applause] married couples stop making war with each other and start making warfare with each other amen and god's way is by using passionate power if you're lacking in finances check out your love life with your spouse amen that's what it says and it's a dvd me and my husband in here and we we prayed and declared over everybody at the end so here you go so everybody just yelled passionate power [Music] this is gifted this is powerful revelation this is when god caught me up to heaven he said i'm going to show you all heaven operates who wouldn't want to know that [Music] i'm just going to read it on the back it says every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights we are the gifts that were sent by the father he puts his light in us find out where you lived in heaven before you we're knit together in your mother's womb amazing revelation on the word of god received when caught up in heaven which helps you identify your natural gifts and how we help establish the kingdom of god in the earth by using them ephesians 4 talks about some of the gifts the five-fold ministry but what are the rest the world has no problem identifying their natural gifts but the church looks for their spiritual gifts which is also important but your natural gift will be used in heaven your spiritual gifts will not be needed in heaven amen this uh all the five hope ministry are fishing or voting or whatever they're doing cooking baking grilling whatever they're doing that they love to do painting whatever it is photography playing chess holding antique car shows going to rodeos or running them this revelation releases you into supernatural realm as the father shares his plans for his end time sons and daughters to use their natural gifts in the marketplace and even open doors for others to do the same and so this is really powerful amen say gift go trishka these are my books and i am writing books three bit but stop calling and asking for it because book three will be bigger than book one and two together there's 25 illustrations of heaven in the spirit realm in book three and i've got 13 chapters so far but there's going to be 25 chapters and a lot of revelation so this is my first book um heaven picked out the cover the name the colors on the cover they picked out everything and even gave me the chapter title so i would know what to write about because it was when he said i write books i'm thinking how am i ever going to figure that out i have two scribe angels assigned to me and that's why it says forward by scribe angels on the front that is not a band people say is that a band no those are actual scribe angels who come and deliver messages from god or record things that you say and they came and uh they actually tell me the chapter titles that's their assignment when i'm done with book three they'll probably get to go home and be happy they're there they have to live with me and one is funny and one is holy they need some prayer they've been working on it though okay and so uh the forward in this book is the only thing that i didn't write personally this is uh the word that god gave for the forward is uh the scribe angels delivered it to me and it's about this time we're living on the earth right now is about the move of god coming on the earth i'm going to take a moment to read it to him who sits upon the throne we give praise honor and glory forever and ever that he would desire to reveal his home in the heavens to the men on the earth rejoice o earth rejoice for heaven is about to kiss you and when it does the fire of his passion will consume every living being he will forever leave his mark remember that word on the hearts of millions and they shall come to know him as their savior be thankful citizens of earth that you are living in the day and hour when the glory of the lord will cover the whole earth how magnificent in his ways how mighty in his hands is the act of him who sits upon the throne in eternity they shall sing about these days the great and powerful days before the end comes see he said before the end comes all things will be shaken and all things will be restored to and through god's faithful believers prepare o enemies of the most high to be made his footstool none will escape his glory and there will be no place to hide from his light he who has chosen this handmaiden to reveal the hidden things the precious things and the treasures he stored up in his heaven for those who love him and love the coming of him we his faithful scribes created by him in the beginning to serve in his celestial realm and to record the words of those we are sent for and to deliver and release his messages to those whom he trusts are grateful to be a part of his divine plan in revealing heaven this is one of my favorite parts prepare you faithful ones who have stood under much warfare and devastation of the enemy prepare to receive great reward now in this lifetime and in the glorious life to come you are about to see the power of your god released and you will know that in this time he is in control he's in control of what his plans are but we have to work them out we have to walk them out for him amen behold he is his fire comes to blaze across this world and into the hearts of men to push back the great darkness and claim his creation back to himself that's also being done through us by demonstration by manifesting with his glory that's joel 2 prepare men and women of god those who watch over the souls of their congregations to yield to holy spirit of god when asked to lay down your plans man's plans and allow him to take control during this hour for those of you who yield there shall be great increase of anointing in your ministry for those who refuse to yield your place shall be given to another and some will even sleep early this is a time god has had planned before even this earth was made it's on his timeline it's very important to god it'll be a time when this whole earth learns there is a god and they're going to see in our lives and by the choices we make and the actions we take it's very important for us to surrender he needs surrender prepare your hearts for he must first visit his leaders and then his church body will you all be able to stand and carry this glory or will be exposed by its coming the bowls before the altar are tipping and the veil of flesh has been torn nothing or no one can stop what is about to happen and you are living in this time manifestations of his power through signs wonders in the miraculous will happen everywhere no building will be able to contain them he will no longer be put in a box nor will he wear any man's tag but he will unite his true body of believers and the world will know them by their love for each other prepare to hear a new sound the sound of heaven this is a glimpse into eternity prepare to be forever changed prepare people of earth because god is revealing heaven and so that's the forward in in the book and and so this one you can whoever yells [Music] [Applause] one thing i've noticed about the holy spirit is he is a great poet the holy spirit loves the arts jesus loves people he loves to make things with his hands he loved being a carpenter he makes carpentry in heaven he makes furniture and puts it in your mansion amen he loves that and he loves sweets he loves dancing and he loves flowers that's why he's called the olivia valley the rose of sharon that's why he was in the garden tomb that's why he created the garden of eden you get a clue that's why he went to the weddings they had sweets dancing and flowers and that the holy spirit told on me told on him about that amen and so he had me write this poem and book two is called heaven oh how fair is that wondrous place where finally you see him face to face or a passion you find in those beautiful eyes so much it causes your heart all evil to despise many times angels kept me from hands of death they came so near i felt heaven's breath my life one day will tell hope's story the days of being hidden in unspeakable glory forever grateful to have lived surrendered every hour that i had been willing in the day of his power and the fullness of time the spirit will catch me up no more to roam place me in the father's arms and i am home and they're beautiful this is book two and these books are evidence of the even a jury would have to say was truth and the reason why he gave me a commission it wasn't just to go and see heaven it was to have evidence put in my hands that nobody could say was not truth and in that first book is what he would do to catch me up he let me listen to people i never met before i'd know i know all kinds of things about them what they did when they were kids who their family members were i was walked through their mansion i knew what their gifts were what they were doing in heaven i knew all kinds of a lot of stuff the guy would bring me down have me type it down and then he would give me their family their family's name and number on this earth and then he had me go and call them and go share after they got over the shock i didn't have pink hair back then but that's what's in this book and then when years later i would type it down meet with them in the park or the mall because nobody knew me they didn't trust me but they were too hungry to know about their family member and they would sit there in absolute shock some of them would cry some of them would laugh and then in the end had to admit that i had been taken to heaven and i had seen their family members when i knew things that only their family members knew and then years later the lord walked back to the wall of my house and he they first came in 1996 and said they would take me on tours of heaven and i didn't say no okay i had a long long relationship with the lord long life of surrender i wasn't perfect but i had surrendered and they used me any way they wanted to they send me on a plane to some strange state and in the food court give a message to somebody i didn't know they would change their destiny and then i would fly back home and i never knew really what it was about but it didn't matter i obeyed and so he will look at you to obey say if i obey it will all be okay obedience is something that will mark this move of god um he has to i mean you have to know that when he says something you yourself have to know you will obey he already knows because he wouldn't have chosen you all right and so i was trained for like years and years and years to listen hear him and obey and then one day he came and said we're going to start taking on tours of heaven and this will be my 20th year and a 2005 walk back through the walls of my house sat down with me at four or something in the morning i go to bed at six now and sleep to about 10 or 11 if i come in the morning i will look like warmed over hash that's what my mama says i look pretty good tonight don't a mom i slept and and then in 2005 told me to go back to all the people i had given them their piece of paper to because i typed it down and gave it to them so they wouldn't have to try to remember what i saw and heard and get an official legal release sign with permission to use in the book with their real names none of the names have been changed not the people in heaven not the people who uh you know share the encounters with and then they gave me uh uh their permission to write the story of what i saw then their own personal letter stating how that changed their life and impacted their life that's what's in this book it's evidence that heaven is real and then many places in heaven how god feels about certain things like what he thinks about suicide in the dictionary suicide says somebody willingly knowing intelligently taking their life but what people are doing are not ending their life he said they're ending their suffering say amen uh and suicide would be a suicide bomber a suicide terrorist who is in the right mind with the right will the right emotions making a decision people who are under severe attack and pain and suffering are not in the right mind cannot use their will correctly and all they want to do is escape the suffering they don't want to leave here they don't want to leave her because they don't care about you they don't love anybody and god said i make the decision of where they go he said but most people are ending their suffering they are not ending their life and so you can think about the way you want to that revelation is in this book and he said that will help heal the hearts of many people who have been told their loved one was in hell when actually they were in heaven because they ended their suffering and they belonged to him so you can decide what you want to there's other revelation here about many things this is my second book and here you go this [Music] [Applause] [Music] and uh and now we get the sweets okay [Applause] these are ring pops i nullify all the sugar in them and and i release the anointing into every one of them the anointing and the life of god since the holy spirit made me buy them the holy spirit said get them and give away something that's fun so here you go and and if there are children out there you know look for the children first and if i miss you i love you anyway but we are going to give these out i'm just going to give you the bowl oh i want you to see how bold they are [Applause] [Music] you know i love talking to children and sharing with children i'm telling you what their kids already taken the power over the enemy in their school and losing the host of heaven to pull down the strongholds uh i mean there's eight and nine-year-olds doing that right now and they'll never have a tax at their school because they're already dealing with the enemy so make sure all the ones who are down here getting them amen yeah don't eat it in the service please stick it in your pocket woohoo [Applause] [Music] okay i'm gonna i've got to see what time it is because i don't have a clue see i have no idea it could be six a six i don't know what time in it okay all right well i know the kids get loosed at 10. is that true and um the next time i come back i want to have a special meeting added to my schedule to talk to the children only because they need revelation then the enemy won't ever get them half of everything we produce out of one quest international will be for youth and children everything they wear sleep on look at play with all with heaven revelation in it amen so i have a few more minutes and then i'm going to lay hands on everybody and i don't mind laying hands on the children too so that might work out really well if we do that and then we can dismiss am i supposed to take up another offering or no oh so i have to do that first so we're going to have to take a few minutes to take up the offering because the holy spirit said this is what he does i'm on fire i'm just going he says you need to stop and ask joan about the offering so so let me tell you what almost everything i got in my life i got from seeding i am a huge cedar so much so that for the last three years every gift has been given to me i had to give it away and i had no problem and it didn't matter how much it was i would get so excited when people would send me money in the mail because i'd ask god where do you want this to go remember that you send it you spend a thing i had to live that in my life and i and so one time someone sent me ten thousand dollars and i almost was beside myself thinking oh my word what can i do with this who can i give this to who can i bless with this there was never anything about how my it's not in me to say how am i gonna spend this that's why i'll have unlimited millions one day because if he sends it whether it's 10 bucks or 500 million he is going to spend that money and he has a lot of plans for those finances and money and sometimes it's to pay off ministries uh debts buy buildings build places for people you know buy car lots and give the cars away for free because i don't need the money that they would make me i'm going to foreign countries and sending and building entire centers to be used for these children being rescued i have plans god has plans amen we'll have a lot of stuff one day to give you for free my heart is i was raising a huge family and we didn't have a whole lot but we shared everything we had it didn't matter how little was my dad my earth dad put in me everything you have belongs to god and we loved giving it away and we would chase you down the street to give you something even if it was a plate of cookies you know we like sweets too and so uh everything i got everything that i will have in the future is coming from all the seeding i've been doing over the last several years and i know this is what god says to me you do not have a need just remember or remind me of your seed and so this is what i say to him when something is due i said i don't have any needs remember my seed i gave it all well i actually can stand here and say that i gave it all remember that i gave it all away i gave it all away he said this one why one day i'm giving you a blank check because i gave it i there was never never any problem about getting money from me i couldn't wait for it to come so i could give it away and he has sovereignly taken care of me because you know when you do this and you don't travel you don't get money when people travel like i do like matt does and joan and them their their finances come in usually when you're traveling or when you're selling stuff trust me most of the time it's not from the stuff you sell because you have to put all that money back in to make more you got to keep putting it in there to make more and produce more and be able to do more uh one day is coming where we'll be giving money away when we go places i was shown by god one day i will bring buckets of money and when they take after they take up the offering then i'll send out the buckets of all the stuff i have and let everybody take money out of them like thousand dollar bills that's my heart that's where my heart is my heart is to give because god made us givers so i don't understand why people don't want to give and if you don't have anything you specifically ask for seed he said he will put hand uh seed in the hand of the sowers right and in this time on the earth i happen to know it's already happened to me i'd already purposed in my heart to give something to somebody and already had written down on the list i will give this and a hundred times more than that came in the mail the next day before i could get that money in the hand of that person remember that thing about the remember that that the harvest will overtake the sower remember that it's already happening amen so get your offerings ready and make them out too jhm i can't remember how to spell sometimes i'm very connected to heaven when i get home i probably won't know where to sit down if they ask me they'll just shove me somewhere because my mind's connected to heaven it takes several days to wear off and if i go to another place it just never wears off and i don't know what hotel i'm in what room i'm in you know i come out of the room without the key and i don't know who registered me and i'm wandering in the hotel and here i am with pink care at 3 a.m in the morning wandering through the hotel and they go well um what room are you in i don't know well where's your key i don't know i better think i left it in the room i don't remember the number of uh well who'd you come with i'm trying to remember which staff member came with me because they don't let me come by myself it's very clear why not well what what name did you register under i don't have a clue because the people bringing me uh probably registered in some name so i'm just don't know anything and they're like well what do you suggest we do i suggest you let me use your phone and i will call the number of whoever's in the room that came with me i'll call our company a staff phone and find out if they can come and rescue me or i will have to knock on every room in the hotel and asked him if i belonged there so i don't go alone don't don't think you can i can't come alone okay i would be in the airport having a meeting having missed three flights in a row and not know what time it is because i'm sharing heaven with people i've even changed the mind of evolutionists and now they're born again and they're going to a christian college instead of becoming an evolutionist professor which is what they were and i told them about the creation of the earth and how god made it and stretched the you know the scroll around the physical realm and kept talking i never stopped and he's sitting there with his mouth open going he was going to argue with me about evolution he gave up the argument and got saved and that's because our plane got bumped and we were delayed for three hours and i was celebrating because i knew god had an appointment i don't complain when things change okay get ready for strange change you can write it down get ready for strange change so have you already taken up the offering are you taking it up are you ready raise your hands say here's my seed father i bless this offering god i bless your people who are here tonight abundantly in every area of your of their life father and i'm going to declare what you've started to have me declare i am asking for a thousand-fold return and it has already happened in some of our meetings uh or i wouldn't still be doing it i'm excited this is the time for the thousand-fold return surrendered poured out lives right now i'm telling you you have no idea what god is about to send and put in your hands if he can get it to you amen and send it through you he's not going to stop sending it to you father bless everybody who's giving and i even say bless the hearts of those who don't have but are right now actually saying god i ask you for seed to put into a into a place god that's producing for you that is good ground for you this is heaven's ground this place is heaven's ground okay everybody say this place is heaven's ground i'm giving seed into heaven's ground and i receive a thousand-fold return in any way you want to give it to me amen that was our prayer i'm going to keep going y'all can start taking it up okay so let me see how much time do i have left well the kids are going to be out in a few minutes that powerful generation of god and i can tell you this that if your child was especially challenging they were highly anointed the ones who are really challenging are highly anointed what do you think jesus was anyone who will run off from their own parents and stay behind in a city and people go how did that happen because jesus did on a continual basis only he would usually run through the caravan and stay with other people in the caravan this is the first time he actually stayed in a city he left the caravan and stayed in the city and then it took several days because those were big caravans that they traveled with and by the way it was not three kings or three wise men that came to bring a treasure to man it was caravans say caravans it wasn't a camel or three camels it was hundreds of camels they came from three different places each one of them had their own supply carried their tents their provisions their living uh stuff all their food the way to repair the food had their servants and had the people who took care of the herders that took care of the camels there was a lot of people in those caravans and i i laugh kind of i know it's precious but when it shows the three of kings with three camels on the christmas cards they should have a whole line as far as you can see in the background because it was caravans that came and they actually brought supply for jesus's whole life it was god's son do you think he was going to send a couple nickels those were priceless things that he sent priceless from three different places and it took two years for them to cross the desert jesus wasn't a baby it's the way they show it and i don't have a problem with that you know god does not god's not out there fussing saying that they didn't show up at the manger that's not right he's not wringing his hands over that we need to stop nitpicking about ridiculous things they did bring treasure that part was real and it was a lot and right after that was when they had to escape into egypt remember that thing some people don't read the word read the word of god you will read it in heaven and learn it in heaven there's a word university you will not escape it the one who wrote the book teaches you the book that's true isaiah will teach you king solomon yes he made it he'll teach you you know moses will teach you uh matthew mark luke and john they'll all be teaching you in heaven amen word university is amazing you don't sit in hard chairs in a room it's exciting and adventurous but you will learn so read the word of god and so they did have to escape into egypt and jesus was taught by the best tutors he was taught the torah and he loved to read and he loved to share those were two of his favorite things when he was in torah school he loved to read and he loved to share what he didn't care for was writing don't get on your kids if they kind of fuss a little i mean you all have to learn to write by the way don't just learn to type on a computer learn to actually write words because some places aren't even teaching that anymore they're not they're kids a little tiny age they go get them a tablet and that's they do everything on their tablet my grandkids they're like age 8 and 14 15 and they all use tablets in school not paper not pencils not not bins they type okay so make sure you teach your children how to write also it's a wonderful gift and so he didn't care too much for writing and i actually learned that that's why there's 10 commandments and not 20. this is a joke but it is true too he only wrote 10 you know he and you know it was written by the hand of god is that right everything was done by the word the word did it god spoke in the word did it and so he only wrote ten commandments aren't you glad it was only ten and it was hard to live by those 10. thank god they came and died and you know even though we still have to use them as guidelines the two most important commandments in the word is love god with all your heart and love others more highly than yourself everything hinges that's what the word says everything hinges on those two things isn't it amazing it's about loving it seems to be one of the hardest things that we do love love unconditionally amen in this time on the earth you are going to have to learn to love and there's going to be a lot of unlovely people put in your life strange people abandoned people rejected people despised people and the churches will fill with them i had to tell my pastor years ago get ready because god said you're going to have a special ministry to the homosexuals and god will send you people who he has prepared and are highly gifted and ministering to those people and one of the groups that i was shown literally taken forward in time not just in the vision but taken forward in time in my spiritual body i saw millions of them have truth overwhelm them and they ran into the kingdom now now that's important the way he showed me he didn't just say they ran into the church they ran into the kingdom okay now the kingdom is supposed to include the church hopefully there'll be some that want to be a part there'll be some that don't want to be a part there's some that don't even want to believe that this is god doing this but the kingdom is what will actively be seen the kingdom of heaven on this earth in our lives creating inventing uh taking land and territory building things for god amazing things will be happening on this earth and one of the things is going to happen another thing i saw was millions of muslims racing into the kingdom becoming a part of the kingdom i saw nations that uh have up into this time not only rejected god but despised god and fought against gods and killed god's people and i saw that nation remember let's disciple nations that part well when they start running into the kingdom you better be ready to disciple them because they will demand to know more about god they'll demand to know about heaven they're going to demand to know these things that they don't have revelation of they just know they were touched by the living god and they know he touched him and they're going to want him and so your course that you were charting for you to know from heaven that the father told me before i came here to let you know you're not just charting your course for 2016. you're charting it for the rest of your life you're charting it for the rest of your life to be an active part of the kingdom releasing the kingdom that is within you he planted it in you okay you have a very important part everybody here has an important part nobody is not important and it's not a mistake that you're here okay you pursue the kingdom jesus talked all the time about the kingdom of god he talked about the kingdom how important the kingdom was how valuable it was talked and explained what it was like and i'll tell you what it is it's real simple it's matthew 6 our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven okay he is not talking about the millennial age in the millennial age god will not need our help jesus will be ruling as king of the world on this earth he's talking about demonstrating and manifesting for him now in this world right now now is an important role right now put the word now on your tablet this is not for six weeks down the road six months down the road this is right now you are living in this season where the kingdom will literally be revealed exposed explained demonstrated manifested and it's gonna stir up a lot of demons but we already have a group waiting to take them down called the host of heaven [Applause] and when you realize that it's part of the kingdom is to have an army say every king every kingdom has an army so this should not sound strange to anybody listening okay if you're part of a kingdom a kingdom has an army to protect and defend ours happens to be the unseen one but so is god so is heaven the unseen realm made everything that is seen it was the original realm and you're going to learn how to operate there chart your course to live in this world to produce things for god in this world to get your life in order in this world heaven and earth are going to work together in this habitation in this move of god like never before in the body of christ but you have to step into it you have to say yes like they've been saying through the whole conference all the stuff we've heard is all preparation to understand that yes we're going to live our life differently in this time in the earth different things are going to happen god is requiring you to surrender to his way and to his will in order for this to happen because it's his dream that he is revealing to this earth and i'm going to read to you really quick before i before i end i know this went fast but it just happens okay it just happens if i can find my little note i had to read you somewhere in here i have got i am packing to move i don't have the house yet but when he says you do something i don't wait anymore i have packed up my whole house and god said your office will remain here so remove everything from the house it looks like a home put it in storage and you make the offices here permanently so we removed everything from our bedrooms we don't even have a bed this is called obedience we have an office i now sleep in my office my bedroom is now my permanent office until he puts us in a real location and everyone in my house has had to get rid of their bedroom furniture now let me tell you it's one thing for me to do it but the whole crew has to go along with it because they're all a part of it so we don't have bedrooms anymore we can't even call them a bedroom that is my office come into my office i'll be up in a minute while i put my bedding away that is now on a sofa if you don't think he has me obey you don't know him it doesn't matter what he tells me now i do immediately i do not go by what other people are saying i certainly do not go by what is being said on the news what is being said and prophesied by people who don't understand what time it is god says don't clutter your soul with the doom and gloom and do not i'm giving you good advice do not clutter your soul with things that are not relevant to what god is doing it will bring confusion and conflict in your soul and you will flip-flop back and forth oh i want this i'm on fire for this oh i don't know someone just sent me an email saying that the the whole state of whatever is going to be split in half and tsunamis are coming and there's going to be anarchy in the streets and what are we going to do well i'm going to delete that that's what i'm going to do because i happen to know god's times and seasons and that is not for now and they've been saying that for how many years let god decide when jesus is coming because you are not going to make it happen what jesus said to you and i was take dominion and occupy occupy doesn't mean occupy a sofa and stare at the television occupy means like an army you take the land that spiritual land you take the atmosphere that spiritual atmosphere you get yourself ready and prepared look at your heart look at your soul see what your agenda is make sure it lines up with god and then you run after that and let god deal with everything else because if you are continually looking at what the world is putting out there or what people are putting out there that don't know what time it is you're going to miss your moment with god or you'll have to run to catch up because god informed me every year he gives my whole staff a contract to sign if you're going to be a part of what he's doing with what we're doing we we all have to sign it if you sign it you have said yes and you better do it he said if you step into this and step back you will fall behind and you'll have to run to catch up and you don't want to do that and then he gives all these lists you need to do this and this and this to prepare your life you need to step into this new time don't look back don't step back he said you have to get rid of anything in your soul that conflicts with what i'm saying is going to happen you need to get rid of any offenses any hidden wounds because wounds will also interfere with your life he said you can't keep any of the old habits old ways in your life you have to let them go to step into the new or you're not going to be truly stepping into that new there'll be things that will pull you back and your old habits and your old ways and this is a new thing say a new thing say there's new ways there's new patterns there's new words and we need to learn them and he goes to this list and there's only three things i notice god usually gives you three things it's not really that hard three things the other one is we have to love each other in my staff like he loves us we have to honor care about each other pray together and then and then the last thing he says i'm there he says these are all the promises i give you for doing all this this is what you will achieve in one quest if you will be obedient these things and the last line says this if you obey it will all be okay if you don't obey i will shake you because when he's given you and you have that vision and you know what that vision is you're actively working in that vision and and you have agreed to do that then you need to do what he's asking because you will be doing powerful things in this earth he's trusting you with powerful things with glory with revelation with people's lives with their destinies with wealth with great wealth like you could go by a city if you needed the city god's wealth and when he says the word wealth is not what we think of as wealth okay this is what he's about to download into the hands of those he's prepared to handle it and so it's real you can see the serious there's a serious side to doing this but the other thing is this that he has on that list and you better stop and have fun you make plans and you actually set dates on your calendar that these will be fun times and you will stop and have fun because if you do not have fun you won't be able to run and if all you do is be serious and profound and strict and look at this as a structure and a law he said you will become weary and you will want to give up so in this time on earth you have to have fun he said when you laugh like a child the enemy cannot speak to you he cannot get to you he cannot use you he said fun is a new weapon in the kingdom age [Music] he said if you're going to learn to live heaven culture you cannot leave the fun out he said fun is a weapon just like prayer just like you know when we were fasting a lot and i would encourage you there's a new fast for this time called the royal fast there's a big difference in the other fast that we've been having the royal fast is this you don't stop eating okay you don't stop eating but you don't eat any of your favorite things you don't drink any of your favorite things you don't wear any of your favorite clothes you don't watch your favorite shows you don't go see your favorite movies you give it up for whatever time frame he gives you i've been fasting mine for five months now i haven't had pizza or ice cream that is my food group okay he knows what my favorite things are and you know what your favorite things are okay and we tweak each other all day long and so the for the month of january we are giving up desserts which is really hard if you think it's not you try doing it sometime but the thing is this you go to reach for your same a little comfortable clothes you've been wearing he says you can't do that because the royal fast has everything to do with it is the opposite of the king's feast most of the year you will be living the king's feast because he wants you to that means you eat your favorite things you wear your favorite stuff you go to your favorite places as long as they're not darkness and that's the lifestyle he wants us to display and demonstrate to this world that we are prospering that we are joyous that we are celebrating that we are mighty in god he wants the world to openly see us prospering and being happy because they don't want some sour sad something okay smile sometimes even when you don't feel like it because it is like a medicine you'd be surprised what it heals on the inside of you so the world fast is something new it's totally different than any kind of fast we've ever had before he gave it to me and i've been sharing it everywhere i'll be putting up on my website and it's harder to do than you think it is but it's not like you give up everything you know the daniel fast was for daniel's day i'm telling you what the father said if he strictly and says to you personally you're doing the daniel fast but if he says you're fasting you need to do the royal fast it's for a new time a new age you're alive now you're not daniel you'll do things greater than him someday say we do the greater works so things are going to be different in our life and yet even though that's wonderful you still have to be willing to accept the strange i saw god's end time army they all had radical hair they had tattoos and this is the other thing you want to know pick a mark i'm not saying you have to tattoo it on you but pick a mark that represents what god this is he's serious he's having us get a logo designed for one quest to be our mark that the world will recognize this mark represents heaven and he says pick your mark or the enemy will mark you the world itself will mark you and try to put a mark on you and say who you aren't so i don't care if you use your initials or something some little symbol that represents what he has called you to do it's amazing to hold something in front of you that says this is who i am okay because it's identifying who you are yes god tattoos you when you get to heaven the name of the city of your god is here and the name of your god is in the palm of his of your hand that's why the mark of the beast will be copycatted in the head of all those who will choose him or in the palm of their hand the same exact places god marks you when you get to heaven the enemy knows it he takes it copycats it on this earth because he still wants to be god everybody say not gonna happen [Applause] amen so that's the end of my message and i'm gonna do an importation in everybody we can do it very quickly and once you're done you know uh i'm gonna just pray a dismissal right now unless joan has something to say tomorrow night at six o'clock doug addison correct do not miss it i was told by god this would be hilarious it would be fantastic it would be amazing and uh and he had me talk about that a lot so we are and i will tell you um how we're going to do this okay because i know that we have to kind of try to i know they have they have deadlines too to get this place set up for tomorrow don't miss tomorrow release the anointing in your life be empowered by god and just i'm telling you it's going to be strange it's going to be amazing and it's going to be god but what i do literally is have people and you can do it as you walk out if you collect your stuff i god has accelerated everything impartations are being accelerated you either receive them where you're at and then angels come and place stuff in you and on you and i know tonight they're up here with urns and you're going to get seeds of revelation thrown into you they've been doing all night long he's giving out a special anointing to rule and reign with christ in this time on the earth and but i'm actually going to touch each person and you're going to come up and walk past me as you're going out row by row that's how i'm going to do it it's very quick you don't have to fall down this is something he's planting in you that you will need to help chart your course okay and you just remember when you row by row one row at a time yeah why don't we start with the back row first and then it will empty it it works faster trust me if they come the back row first and they go out and then each row empties and by that time you're up here and you can just you can go back out there we will be taking orders at our table and i think there's still jones table and i think doug's table probably has i grabbed stuff off a duck's table myself and matt's table i got stuff from everybody this is what we're gonna do you need to listen y'all listening wave your hand wave your hands i want you to hold your hand out one hand out and i'm going to slap that hand and you this is the impression you're going to get you're going to get an impartation of what i carry to receive revelation i have the right to impart that to you you're you're also going to get the life of god imparted into you is something he has me give everybody now and you're going to get the the power imparted into you already planted in you to rule and reign but you have to tap into that yourself and i'm going to stir up the creativity and you're getting all that by one slap on your hand when i do that i want you to say to me i receive it if you have children i will also impart it into your children okay and i'll even high-five them kids can high-five me if they want to get it left and okay to the right okay and we'll direct you to go to the left so they're going to come around father i give your son a heaven impartation amen i give your daughter a heavenly father i give your daughter heaven's imputation [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
