[Applause] and for those as she's getting things set up we have baskets up here and those are offering baskets hi Susan good to see you sister offering baskets if you hear something which you will and when you hear something that you want to sow into and grab it you sow into it we want to bless her so much when she goes back she's gonna freak out when she sees the multiplication that happens because she is a prophetess and we want to bless the prophetess in her ministry so so because she's gonna go and we're gonna pass baskets at the end but if you have to leave early please make your way up here if you don't if that weirds you out to come up then give it to one of the ushers that are standing in the back and they will receive that offering and put it in the offering basket for you can you turn her up Lisa please oh now you can hear me okay yeah I can hear now it's just making is that making it rain I'm always excited to come here because I don't have you know boundaries put on me some places just afraid of the new and actually it's not really new it's just being revealed and all through time God has done that when it was his time to do something new it was revealed in the earth it was always his plan we're just finding out about it and that's true in every age this come on this earth God has done something new new things to say new ways to live new ways to operate like them because the Bible says we're supposed to do that right course food who are we supposed to be like say Jesus really loud does he want us to operate like he did then don't be afraid to do it you know I'm not afraid of the face of man that's not gonna work I've already been in his presence I know what his heart is I know what the father's plans are for the sir it's not time to end it yet I tell people stop fighting about the time when you want to escape on your rapture odd I have news for everybody the rapture is not an escape it will be a celebration isn't that true it's a celebration because an escape would be fear and he has nothing to do with fear and neither should you there should be no fear in you God holds you in his hand when he's ready he's taking you home nobody can stop that but if he want you to stay nobody can stop that either you know John could have stayed John the Beloved could still be here amongst us if he decided to stay because Jesus said to the disciples what is it you but I love him to remain until they come again has he come again yet then that means John could be here correct how long would that have been so if God decides to keep somebody two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred years now what is it you I'm saying yes by the way I won't even buy a life insurance policy my staff walked into the phone when people want to sell life insurance oh she doesn't want it well can we ask her no it won't do any good but everybody needs it and they go no she's not planning on dying and then they hang up and we all laughed for that but I'm not I have no plans I lay down my life I live in him as long as he wants me here I'm staying I know John missed what he saw he missed it so much he couldn't stand to be here anymore nobody took his life either nobody killed him no disease took his life he decided to go how about that it's people go oh no you you can't choose with this day or not yes I can I can choose that it's up to him when I go but I don't want to go I'm not missing anything I'm not missing anything he's gonna do on this earth as long as he wants me to here be here I'm staying and one day I want you to plan to come here I'm just letting you know that I'll just show up I walked through the wall I've been here on the blackboard in heaven they have no time I want to live that way I want to be just like them let us make man in our image and after all excuse me I've been talking so much I don't know where I left my water I think it's on the floor that's somewhere I'll be sharing about this a little bit but I just got back from Hollywood and I talked non-stop I did make some side meetings so I'm not even talking about the meetings I did I'm talking about the producer I met with [Music] God is taking Hollywood I mean seriously he is taking it and he'll is terrified no he'll can get mad but the time will come when they get so afraid of you you become dangerous well I'm dangerous and when I go in somewhere in Hollywood they run out they won't they won't they can't stand to be near me they don't want to be near me they will burn like they will literally burn and they'll feel the pain I'm of sure one day says make them feel the pain and on the back will be a devil and they'll be going like this I want to share a couple things though before I actually start because I almost never do this but we actually have some new things we're in Phase two of what God called me to do the first whole half not half the first season I had in doing this was to reveal heaven to earth the second season is to create heaven on earth that season will be much longer than the first one it's still a way to reveal it but why not be able to hold it or wear it or sit on it or watch or have it in your walls or have it in your floors heaven is invading literally invading people's lives everywhere in ways that we maybe not expect one of it is going to be the movie industry and so God is making us extremely bold about what we say so there's no question when you're in that arena you need to make sure there's no question about who you represent I'm gonna make that perfectly clear and then the Holy Spirit always gives us new little we call them Kingdom quotes but they're actually Holy Spirit quotes he makes me save him I purpose because he likes to hear them and our newest one is I don't do demons in case hell should wander by we want to make sure they remember the day they were kicked out with a lightning bolt which is right in the middle there you go bring back back back to the remembrance in case they forgot so this is a car magnet we don't do traditional bumper stickers just can go on your car and it's huge [Laughter] it does get looks we just released it about a month ago we have buttons that you can wear and talk about you want to make a conversation just wear one and walk somewhere and people love especially in our country they love to read any kind of a sign or button you're wearing or t-shirt or cap that you have to see what it says they literally have to see it and I've seen people follow people down the street so they can finally read the bumper sticker so now they see this and right along with this one we have other ones we have one that says roll up your wraps your rug and rule okay so right there's I don't do demons roll up your rapture rug and rule there you go what does that mean one of my staff said why don't we just say roll up your wraps are there every Baptists on the earth could be so mad at us they'd be thrown things out so we got to say why okay why number one it is not time for the rapture right now we haven't occupied that means take Dominion take Dominion deucey do something powerful with your life I will I'd I had to read an entire movie script in 20 hours because I will be editing it thank God Margaret was with me and this can be powerful not like anything you have seen on this earth anywhere not anywhere at all and so we also have along with the census since this is the Holy Spirit's favorite quote right now we also have a cup cozies and if I can get it on here I might it does if it fits water bottles but it also fits cups and then make it fit this one now nobody has these yet it also says I don't do demons take your water bottle to work set it around you will stir up things so these are brand new and everything we have is made in America since I'm going to market this okay this is sewn on two sides but it lays flat for traveling we plan to take hundreds of these overseas with us and and it says they don't do demons and on the back is where you can find out more revealing heaven calm and the Holy Spirit picks the colors everything he wanted to make sure you could see this a mile away okay so this is another thing we've got right here we we have we have gone back because we used to have these when I first started we didn't have any maintenance so we've had some new ones made it does have the book cover on it revealing heaven we'll have a book to also have one with its colors and when I get booked three them will do that this is also made in America this opens and shuts it does not come off and this however you get it off you snap it off but look how hard that is this double double pane double insulated made in America dishwasher safe microwave-safe how about that and yeah for hot or cold and it works we've tested all of our own stuff so I love that we can put maybe this is our newest one it literally just came out hey we made this thing as big as the magnet are you kidding 22 ounces I don't do jima that's good because this one is yours and I love the colors we make sure everything matches well you know the Holy Spirit doesn't like a lot of clutter on things because they want you to see what it's sayin right and so this is our newest one we literally just got them I love them and because we're making a statement this is what the Holy Spirit said you're making a statement about who you are and what you stand for without blasting any other denomination or religion you're literally can safely if you care make a statement about what you believe in what you don't tolerate and people are sowing dunks they've never seen anything like this before you know it's either something very liberal or demonic or you might have a cross on something but God is into saying very plainly what he means and this means you are not partnering nor tolerating nor participating with darkness of any kind whatsoever and so people have to say well what does that mean well I just tell them that means I torment demons that's what it means and then I quote a scripture you know this is what this means this is our privilege in this time as the body of Christ you know God had his time when he kicked him out of heaven right when they were all became evil and then Jesus had his time when he wasted hell on the third day and melted the faces of the principalities and powers in hell stripped their leader of everything took every gemstone off that God put on him and took the keys of hell death in the break so guess who gets the third show we do God said oh it's the show he said I am a show person all the way I was the first show man in the center ring when I kicked all those all those demonic angels out that they rose up against me he said there was light lightning bolt there was action they went down there was lights and there was action ok this is the Sun in hell all darkness you know ready for by the way Satan was planning a show by the way if you didn't know that he was Satan was planning a show himself to torture the Son of God in front of all of his demons and he actually called in the principalities and powers because they don't stay in Hell they are seated on Thrones on dark Thrones all around this world so he called them in to hell to the courtyard of Hell where he was going to put the show on well guess what the Son of God put the show on and it says so in the Bible he spoiled ruined principalities and powers and made a show of it openly triumphing in it I call that a show there was lights the fire of God coming out of his hands there was action the melting faces of the principalities and there was a lot of noise the demons screaming now we get to manifest and demonstrate for him in this earth doing supernatural signs and wonders the greater works stunning hell and shocking this world so whether you knew it or not you're the 3rd show how about that so we like to make things that are you know preparing for the show right I'm wearing this pin that I wore the first time it was in 2016 early in 2016 when the elections well the the campaigning was going on and it says let the show begin and it has begun don't totally begun these are these coasters the ones that are made out of the pressed whatever that is they can get wet and then they drown you reuse them reuse them this is the weather warriors which we also are kind of still in charge of them what are the weather warriors we tell the weather what it cannot do we're not we're not stopping the weather we're stopping the destruction of Hell getting in the weather when God created weather for this earth he did not create it to be destructive it was a nourish and replenish the earth in the winter it was to cover up like the earth thrust right and and it does a lot of other things like kill the insects and the bugs unfortunately in Florida we don't get a lot of snow we didn't get a lot we don't get a lot of that down there but other places have it so God designed this earth to operate in a certain way but since there's a wicked evil being who hates everyone and including the earth here he has tried to take over himself and yet the Bible clearly says Jesus gave us power this is not my message yet this is my introduction the word clearly says that Jesus said to all believers I give you power over the power of the enemy so this is using that power right here God did did not design hurricanes himself Satan gets involved in that and gets controlling them he wants to kill steal and destroy and he will use that in any form of whether he can while we're stopping it yes we have a right because Jesus said we were joint heirs what he did we can do he stopped to storm people we actually do that and there's a whole lot of people we now call them the weather warrior so God had us design a logo God is into images trust me this is another logo almost everything we have it's either a logo or it's the beginning of a move of God because I don't get to do anything that's normal okay I'm never gonna be normal not ever another thing we have the right to do is to command the host of heaven some of you may have a problem with this don't be concerned about commanding the host of heaven that would be the army of heaven and and God loves that army he designed them to war for us they are not protecting heaven they never have protected heaven they don't need to protect heaven the one who made them is on the throne so they've never stopped people from coming up into heaven and taking things okay although somebody translated that word you know about the kingdom of heaven suffering violence they think that means that people from earth are going up there and stealing things that literally came out of a Bible translation it really did I don't know how they got that I don't know where that even came from okay that scripture has a revelation to it the scripture is from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force is that correct is that what that scripture says well everybody's focusing on the word suffers because they don't understand although scripturally there is another meaning for that and the Holy Spirit showed me think of this scripture suffer the little children to come unto me now does that mean the little children are being attacked say no does that mean that he's saying cause the little children to come unto me encourage the little children to come unto me so let's put that word in the other scripture from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven encourages and causes spiritual violence to rise up on the inside of you so you the believer can take it by force from the enemy now that scripture makes sense doesn't it because it does not mean the other thing there's literally no way anyone's gonna get up to heaven without God's permission amen they want us to be spiritually violent that word is that means passionately violent against the spiritual darkness don't tolerate them don't participate with them and there's another scripture that clearly says that our weapons of warfare are not natural they are not physical but they are spiritual they say the word day they are supernatural and spiritual weapons and they pull down what what kind of strongholds are they pulling down they pull down principalities right and strongholds of darkness is that right that sounds like an army to me an army we've almost been totally ignoring for a very long time and yet they were created by God for us to be over angels are not over us it says in the times to come we will judge them does that say that the Bible so if we're going to judge them then they can't be over us is that correct we have some authority over them we cannot worship them but commanding if you look in the dictionary if you look at the word commanding it does not mean worship it does not mean we're worshipping but I happen to known the military must have orders I've had so many members of my family in the military including my husband was in the Marine Corps they cannot work on their own can you imagine them running out of boot camp taking weapons they barely not go in attacking things does that happen do they have to have orders from headquarters even when they're overseas they have somebody over them that has to give them orders heavens army is no different I have news to me even though there's an army that army cannot leave their bitters in heaven attack whoever they feel like that's not going to happen they have to have orders they operate by orders they harpin under the word of the lord so that means you're not going to move this army unless he lives in you and he operates through you they're gonna listen to anybody else but there had to come a time on this earth in order for them to fulfill their destiny that we could send them on missions ourselves are we joint heirs with Christ was he the Lord of Hosts did he command heavens army is that our right then why aren't we doing it well I know you are now but every time I introduce the army of heaven I always have to go through this preparation for people that never considered in their head they know what praying to Jesus they ask Jesus to send help but if we're like them and they create we can create if they come in weak in command is that right it is always his power that does it we don't do anything without Christ we don't get anything we can't have anything we can't just choose to do stuff on our own even in the same way we don't operate without Christ that army cannot operate without commanders back in 2014 I was shown millions of the army of heaven being sent to this earth and they were waiting 2014 the father introduced me to the army of heaven and taught me how to command them from that day I have not ever been attacked I am never sick they were made to keep us and protect us in all our ways the Angels we have with us all the time they're sent at the time of our conception at the time we are conceived they are sent I see them all the time waiting outside pregnant mothers those angels I know where hers are those angels that are waiting you're waiting for that baby to be born that's when you have guardian angels they don't just come to you and get a certain age they're there with you your entire life they have already got their orders from the Father they know boundaries that they have they know what they were sent there for the army has another purpose they are sent to attack and destroy the plans of the dark armies Satan has an army too it's not as big it's not as well organized it does not love each other they hate each other they kind of do what they wanted they get punished a lot but God's army cares about each other they work well together they are fierce against the darkness they don't ever abandon their post they're very destructive they operate in the spirit realm wherever you send them wherever there is darkness whether it was evil wherever there is violence you can send them there this earth is going to change drastically when the body of Christ finally stops fighting it arguing with it not wanting to do anything with it because they're afraid their lives are going to change especially in this time on the earth when God is boldly gonna have a step forth and start doing things okay and going places where they never wanted to go before you send the army before you all the strongholds are pulled down and we just had friends that just witnessed that I kept telling them they go on these missions trips all over Korea and the last time all the reporter was how many times they got attacked how many people were put in hospitals the own people in the hospital how many places they got rejected in places already agreed to have them come and I said when they were done but you did send the army right we forgot so when they went this year they sent me a text we have sent our army every one of us we are given them very specific detailed orders and every place we go they'll go there first they'll be there while we're there we don't expect a no holdups delays incidents accident sicknesses nothing of any kind happen every time they went to I forgot how many like 2030 cities they went to Korea I got a report every time every single time they were going to know that they know they sent the army not one incident not in their travel not in their protection not in the places they stayed in not the cities they went to there were so many miracles and souls one and the joy of it all they had any interference from the devil not one not one not one they want me to come back right away so that I can again teach and train their entire congregation how to command their own army from heaven that will live over your home in the sky they do not go back to heaven they are assigned by heaven to you people walk down my street look over my home all the time they can see beings there all the time don't look for somebody that looks like you those are Gabriel's group Gabriel's group look like humans except they have wings sometimes they hide them there on a Centon assignment on the earth could get easily move around amongst us the hosts of heaven would not be able to do that someone have six-inch years coming out of every pore of their being some are the weapon themselves they have 18 eyes okay they're made out of every kind of form of substance you can think of they could not easily move amongst us people would call them aliens and probably have in the past they're creatures almost every one of them are creatures creatures are in heaven they're ones that look like what we call part human part animal the living creatures don't get freaked out I'll give you proof the living creatures around the throne do not look like humans they have massive heads that are curved like this I know when people say they've seen them because that's what their heads are shaped like the one like a lion the one like an eagle the one like an ox the one that has the face of a man does not look like Jesus Christ because you have wonder they have eyes in their heads in the back of their heads and every one of their six wings they have hooves golden hooves for their feet they walk upright they have these gossamer gowns on that make a frequencies and they're about 80 to 100 foot tall every one of them are fierce don't go up to heaven try to make friends with them and the two that hold up the arms of the throne are even more weird they each have four heads they would not easily mix with people on the earth God has planned every design of every being he has ever made including you he knew what your face would look like before he made you before you were on the earth you got your body in heaven you were a little spiritual being some different sizes about this biggest different sizes you are made out of light you lived in him you moved in and out of him on the Rays of his rainbow that was the only place they could go move in and out they played inside they played in the River of Life that's where you were that's where you came from that's why he is your father that's why you are his sons and daughters you are says you are his offspring so anyone reunion if you have children let me see your hands are your children your offspring did the mother carry those offspring yes so she nurtured them right she carried them she had water in her womb so they would feel like it was a familiar place because inside the father is the river of life we played in it we moved in it that's where you lived you lived in the river of life you played on the stones of fire that's why we like sparkly things the stone sapphire huge gemstones inside the father you've jumped on them you played on them you slid down this mountain this powerful mountain that is inside the father you'd slide down the river of life you jump off the gem stones into the river of life and that's where you played so when you made the womb of a woman he put water in it so while you were growing inside you wouldn't be afraid we couldn't leave his presence and live somewhere in heaven you have not lived on the earth before some people believe all kinds of crazy things you didn't come to the earth until he sent you here he knit you together in your mother's womb when he took that little spirit of life from himself sent it by the Holy Spirit at the time of conception he knit it and attached it to that dot of flesh that is when life begins he sent you from himself he made this whole earth this physical realm just so he could send you here and you could have a body that's how well he plans he knows every day of your life he planned good things for you not the bad there's the evil being here named Satan some people think even he does not excuse me I've been to hell and I've seen him he hates everybody but himself his plan is to wipe you out every way he can anytime you can and right now powerful powerful children are being sent to this earth for the years that are starting on this earth some of the greatest leaders in the body of Christ they're still being born he needed him here now so he timed your birth on the earth you are wonderfully and perfectly made you carry parts of his image outside and inside how did I get all this information because I've been caught up to heaven non-stop since 1996 I didn't ask for that I don't I don't know how to tell you to get that Commission I was given the Commission I don't decide when I go how long I Stay I don't decide what I go see he does I come from many generations of believers who were sold out in love with Jesus Christ many of them had encounters with him but even the ones that didn't he never step back and they went forward in their life they touch this earth impacted this earth with their life never stopped loving God never stopped trusting him never ever ever ever I'm seventh generation I should be different I was not raised normally like a lot of people were I knew who God was from the time I could before I could walk I remember even laying in his hand when he was sitting on the throne he was talking to me I was about this big like this like a little like I was and even at that time this I know they say you know the sex of the child was determined in certain ways down here but let me tell you he wrote on your soul what you would be because he determined who he needed you to be male or female there is no other choice on your will on your will your will which is one of those powerful things you have I'm still not starting yet who here does not know but human soul looks like we see your hands if you don't know literally how it's made you know what your mind your will and your emotions but do you know what those things look like he showed me back in 2010 he showed me I have a photographic memory which comes in really handy with what I do cuz I've remembered every single time my mistake in heaven he showed me the human soul because he's gonna release something that would change the body of Christ forever and that's exactly what he said to me when they learn how to really guard their soul they can cause it to prosper their self when they get their soul to prosper they will always prosper and they will live in divine health so I am never sick because I order my soul accordingly I let no darkness in I don't watch anything that belongs I don't read it I don't watch it and I don't say it and I don't listen to it either it says guard your heart that is your soul you know the heart the word heart means something more than this thing is it on this side I forget this beating thing is not what he's talking about guard your heart is not about this heart it's this one the very core of your being in your spirit man is where your soul is guard that fraud will flow the way you live your life the issues of life for out of this soul that you have inside you will determine how you live your life as a man thinketh in his soul so is he so if you don't like you you can change it if you don't like things happening to you you can change that too if you don't like the atmosphere in your home you can change that too according to what you say what you think how you order your life can change your life when Adam was laying there not alive and God blew the Father the word was with him the word was always with him when they created that's why you can say talking of the word there's nothing that was made that was not made by him well how come the father was there they worked together all the time God spoke it the word made it that's how it works whenever the father said the word that's why it was his name would make it they were always together so they were together in the garden the word made Adam but he was missing something he wasn't alive he needed his spirit his little spirit man that had lived in God all that time kept him knew who he would become he leaned over and breathed that little spirit man these fear of life from inside himself or he had been living into Adams nostrils and then he said Adam has become a living soul that's very important that was now saying because we had souls wanted living in God we just didn't really need them because your soul you decide where you're gonna live what you're gonna say what you're gonna wear what you're gonna eat we didn't have to decide any of that when we lived him he was our home he was our very existence so he gave us something to wear right he nurtured us he's called the many breasted one he took care of us the whole time we were with him it says that in the Bible that just meant that he would comfort us he would hold us he would love us it does say that in the Bible depending on translation you get some of the newer ones I don't know what for if it says that or not but it does say that about him no matter how your father your physical one treated you on this earth he is your real father so your soul is very key to your very existence most of the time I grew up in church think I was born there practically we went every meeting we had in the churches that we attended and and I learned a lot I listened a lot I learned a lot but they never really told me what my soul was for except that it was not good almost every statement made it's dark man designs and desires bad things and things and bad things and well maybe if they choose that they do you know to a five-year-old don't know how darker could be and I would sit there on that pew and this is what I would think how could they say that I meet from God I'm light I carry light how can my soul be bad they just don't know something they just don't know this is at five I would think about those things my soul has to be good Jesus lives in it cuz I got born again 84 well no my souls not bad my cell no I think on the things of God No mine is not we need to find out why our solace for it's got to be important he didn't make spare parts and if they say it's my mind my will and my emotions that pretty much I could do nothing without it so he decided to literally show me and in 2010 he caught me up to heaven show me this is a human soul and the very core of your being is your will it looks like a column it is a column it's a strong column with writings on it that God Himself wrote on before he sent you here he wrote things on it no man can literally say and mean it that there is no God they lie or they don't know but they cannot say that or even really convince yourself even atheists when they get saved say I always knew there was something he wrote on your will and then attached to that will is your mind not your human brain your human brain is just kind of wrapped around that mind because when you die you still think when you step out of that physical body and you're in your spirit body you think you have emotions you make choices you'd be pretty bored in heaven if you couldn't your soul goes with you your body gets separated your soul stays with your spirit man you have your favorite places in heaven you have your favorite foods in heaven so that soul stays with you all the time it just fed all day long your physical body gets fed three times day unless you like to snack a lot in foreign countries eat twice a day America its three times with dessert and snacks but your spirit man your soul is sped all day long and if you play stuff at night it's fed at night what are you feeding you everything you see everything you hear everything you read and what you say yourself you feed other people's souls when you say certain things your into them I'm I'm feeding you everybody's soul right now your soul is taking it in you have layers in your soul it gets stored in there if there's ever anything you really forgot you need to remember just tell God that I need my soul I need to know from the files of my soul I need that I need that I said it till one time and in front of me sitting in my desk I needed a little scrap of paper pastor had written his name and phone number down he was gonna invite me to come and I lost it but I looked at it first I had read it looked at it read I knew the same shape and size of that piece of paper and it was stored in my soul this was like 2 years later when I can't find it I need it I know they want me to comment on one thing I'm ignoring them and when I said ok see my soul show it to me in front of me came this piece of paper out in the spirit it literally it literally just like this came out like this and I could see it it was the same piece of paper I had looked at because it's stored in you and he said write it down cleric it's gonna go back in there so get my pen I am writing as fast as I can I was so excited it didn't go like this flip flip now that is wonderful if it's something good but if you have horrible traumas that is also stored in your soul people get tormented for years about the things they had to witness or see it wasn't even anything they had to do with you don't have to keep it anything in your soul you don't want you loose it with the keys to the community you know what that says write the keys of the kingdom what you loose on earth does that mean you're going to keep it if you loose it nope and we always thought the keys at the kingdom wants to bind the devil they do a lot of things actually but what I was taught for the father that day was how to get stuff out of your soul whether it was addictions any kind of addiction trauma violent acts words that were said that you don't wanna remember those words they hurt they wound wounds out of your soul it doesn't matter what it is witchcraft practice against you it's gone gone gone angry hateful words offense and forgetting us gone God said I don't have six months for people I don't have six months for them to be healed anymore you can lose spirits of infirmity sickness and disease from your soul and it's gone and I just happened to glance in my clock and then he caught me up to heaven and he showed me the human soul then he started telling me one thing after another for another they can lose Cistus this assists this this this all this stuff all this stuff all this stuff they can choose to loose it and it we can't take it out remember it's loosed from heaven then you bind the things of God to your soul and this really changes how you live you think and you act you can actually say and now I choose with my will to bind to my soul the life of God the love of God the presence of God the plans and purposes of God from my life his creativity his celebration his expectation you get so filled with God and no one can take it out it's part of that abundant life and it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter how long ago you experienced things you can even lose things from your children Souls if they're not adults yet we've already had testimonies there's people being in the congregations you lay your hand on their head as the covering of their soul I chooses my will to lose from my child so every bit of the bullying that they Oaks means all the hateful mean disgusting vile critical words spoken over my child I choose to lose them from their soul right now haven't come down pulls them out it's like it never happened and kids go on happy like it never happened instead of being affected sometimes for a very long time like if you try out for something and you reject it sometimes it hurts children just loose it we have kids are doing on their own we have 10 year olds that command armies up from heaven because they didn't argue about doing it those 10 year olds are certainly not worshiping their commanding what do they do they command them to go to their school and protect every student there to stop all violence from coming into their zoo to pull down strongholds of Satan rising against the school too potent on strongholds trying to convince them that there's something different than they are you choose that's why he gave you a will that's why he will not control people Satan controls he'll be happy to take your will and do whatever he wants to with it and if you put enough of him in it you're gonna act like him is that right you choose with yourself who are you going to serve you choose each day am I going to choose life or death there's a lot of that going on in this election and a lot of people are choosing death that's not God God wants us to live and live more abundantly amen tomorrow night I'll be talking about America and Trump 2020 [Music] [Applause] but God has told me I think he knows amen he on purpose has chosen America to be a pattern that even other government leaders of other countries can choose to pattern their ways after America I remember I travel a whole lot in 2017 and I would meet up people from all over the world I never knew never met them they'd all come up to me and say you must be an American you have pink hair we don't have that here but we want to know what do you think about your president because what we've been hearing on the news we cannot possibly believe it could be true but he's already visited our country and encouraged our leaders we already know that business is booming in America we know he's creating jobs for that country we hope our leader becomes just like him but we want to know what do you think I said well I think 80percent of America loves him that's why they voted him in and by the way stop watching CNN I think the fake news doesn't like us either and I'd have these long discussions with these people never knew and these were like medical doctors I mean really leaders in their own community and it probably did from eight different countries and they all asked me the same thing and they got the same answer so God still has big plans for America you think he's wrapping things up in ten years I don't think so we are just learning to operate and levels of authority that were given to us by Jesus Christ we're just learning to really take authority over the weather because we're over it not under it if we're just learning this why would you wrap everything up this is what God says I will not have a weak pathetic testimony of my son's death and all he gave you I'm not taking anybody anywhere until they're operating like him so why do we do all this everything we do we do because of him we do it with him because of him and for him we're light in this world so if you wonder who to vote for someone who doesn't represent the darkness that does not represent death that cares about what's going on in this world or especially their country and God certainly cares about it he cares about everyone but but we were willing the body of Christ is willing to help God is that right they worshiped him they loved him they honor him what he wants they're willing to do the majority are willing they just don't know what to do some of them and since before pastors weren't allowed to give any help now they are of course you did design the Internet that bypasses everything so God has great plans and the next thing I'm going to show you is really the first time on planet Earth this has ever been done and the father said I'm going to ask you to do something I want it done right away he said I'm going to mark the year that I released for the first time the faces of the hosts of heaven to humanity he said I want you to put them in a calendar you're gonna call it the hosts undercover he said they'd better undercover for a long time but now they won't be because he's serious about crushing hell he does have he has a defined time when time will be no more if you want to know what that means I can tell you that means there'll be no more time to count days and there were no limit to space like in heaven there can be 10 things right here there's layers in heaven so the comet on many earths when time will be no more he will not need this physical and even when that happens it won't be a date it will be an event because God counts things by events the time just happens to fall in every time he does something he does it because of an event so on his timeline he measures his timeline by events that's how he does it so there'll be a certain event at one point when that happens he won't need this earth anymore there will be a new earth made the Bible talks about it some people don't want to even admit that day I don't know what this thing is are afraid to leave it I guess seriously there are whole groups now saying there is we'll just be remade or keeping it I don't think that's scriptural there isn't any they just think he's gonna make it all better it wouldn't be able to hold what he's got playing for us in the new earth you couldn't have put it the new earth will be so huge the very fact that the New Jerusalem will sit on that the earth this earth would go whoop just put this in just with the New Jerusalem honor okay what's that that's God's transport down to the new work that's what it is he's packing up leaving his own home he's always had leaving heaven one day because we will stay in his home for a temporary time when you die and move to heaven that your RNR you get a beautiful mansion you get to do things you never thought of before it's R&R for that place because God intends fully at one time when time as know where he's gonna take all of us and it by belonging to him that we are his put us on a brand new earth and he will pack up his bags get on the New Jerusalem and it will be his transport we will be down here waiting on the new earth for him we will see him coming these are real things that are talked about in the Word of God but people are so stuck where they're at they don't know how much further they can go so they don't really know where they are so they go to what they know they all talk about the tribulation they talk about the Rabb they don't know they talk about doom and gloom because you know the tribulation is doom and gloom right heaven isn't heaven doesn't give you a funeral somebody please have a party when their loved ones go home because that's what they're having in heaven they don't get a funeral in heaven they get a party it's called a celebration the Bible says he celebrates every time one comes home that is a celebration that's a lot different than the funeral it's a funeral would fun after you end so I'm going to show you this we have some back there I don't know how many we have but we're going to give this one to Dave and Dee Dee so they'll make sure they get one he had us create this it was definitely a supernatural thing because I have about 400 pictures of the hosts he actually sent them to me to get pictures of them it if there were a lot of them I took pictures if this is the thing if you didn't want them shown they they collapsed the picture did it was like no definition that's just a flat nothing and I began I said well what's wrong with this one he said no I don't want you to keep that one I'll get another one so perfectly sharp and clear he said you're gonna keep that one I didn't know it was keeping them to make this calendar we're gonna put them on a lot of other things cuz they will inspire you and empower you to know these guys are real and their greatest passion is to war against the darkness they didn't cry when Lucifer was kicked out the day Michael cried Gabriel Michael didn't try they had a party because they were fed up with Lucifer going around tempting their own friends to fall picture in your town and how did God deal with evil he kicked it out he didn't tolerate it he didn't make a place for it he didn't say it's okay you're different he kicked it out he didn't want it there he didn't want to filing heaven anymore it will never be allowed back he is not going to forgive Satan and he is not going to forgive one fallen angel they live with him they got one chance it's up soz about these guys in the unit on the front cover is a being I know I didn't not like this one on purpose sometimes we outlined them to help you in the corner we would show a being like this one then down here we just outlined it in case you couldn't tell because spiritual beings are made different the army especially they don't have a hand like this all of them don't some have a head they have more than one eye or they have one big eye guess what else I cops thing came from the enemy will take anything you can that balloons of God and twist it and defile it he will now Medusa that was his own creation but there's a lot of beings in heaven there's many beings that have like a horse body and beautiful you know there's them is very beautiful they're not evil Satan took the image and made it evil so I'm gonna show you a couple of the pages now this one's very easily seen this is a real fire angel made out of guess what fire and he's a spirit she she's all spiritual being his arms don't come from his shoulders they come from his chest this is his arm this is his whole arm coming out of his body this is his head if you could look at this closer you could see his eyes his nose his mouth this is his wings right here his hair his wings he is walking on legs do you see the legs he's walking on the river in our city and in his hand he's carrying a deposit of the fire of God his name is Inferno and gentes picture it was right after our National Day of Prayer and all the wild intercessors got on a riverboat we wrote up a nun our st. Johns River and we would drop salt in the water salting it and we said on purpose this is to make way to cleanse the water for the fire of God to come and then God sent it so about a month later after that event he showed up on the river we were going over to visit my sister on the other side of the river and he said don't go the way you normally go go this other way or you're gonna miss what I'm gonna send in the sky she's a photographer I'm driving I have to say Jen took this picture I took a lot of them but she did take this one and we were we are miles dropped off when we came over we were on the Express system we came over this part down under where this is this bridge is three miles long as a three mile long bridge that connects to the other side of our city he was walking on the water not not standing he was we got about eight pictures of him and he was kind of white then he started getting more and more fire in him and people were going crazy they were pulling over I mean many pictures got this people got this picture so this is this was one of not the very first one but one of the best that was in 2009 and so I'll show you another one we'll have them back there now these are all army members these are not any of gabriel's I don't have any pictures of Gabriel's I've drawn them I painted them I don't have any pictures god I'm purpose connecting me to the army and so I'll show you another one just kind of passing around here some of them if you ever see something the sky looks like a dragon it's an Eragon they belong to heaven if God told me their name I know what their name is this one right here is there's a whole group there angels are made in tribes both on Gabriel side the first tribes were hid in heaven they weren't angels he made them in tribes because they had a defined purpose every tribe had a defined purpose and this one is the guardian angel over the state of New York his name is Excalibur can you see his face very clearly in the back can you see it oh thank you yeah he looks like a lion you see his mouth up and you can see his Mane yeah he's part of the tribe of the Royal Guard they all look like lions you've seen a lot of lines in the sky it was these guys right here and they do look like they look like lions and they guard the Royals because you are kings and priests into your God so that is their defying purpose they come to guard those who will rule and reign with Christ so that's that's the Royal Guard I also have ones that transport troops from heaven at pictures of the troops of heaven have pictures of one that goes into as covert and he he videotapes the actions of darkness and he goes right up to Michael's throne Michaels building he has one eye okay this is this is that angel its name is scout because he's a scout he goes behind the lines you should be able to see the one big eye it's right here you see a mark on that angel see that mark next to his eye it's a mark like a tattoo God marks the enemy stole it that's God's thing he marks them with different marks and this one right here is literally going like this looking and watching activities of Hell's army who are clueless to what they're doing they are absolutely clueless and so he's standing in a cloud in his wings or other army members of the hosts to protect them from any attacks of the enemy and so God has really good plans so this is a scout host of hosts of heaven with one eye right here if you could see a close you could literally see a face on the eye it records and this is something he asked us to create we didn't choose to do it ourselves I'm gonna show you another one oh we actually entry on here like here a roll up your Raptor rug and roll up you're out for rock and in here we have things like don't forget to ask for grace for today and then we have special days we put a special days in here we don't have Halloween so sorry we took it out we took liberties we don't have holidays from other false religions either so get used to it and so then we put statements at the bottom each the Holy Spirit gave us you must choose to be chosen you know that thing God many are called but few are chosen is because they didn't choose to be chosen you choose it you choose to be chosen this one is one of the best ones we have his name is Rex yeah it's it's me do you see his face he looks like a lion he's high up in the command of the Royal Guard really high up he's got wings that come from his neck my son-in-law likes to say he has horns and I want one no he didn't really have horns those are wings and I can't do this as well so my turn around this is one wing and this is another one and there's eyes lining there's eyes in all these wings eyes he has the eye on the end of his beard this is his moustache can you see his moustache it's long isn't that people say do angels have beards and mustaches the answer is yes you can see them right here he's holding a scroll on his hand can you see the scroll this is the scroll has a face it's a living scroll his name is Justus that scroll was dropped inside of me I had to say yes because I was said during the time when when we would command and the scrolls name is Justus and God said that he would read himself to me would that bother you've got to ask you that what would you say that's well I actually had to say yes my husband was with me somebody who never sees angels he's got five layers of a soul he's Scottish he's like a mountain he can't be moved anywhere he just belong to Jesus but he was with me when this beam came in over five storeys of condos and when spiritual beings come in the physical realm they flatten they come in and then they open up we have pictures of him flattened coming in we had pictures of him fully open we have pictures of him just waiting and then I asked the Holy after I got nuns screaming and yelling my husband's like oh something's coming in that was his whole statement something's coming in I'm like I'm excited I'm so excited wonder what he's here for a wonder what he wants and so I saw the spirit what is he here for was he's got orders from headquarters during the army from heaven for you to command and I said what I do he says you have to say I receive the scroll so I said I received it he dropped it and went inside of me and I said well whatever do he said nothing it'll read itself to you scrolls in heaven books in heaven read themselves to you so this is normal for heaven this is what happens when you live supernatural this is what happens when you choose to live the way God designed you to be amen and so we have heard him say one word and there's another picture after this I don't have that with me but after he dropped the scroll out of this this rift this deep blue is heaven right there that's heaven and when I said yes and you dropped inside of me out of these came two more beings one had a shofar one had a trumpet they began to blow them because God was signifying something the earth was going to command the army and so that's what that signified if I had said no it might have changed things or he would have found someone else I wasn't willing to do that amen so I have that picture you literally see these beings one looks very ancient he's got a long beard his eyes a rectangle and he's got a shofar the other one has a trumpet trumpet he's just got like a big like a I can't remem what you call those things capes or woods whatever you want to call that he had something like that and they were there celebrating then they were gone like that so we had a very little time I said I'm taking pictures I don't know about you I'm taking pictures to get some pictures of it so this is what's in this calendar and every month it has something to encourage you and the hosts make toast may the hosts go with you we say that to people all the time stand up stand out be dangerous against hell but this is not your normal calendar okay and over here what we know about that being we will tell you if we know something about it right there will tell you and and on the back he had us actually we couldn't hide who we are I said you're gonna show who you are so this is about a company one quest international tells you what it is there's me there's Margaret and then we have another page you said you're also going to show the creative team I sent all this through so people know who helped to create it because I don't do everything by myself there I am there's our our very funny English guy there's Jan okay in about two weeks we had it done do you ever work in any kind of marketing or creating that's that's definitely that's a heaven thing we stayed up we traveled we worked on it in the hotel room the hardest part was was picking out we just put all these pictures out everywhere we took them with us and then and God gave us what to say push back darkness I mean this whole thing is about God it's all about heaven it's about God's time on the earth and there's a there's others so there's one for each month in here and people go what the years have to over yet but they're not done this is about a time it's about a time like God counts event by events this is an event that God had picked scrolls were literally open and heaven unlocked and open so the host could work with us to fulfill their destiny that they were created to war for us so that's my introduction and we will have some back there if we if we know the name some look pretty fierce but these guys war you think about they war just like a military they're warring for you they fight for you literally for you for your family they'll keep the darkness as long as you're not bringing in your home they'll keep it out of your home amen and so these are some of our products our cups this is just our book cover of book 1 that's what that is and eventually we'll have whole sets of cups made like with some of the hosts on them that you can get you can go to revealing heaven dot-com and they'll all be on all those will be online yeah our phone numbers on our website you can call it if you can't find something you can call it and so um yeah our events are planned for specific purposes that we have our own there to train people to be prepared to be a part of a move of God like we have for the first time we're going to be training whether Warriors at our event at the end this next weekend actually it's called heavens invitation and we've had every year since we've been going and now we're adding weather warriors as one of the whole days to be trained how do you train how you learn too because you know Jesus already knew all that when he was asleep in the boat he already knew he could do that he was hoping the disciples would learned from him and yet what did they do there they're in terror for their own life there's a lord of glory on the boat with him and he's sleeping I'm sure you wanted to say why didn't you handle it when he learned to multiply the food he was training them the whole time why didn't you multiply food we can go and buy it we can't fine well why didn't you multiply it I mean disciples he wanted them to learn what he did why don't you traveling through the spirit realm will fill up God it Philip did as a lifestyle it was so normal for him he just did it you don't try it you do only purpose and focus and you keep doing it and something is going to happen and he doesn't care if you're ninety nine or nine it's what you choose what you decide you want but wherever you don't don't reject it sometimes it's Jesus just taught them something he didn't say what do you want this or not he just did it it's up to you if you do it or not amen and this new time we're living in the earth where we will demonstrate the power of the Living God we're not waiting on that time we're in that time you weren't here the last time I was here I just got back from Reno where I walked on the air who wants to do that be passionate about it I didn't even walk on water first I know Jesus said the books I did you will do and greater works you will do I jumped right into the greater works you know why that happened because I was violently passionate about something I had just hit my foot under stone and I roared this should not have happened to me I will not tolerate this again your word says that the angels will catch me up so I don't even - my foot on a stone I will never do that again and so next the week after I'm in Reno and between the green room and where we were there was a drop-off this big I walked right off of it I didn't even think I didn't know I was walking in here but I had said that and this the floor of a stone that was really humor I think on their part I said it wouldn't - stop and literally I don't know if they caught me I don't know what they did I don't know what they did I just know I didn't hit it I didn't fall on it I didn't hit it my foot didn't get dashed my head didn't get - it was like so high I would have fallen my whole body would have been I just walked like it was nothing I'm just doing the father's business right the pastor's in front of me walking and talking and I'm just walking and talking behind him and gents are shelling you're floating in air and what no I'm not I had my iPad or holding my iPad and I'm just talking to the pastor she says yes you are yes you are you know I thought she was playing a joke on me or something so I just keep walking I'm walking I walked out about 6 foot she goes you are walking on air why don't you look down so I'm walking outside I went I threw my iPad and I was there for about three more seconds just so he knew I would never forget that I was walking out here and I just went down really slow I began shaking Jen we were shaking and the pastor owns what just happened jingles she was flirting and he's a really good friend he said that's awesome will you do it out in the congregation why you just walk off that platform sweetie I want you to walk out that place son the whole time I'm when I first looked down and went wow it was this like walking on water and the father said oh no Jesus could feel the water he knew water was there didn't have anything to do but he said he could feel the water you couldn't feel the air no I couldn't say that's a greater work okay and he said well I'll get used to it until everybody they better start getting used to it everybody say I receive it this is definitely a different time we can't we can't think the same if you stay in your old mindset that's where you'll be when you either die and go to heaven or get raptured if you're gonna live for a couple hundred more years you'll probably get raptured if not then you're probably just going to go there and I've been shown a lot in the future and we're just starting into something so powerful the next 50 years will be so powerful on this very powerful I have grandchildren that are already being caught up to heaven it will be normal for children to visit heaven normal especially if their parents are believers it's gonna be normal he describes it all the time things that I've seen that I never even told him about okay he was three when it started rota volcano or the lava of a volcano with my father who lives in heaven and with Jesus huh he'd never met my father he called him grandpa but my dad looks 25 and he said and he gave me some Mary Janes he didn't know where Mary Jane was maybe somebody's you don't know either my dad's favorite candy in heaven he was giving him candy what do grandparents do they give candy so they still get to heaven he was with him and they were gonna ride this volcano and he was telling his mom all this and she said you better get over here right now get over here I said what did you expect what's gonna happen and so he's telling me all this Indy goes you know what and a three year old would not know even how a volcano was well he said there was lava it was red it was like kind of burning like and he said you know this mount was really cool grandpa took us straight up the side of the mountain no wheels on his car we we just kind of glided up to the top in the mountain we jumped off and went inside the volcano he said you know what my mom he said that would have burned anybody else to death but because of my god we didn't burn we wrote on and it was a fun ride and he you know what he's seven now and it hasn't stopped he'll preach to anybody anything he talks to his army he asked for grace every day and he looses stuff from his soul they don't ever have meltdowns in their car because as soon as they can talk she teaches him how to ask for credits this is our life this is this is our life this is how we're supposed to be living we're not from this world we live here worse we'll be acting like the world we come from amen so it's already starting it's already starting you know I have three daughters they see they hear I told them they had two and they're a girl might you won't sin because you don't get a choice I'm not letting you guys not letting you he said he needed holy seed in this earth and I gave up myself to get married and have you hi this is their conversation when they're little just looking at me I expect you to do greater things than I do and my grandchildren will be even greater so you will have nine children [Laughter] people don't tell you kiss him it's better than the screaming telling there'll be nothing in their dumb they never thought they were that they never thought they were those things and if someone told me they said oh no I'm not I belong to Jesus Christ one day when we had everything we owned taken away from us not our fault thrown out of our home we packed everything up we picked our kids up in a moving van and my daughter who is 16 said to me what an adventure with God I cannot wait to see what is he gonna do with us I am so excited she's 16 raise him up in the admonition of the Lord train them up in the gifts that God gave them and they'll never depart from those gifts the advance had never stopped they never ran in the world I'm serious never ran in the world trying to figure out who they were they knew they were dancers that was what he made them it was their passion from the time they were three four and eight that's all they ever did they didn't want to be something else they knew they were a gift sent from heaven and that's the gift they were every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of you were those lights why would he say that why would he put that in the same thing why would he say that together every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights you were the lights your spare man's made out of light you were a gift he sent you it's not that hard that's God to give you revelation I want you to enjoy your life I want you to celebrate your life you choose every day to be happy you're not happy there's no excuse to not be happy you don't have to keep that junk in you so stand up we're gonna do it I know you've done it again we're gonna do it i'ma pray over you and I'm gonna let you go amen I know there's new people here if you don't know about a soul checkup it's a lifestyle it is a lifestyle it will keep you so full of God so happy so inspired it opens up portals of heaven over you you get witty ideas and inventions you can even share it with others to help them because you have a will you can do this you have a soul he gave it to you you decide to use it or not using I'm not forcing anyone you say yes or no you do it or you don't do it it's really easy because almost everything God ever gave us is some he talks to me like I'm eight he doesn't give me big words he doesn't give me any long you know any long definitions on stuff he keeps it really simple that's why eight-year-olds can read my book and if they follow me and they come to a meeting they won't want their own they don't want to share it with their parents and their parents we'll play there's over 400 hours of me speaking on YouTube a lot of them played me all night long and those kids love it they wander no truth they want to know who God is no one can tell them there's something else because what you fill yourself with you will become amen so this is so simple you're gonna choose with your will to do this first you're gonna choose and say I choose my will to lose from my soul and then I'll give a list of most things that people have in their souls if I don't say something you can say it yourself you can also lose soul ties you made with other people that didn't treat you nice so good you can loose them from your soul then when we're all done because I see Jesus come down and he pulls things out of you literally it's like grey matter he pulls it out and then you bind things of God and they come in waves each thing you say it comes in a wave and I feel it go through me and through everybody here like the love of God the life I feel it comes like a wave so here we go are you ready you say as a child of God I choose with my will to lose from my soul all anger and wrath all hate all critical harsh judgmental words whether they were spoken to me or I spoke them I choose to lose from my soul all witchcraft whether I watched it read it or practiced it or anyone practice it around me I loose it i loosed from my soul all addictions from a person a place or a thing I will not keep any of them they will no longer control me in any way I loose from my soul any in all violence whether I watched it whether I read it whether I spoke it or someone spoke to me I also lose all traumas whether I experience violence or abuse of any kind or a witnessed it I loose all of it in Jesus name I loose from my soul all sadness all oppression depression and all despair any suicidal thoughts I loose them all in Jesus name I loose from my soul all sickness or disease are spirits of infirmity anything that is terminal in my body all emotional pain physical pain or mental pain I loose it all in Jesus name I loose from my soul all confusion any confusion any strife of any kind I will not keep it I lose from my soul all fear of any kind I will not be fearful in any way at least from my soul any lack any poverty mentality any mishandling of money I loose it from my soul I loose it from my soul all darkness I will not participate I will not tolerate and I will not advertise darkness of any kind at least from my soul and also ties there were negative abusive critical hateful or controlling I sever them and loose them from myself and Jesus name I list from my soul any books of other religions I will not keep them in myself I will not allow them to control my will my mind

team fire team you'll notice people throughout the house with tags like this fire team tags we want to minister to you and these are people who have been specially annoyed especially chosen within the house so they can pray with you and pray for you if you have a need seek someone out we're more than happy to minister to you after service will probably be the ones to be ministering to you but we just don't want to have everybody ministering to everybody because we want to make sure you're guarded we want to make sure that that's done in a special way and it's done with an anointed in presence of the house and what god's doing here tonight so we ask that you do that again when we let our hair down and do this you're welcome to come up and worship and really let it go uh wash the flaggers

win this is a part of time appointed by me from heaven earth this night i light a flame on the top of this mountain it will never be put off for you have stood to adversity through the lies to the accusations through the control the demands of man you have worshipped me you have not forgotten my son you have not forgotten what he's done you will be blessed and you will never stop being blessed for i am the god of everybody and the god of everything i'm about to shake this earth great exposure of the darkness matter what people or the fake news or the lying liberals have said about me or this time they don't know anything [Music] if they do not stop they will lose everything their words will become dust and blown away like they were never there for i say this is a time of greatness of acceleration you've never known are the manifested sons and daughters to come forth to demonstrate to manifest my power my love my plans the devil has plans he will fail and he will lose again and again and again and again and again and again [Music] for i have already said i will be in the white house for 24 years there is no one on this earth in this earth under this earth that can stop it from happening for i will have these days on the earth the great days the great days of knowing there is a god that he speaks that he sears sees and hears if my prophets do not prophesy what i say they will not have a voice until that season is over for these are not the days of doom and gloom these are not the days of the rapture the perilous times the tribulation they're times of greatness of the fire and the glory sweeping over this earth touching everyone crushing the darkness and pushing it back for i am cleaning the stage wiping it clean are the enemies camp are the enemy's people are the enemies dust [Music] for i will have my way my son made a way i will not ignore what he has done and i will not have a weak pathetic testimony of his sacrifice no one says when he is coming back but me and i am not ready for i will set you on fire and you will demonstrate like no one has before in all of history the powerful things of god to speak to the land the sea in the air and it will move do not tolerate evil and do not participate with it you choose life or death because they're apparently out there right now always choose life for when you side with those who want death of the unburned you will never win you will never succeed or complete your destiny you will repent because i bring life and life abundantly but you must choose it and if you choose it you must live it get out of the gray area stop riding on the fence for i hear those who've humbled themselves whose heart cries out for more but this time you get to bring them more i said it would be my sons and daughters who did it there is no age for them whether it's three or 153 you choose for if you sit on the side and do nothing that's what you will have a boring life an unfruitful life be bold and step out let people know what you believe and who you believe they'll come beating your door down to find out about your god not the false gods who have no life not the lies of the enemy he thinks he can take my country for it is mine i created it i called it into being i had people fight for it and die for it in the seasons past you've died to live for me but it now you will live and not die if you choose was it what is it to you if i keep you until my son returns be strong be excited and celebrate the victory even before it happens [Music] do not listen to the doom and gloom that does not come from me but fearful hearts that don't know what time it is they don't know what my plans are and they want to escape run your race but run it with me for i'll be right beside you and i will open the eyes of many and they will see me and they will know their god those who have stood and been faithful even under attack even though things were taken from you do you not think i can give you a hundred times more than what you had it is my desire to bless you it is my desire to be with you for there are times there are only in the power of my hand and these are some of those times listen to what is true where there is no confusion and nothing hidden don't believe the lies of those who live in sin and say they live and speak for me some have removed from the earth [Music] i won't allow their testimony of who i am to be here many who are lying cheating and stealing and even killing will lose not just their state but their life this is a holy time but it is a time to celebrate heaven celebrates with this time live on earth like they live in heaven but you have to be willing and obedient the host will not listen to those to be commanded by those who do not speak the words of my son nor have him in their heart not just as their savior but as their king many kings will come forth in this time for my son is the king of spiritual kings and the lord of spiritual lords and the spirit there is no difference between male nor female both can rise to that position of authority and dominion but you have to pursue it [Music] and if you want my thoughts you better walk in my ways and you better say his will his way not his will man's way i'm about to consume this country and people will come here to find me not just the american dream some regions the light and the glory will be so great in people will drive their dead relatives in there they'll come to life neither sin nor crime nor sickness will be able to abide in those regions [Music] you are forerunners it is an honor and a privilege to be chosen if you're alive and you're breathing and you've given yourself to my son you are chosen know this night that your god has visited you and spoken his words to you if they don't light up with others then do not receive those words for i stand on my work and beside my son on my throne these are days we have talked about before you were ever born before the earth was made we spoke of these days why would i give them up if you buy a bible and it says it's my word and it's left parts out don't read it if it makes it easy to live to freely sin there's other gods beside me that can bring you to my home those are lies from hell for my word and my truth will make you free says your god a man [Music] [Music] oh can you hear me now [Music] i know there are people who will tell you that you cannot see the faces of god and live but even the one who spoke those words and they were written in the word saw the face of god john himself in the book of john said you cannot see the face of god and live but in the book of revelation in chapter 4 he was caught up he was in the spirit that's a place you walk in he's in a place on that day where he could hear no word of man on the isle of patmos at least that day unless he decided to walk off of it i chose to let him see things are different because he was in that place i could catch him up and stand before my throne with the living rainbow moving in and out of me with life moving in and out of me and he saw my face and never again after that did he say you cannot see the face of god and live for i have caught many up and showed many my face my plans but this one standing before you she is my revelator i will never stop taking her to heaven what business is it to you if i want to i held the air you breathe if i choose somebody who's been willing and obedient and laid down their life every time i asked why would i not trust her yes she's a woman and she's a king in the spirit she's not just my servant she is my daughter and it is my great pleasure to reveal her as my treasure to operate without measuring these days [Music] if you're willing to pay the price you think it's so easy to have to live a halfway normal life on this earth when you're so connected to me in heaven she does not see things like you see them but she will reveal everything i show her and will not be afraid of the face of man even hell trembles when she speaks [Applause] everyone should be dangerous against hell [Music] it is evil and wickedness that tries to consume your country but i will not tolerate it for my people have humbled themselves they have repented of their wicked ways and i will heal their land [Music] for i hear everyone and i see everyone nothing is hidden from me when i look at the earth i rejoice i remember when my son and i made it we made it to kerry the glory the power the wonder a stopover station before you come home i know your trials i know your test if you fall down get up [Applause] tell the enemy you will no longer tolerate him in your life that means you will not tolerate his images his words his frequencies his songs you create a habitation for heaven in your home and it will come you will see angels coming and going for you are in a new season the season of the high call of god of your god why did you not expect for things to be exposed before every great thing was done hell always acted up but this time the exposure is for your benefit these are not new things they've always been here you just never knew it i'm pulling away every closed door basement building things hidden in the wilderness things hidden in the forest even things hidden underground i will expose it all [Applause] the lives of those those who want to stand and run your country but hate me hate life even hate the people they want to govern it will not happen [Applause] for i will shake them and nothing will be hidden but openly shown and dealt with even those have already been in power and think they've gotten away with it they will not trump may not be perfect but he gives me permission to be in this country from the highest office in the land he has welcomed me and prayed to me and made friends with my pastors my prophets my teachers my evangelist his closest friends are my sons and daughters but the world would reject them and hate them there are many people in this world praying for your president even they love him even they recognize the good in him the authority in him he will help to shift many leaders of many governments so i can shape that nation and he will sweep his platform clean one day to make room for pence i have heard words spoken against my vice president and i am not happy he is a godly man who is not afraid of anything he is a strong tower to temper your president he will win two terms also [Applause] for i have written that in my book and what my book says it will happen not maybe happen [Applause] whoever he picks to be his vice president will then be president for eight years after him by that time there'll be no opposition that will even have a voice to speak [Music] [Applause] america will be a great light to this world it is my gift to this world who allows my son my greatest gift to operate in this world get ready because the show is beginning [Applause] [Music] there's coming a day when people will step into a store thinking they're going to buy something and they will step into my glory and begin to cry out to know me [Music] satan knows about these days but he was hoping he could stop them this is a place of freedom liberty and justice for all it is also a place for righteousness and holiness that your amazing forefathers heard my voice and made plans for it the enemy has always been afraid of america don't be afraid even if you come home you'll be with me there is no fear not even in death you just step from life to life [Applause] if your family live here they're the most blessed people in existence make plans to be great because it is time for i will pour out my spirit on all flesh children will begin to pastor at age five [Applause] children are the easiest to reach because they don't question and they don't reason and they don't let their mind get involved that's why i said you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom you have not because you asked not but those who've asked already will surely get what they have asked for it is a new time on the earth a miracle will be an example but many countries will run to the light and to my son for there is a habitation coming that will not end until i say it will [Applause] end rejoice that i have shown these things and spoken to you of these things for those are my plans the more you believe it is real the more real it will become there's coming a day very soon that when you come here the glory will be waiting portals are being opened everywhere for heaven to pour in but also for blessings to pour in those who say i cannot speak through the voice of a man or mankind don't know me make sure you laugh laughter is the language of heaven but profanity is the language of hell don't let those words be in your mouth in your home allowed to enter into your home guard your soul and the souls of your children by not letting anything pass through any form of media it will be a trap of the enemy and what you've given permission to come will come if you say good morning to me every morning you'll be saying it before my throne you command the day by what you choose when you first wake up choose life and love my power my presence extreme discernment and get understanding these days will come quickly and your life will change day by day so all who hear this message if you are my son or my daughter if you have received my son and repented of your sins these words are for you do not walk around with your head held down but lift it up where your help comes from even if people laugh they will not be laughing for long term pray for those who have chosen the darkness and are expecting it to win some will take their life when they lose because their souls have been compromised by the lies they've been listening to guard well the layers of your soul what you put there and always choose life i love you says your god amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] oh it is hard to stand i won't fall i'm sure my angels are behind me i don't want a stool what is that no no but we could just lay hands on everybody and end it [Music] it's pretty pretty hard to top god and for those of you who don't think this is real may he come to you [Music] when i walked in the angel of the lord who looks just like jesus came in behind me to make sure i wouldn't fall down before i got up here and god's been speaking to me like the last several hours before i got here and some people think why is she late why is she late well are you going to turn around and say no to god i was right on time god was very wise calling me a revelator instead of a prophet because he knew all the bashers wouldn't know what a false revelator was [Music] [Applause] he was very detailed with me before i started traveling and speaking and he'd already warned me about a lot of stuff that would happen or would be said which i understand people don't understand what they don't know or they have not experienced their self it is hard for them to receive it seeing is not believing receiving is believing god has given me many titles i didn't ask for any of them and many people say i want to be you i go no you don't you don't really and i've heard people say he chose seven men before he chose you no he didn't he did choose me he knew me when i was in him he knew every one of you already knew what you would become and on your soul that he created he wrote if he would be male or female no matter how man says how that happens and your soul will be conflicted if you're told you're something else because your soul already knew what it was supposed to be but if the ones who wanted to take over have their way they would let anybody choose whatever they want to but god has a plan you were with him before you came to this earth before this world was made before he stretched out the universe the physical realm over the spiritual realm that's why when it says in revelations he will roll it up he knows where the ends are he had to put something out there that he could put physical things on because all he had the original realm is the spiritual realm the unseen realm unless he lets you see it from the time i was little i was a seer i saw the good guys and the bad guys i saw activities at the spirit realm you hear people talk about angels and demons there's much more than that all around you there's buildings built that both sides use depending on what is going around in that area there's platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places how do they get in high places they earn it by hunting for souls for the enemy these are wicked spiritual beings however when you learn to command an army that was created to pull down every stronghold of satan they're the ones who war against hell no matter what level of wickedness they operate in they can shred those platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places and they go through light buzz saws and they can't stop it from happening because we who have the flesh you're the ones who have authority in the earth every spirit would be coming from hell trying to take over they use people like they apparently are right now but they cannot do it they can't the earth is made for men and those who receive jesus christ you're called to rule in the spirit realm when you take authority and dominion in the spirit realm it then in packs and packs this physical realm and because we haven't known how to do it to his fullness satan has just taken all he wants to done what he wanted to kill who he wants to put fear in who he wants to we're not tolerating it anymore jesus clearly said the things i did you will do and greater things you will do than i did so you should be trying to stop the storms we can help you do that you can either email or call our office and ask for weather warrior information that's god's name that he gave for this group who's willing to step out and just do what his son did i didn't pick that name we are to take authority over any form of destructive weather and whether you know it or not in the word of god when he made the ocean and he made the land he told the ocean i set a boundary right here at the land and you will not pass over that's god's word that's his decree we are his sons and daughters it is our job to uphold that and tell those storms you will not cross over on the land or do destruction he created the weather to nourish the earth not to damage it so we sit down here and say god come and rescue us come and stop this and he's looking down saying i gave you authority you have authority you rule because the enemy knows he can get in and twist any of those weather system and use them the best he can because he comes to what kill steal destroy and one of the ways he does that is with the weather so our volcanoes are not supposed to be erupting tsunamis are not supposed to be destroying none of that stuff that's going on but there's been no voice or agreement in the body that they would no longer tolerate that he taught the disciples how to multiply food how to travel in the spirit realm how to take authority and dominion over all the power of the darkness cast out any and all demons to pray for the sick to be healed why are we tolerating the virus because i'm not it has no right here the body needs to wake up stand up and step out you can wake up all you want to he wants you to do all of those things and i can tell you right now the meteorologists don't know what's happening they're going wild we even have some of their briefings where they talked about what is wrong with this weather they're almost afraid to give a forecast of anything because it never happens and then they faked it they faked it to prove these things were happening those weren't even the storm that was going on those in the area that the storms are headed to have the greatest authority if you're a believer so those on the east coast we have melt we have built a wall and if you go back and look at every storm that's come after dorian when we told it we all started saying you will not and cannot cross over the boundaries god set for you and all the way down not just in florida where we started it all the way up the east coast believers were standing there saying you will not cross over and do destruction and every time a storm comes you can go look at it it comes a certain way then it hits the wall and goes back out and they don't understand it's simply the body of christ taking authority so when we learn oh hawaii has got it down we have a lot of friends there's a lot of weather warriors that live in hawaii it doesn't even get started before they get out there and they start i'll never forget the time that this massive like i think was category five was coming and i had been teaching and talking to him about taking authority and we all declared that this storm will not be allowed to come ashore and the head of it would be taken off and when everyone went to bed except me because i don't sleep at night when they all went to bed when they woke up there was nothing but shreds left and they couldn't understand or get it they knew for sure that the the island would be consumed and those people those weatherboards in hawaii would not let up that prayer of agreement we had they said we don't know how it happened but it looks like the head was taken these are the meteorologists saying this the head was taken right off [Music] it was a nothing and one reporter said never in 25 years of being a meteorologist i ever see i never saw that happen i'm still trying to go back over all the tapes all the information that we've accumulated to know exactly what should have happened and it didn't happen why because they're not tolerating it so whoever lives in the gulf better start stepping up is not coming to florida i live there and i'm not putting up with it anymore [Applause] you need to just get fed up what yes whoever has the fires in your state you better start saying you're not tolerating it anymore you come into low pressure system to form and come in and put the fires out [Applause] that is not something new in the bible they called forth rain to come and they begin to see the clouds form did it come and did it rain why are we any different than them it's called believing your faith and guess what in heaven you'll need your faith not to pay your rent not to be healed not for any of those things but to begin to create who is our father do you know in the bible when it says let us make men in our image that's what they look like like with the glory on them the light of god on them but after our likeness is how they operate we're supposed to operate like them we are not god you don't want to be god i don't want to be god i've seen a lot but i still don't want to be god no one's that many kids the devil actually isn't god's problem it's how we all pray and stand against them he should be running does it say he will run from us do you remember that scripture you submit yourself under the hand of god and resist the enemy what will he do he will flee from you he's talking to you you do you know the word resist doesn't go oh no no i don't know what there's something i will not tolerate you you're a liar and a friar and i serve the most high god only him and he'll run there are people the demons beg not to be assigned to because when they come back and they're not successful with their assignment they get punished the devil doesn't give anybody rewards not even his own he just punishes them when they don't listen so they don't want to they'll lie they'll do anything they can they don't want to and by the way when you learn to release the anointing they burn on and it hurts they'll burn if they get near the fire of god it will burn them like it's going to melt them they may live in hell's fire they don't want god's fire that's why baptism in fire is coming [Applause] see i was raised on the word of god god chose when my birth would happen on this earth he chose my fathers my mothers by the way my mother is here tonight she'll be 90 next april she had 15 children i am number three and my sister's number 15 right there and any of them could testify to anything i am saying i never was normal i didn't want to speak to people even though i was i didn't want to speak to people i didn't want to hug them i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you know my little nice apartment somewhere and do big business he took me out of my world of business yeah it's like he didn't know he needed paychecks seriously he did this he always told me before he would do something with me my grandmother was my dad's mother was a powerful woman of god she was in the jungles of panama and was afraid of nothing ever she'd come to our home on sabbatical i mean we had more kids than anybody she could have come any anywhere i don't remember she had eight or nine of her own our aunts and uncles so she had a lot of children but she always came to our house because god was there we knew she could see through the walls we knew she could see right inside of us and every time she came she'd lay her hand on her head you will serve and know the most high god and my brother would run and hide i'm not going to be a missionary and be eaten by the alligators or crocodiles no right now they lock them on death row to minister to death apprentice prisoners he's invited by hell's angels to come and do funerals i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles anymore my mom would tell me every day you are so strange i don't know what god's going to do with you i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day my whole life i would know things my siblings didn't care too much for that my dad was a great mentor but his own mother in the jungles of panama on her own they had a murderer loose in the village i know some of you heard the story before but it just shows you who she was she was on the mission field in the little hut somewhere where she was ministering and she i think she lived there for i forgot how many years many years and everybody was boarding up their windows to keep this murder from out she left her window open and she went to sleep right in front of the window because guess what she knew god sure enough late at night here comes a foot in the window and this huge machete coming with him and she turn around look at him and she goes freeze in jesus name and rolled over and went back to sleep and three hours later when the police arrived he was still frozen [Applause] that was my grandmother i was taught to never be afraid i knew there was a god i knew there was his son i knew there was holy spirit who is my best friend that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a day that's what that means let me speak to you 24 hours a day but lots of times he's tweaking you he wouldn't warn me something's going to happen i don't think i'd do that that's what he says to me i don't think i'd go there so i'm not going to go there okay i don't ask him why but you have to have your ears open to listen and it's really good idea if you say i choose holy spirit to give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention it is one of the most powerful things you can say anybody here let's just say it together holy spirit from this moment on i give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention so be it there you did it i did that when i was really young it saved me a lot let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen she'd come up here now she would preach all the time she knows that's true because he does the same thing with her every morning it's called living a new life heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a lifestyle so if you want to live on earth as they live in heaven you need to learn to live heaven culture what is that how they live in heaven and living the same way on the earth they're free of fear free of lack free of grief free of anything of the enemy never sick they go well they're in heaven yes they are but our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come by the way that is heaven your kingdom is heaven you're speaking to the father right your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven that is heaven culture you are literally praying a prayer that asks for heaven culture and he's released it on the earth you choose it you lose everything under your soul that's not him every trauma from the past every wicked evil disgusting vile movie you've ever watched with your eyes it's in your soul that's why he says to guard it for out of it will flow the way you live your life as a man think it's in his heart which is your soul not talking about your human beating heart the heart also means the core or the center of something that's your soul that's what you are you are a living soul and what you fill it with is what you will become that's why people you've known all your life kind nice people i know some of them who now hate with a hate i've never seen before in people they hate and despise don't even know why why they listen to the fake news and for years they have filled their layers you have layers whatever you feel the most of is what you're going to begin to act like so if you don't like you change what you're watching even what you say goes in your own soul so if you don't like you you've been telling yourself that for years and you put another layer of it in you and what's in there is what you will think about and if you think about it you're going to choose it if you choose it you're going to do it again that's called what criminals do this is true that's why a criminal will get out of prison go commit a crime and go back right back to prison if they've been there 20 years it'll you know why it's in their soul and i've been to prison to talk it's good to hear that and i had 80 prisoners and they had somebody guards trying to watch they never watched they listened to protect me my husband was with me sitting up here staring at every one of them but then even he was crying and i told them how they were sought out by the enemy even as a little child they had a great call on their life so he didn't want them to be loosed on the earth they might find out who they are and do destruction to his plans so he gets them into crime this is truth he gets them into crime when you do it it was in your soul then he makes sure they get caught and then they get put in prison where they can't be a threat to him so every time they get up because it's in them guess what they do it doesn't matter how much therapy they give them how many classes they take them to if they can't get it out of them they'll think about it they'll do it and then they're back in the same place so i told them the story of their life this is what you're doing this is why you're doing it this is what god had for you this is what satan is doing to you and will proceed to do it to every member of your family if you can then they begin to cry then they get furious you get mad at the devil then they get born again filled with the holy spirit then it teaches them how to war i teach them how to send heaven's army so now insider prisons are very dangerous people who are dangerous against hell i mean anybody could go to prison right but why are these people in rhythm they are dangerous because of their destiny and satan doesn't want them loose your soul is very important to you don't ever forget that you choose with your soul all day long you choose christ right after that you should choose what he chooses all day long you should guide what you choose what you watch what you say i love that little saying these half years what would jesus do what would he say what would he choose it's actually a very free life to not sin people get shocked when they say i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's not you choose not to you just say no say no to who was ever asking you sorry my soul is too important i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really think you were weird who cares because when they start to die they'll call you to pray for them they'll look for you if it's on their deathbed hey you know about heaven i need to go there don't forget they made fun of you that's why it's important that you not suffer trauma for 30 years after it happened you know who's doing that the devil because you saw it or experienced it and he will replay it and replay it stop the video stop it stop it stop it and lose it from your soul jesus and after your will because of jesus to lose it from your soul he'll come down and pull it out and it will literally be like it never happened to you i've seen too many people set free and they went from being you know in the drudges of despair suicidal they'd have these dreams every night about the torment or whatever it was the trauma they went through and three minutes with me and the revelation god gave me while their husband their pastor went in the store to get me some things to eat i was invited to speak his wife was set free she was a different person when he came out and then she brought her 17 year old and her 11 eleven-year-old sons to me because they were present when she was abused so much they lose out all their soul and they haven't never six years later have never had another nightmare or torment you can be free the truth makes you free and the truth is you can be free even from heroin from witchcraft homosexuality it doesn't matter what it is from the enemy you choose with your will to be free and yes we pray for people to be free from homosexuality which is a spirit and guess what they have powerful destinies every one of them the devil targets the ones who have the greatest destinies to bring freedom or liberty to people and he wants to keep them from doing that so he gets them distracted sidetracked on the wrong path filled with lies believing that's how god made them but remember when he made them he wrote on their soul this is who you are this is what you will be and he had plans for them from that moment i will tell you this there is a move coming to them and millions of them will get born again [Applause] [Music] not not not just a few millions he'll move on them they'll know who they will they'll know the entire time it was a lie and they will repent from it reject it completely and run into god's kingdom and they'll be great witnesses i will also tell you this millions of muslims are about to expect they will experience salvation god is still into saving people number one thing make sure you belong to him if you get saved at least you're going to have it a lot of people have it happen on their deathbed and the family member said i never saw it happen so you think it didn't happen did you believe they would be because the number one thing besides getting jesus you better believing that your family members will know jesus christ give their life to him and be with you in heaven there's a reason why you should do that you have the greatest influence in the spirit realm over their life as family members and jesus the first time he took me to heaven said there'd be so many in the earth to be shocked when they get there to see who's up there and yet they were the very one who prayed and believed for their salvation we have so many promises as a believer we as the body of will see an example a living walking breathing taking authority dominion releasing life to people and let them see you happy and joyful while you're doing it maybe they might want jesus one of the biggest things i know it will happen eventually the world will know us the body of christ by our what our love for each other stop fighting the plan of the enemy divide and conquer is his plan and in this whole last year several years before the virus it's not a plague and it is not a disease even in the natural viruses come and they go but people act like they are i'm not saying you can't protect yourself if you want to i'm not tolerating sickness or disease i'm not tolerating it every time you bless your food i hope you're blessing your food i won't ask for a show of hands my daddy let us eat after we blessed our food and then he added things the prayer went on forever i know where he got it from because when his mom came off the mission field she would have a 40-minute prayer at the dinner and she knew that open her eyes if you're going to leave the table and then she'd pray for you blessing your food is a very powerful thing because it says when you do that and you ask he will take sickness far from you [Music] so if you haven't been doing it do it that means he won't allow it to come to you or your home that's what you've got an interpretation he won't allow it to come to you or your home if you were declaring that when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes long but you know i added a few things i will hold my plate up in the restaurant or anywhere else look at father doesn't this smell good i'm going to enjoy every bite of it so bless it to my body and may the isis have a never-ending crisis may hell have triple trouble in hell as long as i'm alive i thank you for blessing all those who serve you who know you who love you amen so if we go out together after i'm invited and that pastor says will you bless the food who's ever with me will go okay and what are they gonna do here i'm picking up my plate are they gonna sit there and just stare at theirs lift it up everybody [Applause] i'm training you to bless your food that you actually can have food and actually can eat the food amen many countries can't do that but we can remember that the next time somebody asks you to say blessing i challenge you to do it do you know why because it was a day when i was in my late teens and i was saying my wrote prayer father thank you for this blessing he's in my body and what's wrong with his name my person thank you amen did you even hear those words and i literally heard from heaven this is before he started taking me i heard like a rubber stamp wham 500 billion 260 million 810 0001 can you say something else that we might actually be excited to hear he really said that to me so from that day i have never blessed my food like that it's a habit that's not a blessing that's not a blessing it's a habit right you need to get god excited father i thank you for this amazing food it smells good looks good i can't wait to see what you're going to do with me next i am so ready who cares what people hear at least they'll know there's someone around that knows god my little sister gave her famous blessing i think she was four or five and we were all not one of our other sisters i have eight sisters and seven brothers in an alligator named charlie but he's in heaven he doesn't have to live in a bathtub up but i've seen him in heaven your pets i'll go to heaven be nice to them they'll remember you and they'll talk [Applause] [Music] and i already hear some people's heads it's too late to tell me that's not true you haven't been there because if you did you would know that why not did you know that many animals actually have a spirit and a soul go back to genesis and read when noah back in the day when my meetings would be six hours long i'd do three or four i was just like like this and i would call let's see i called them i have called noah moses and adam and then one time i called him noses because my head was so tired i couldn't remember and every time i did that everybody emailed me i don't think you know who actually put people on the ark and then we get phone calls and they go yeah she knows she blew what okay she knows this is moa and moses and noah because you know she couldn't really remember if you go back and read that you know what i'm telling this is what the father told me this is how he taught me like a little kid because when i go to heaven i'm like eight years old with pigtails and he actually talks to all of you like children man is the one who likes to expound and make things totally not even understandable or approachable but god doesn't talk to us like that so he talked me said i'm going to teach you something and why because i'd seen pets in heaven and i'm like wow there's every one of my pets they were in this long line and they were on my father's ranch in heaven and they started with sally the pig and i got i got corrected because i said there was pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the pig he was a family pet gave him to my father when he was tight for the ministry it was this big when it died it was 1100 pounds i saw her in heaven and her were two little mice that we had in new york city when you were allowed to have pets they lived in the wall they were residents so we just kept them i recognized my brother joey's duck name max that he had when he was nine charlie the alligator that i've always talked about we all had in florida we live in florida and he lived in our bathtub and we had to take it out and clean the tub and he'd wander around the bathroom every goat bird fish snake lots of them spiders and iguana named iggy i saw every single one of them in heaven every one of them a long line as long as you see following my dad walking around on my dad's ranch and the father took me to the store and he said i need to explain this to you because people will argue and they're not god so they think they know better than me but if you go read the scripture in genesis where i told noah to put the animals on the ark and then he took me further you know even closer further away at the beginning of time when he made adam and it talks about how you know god the father and jesus were both there by the way the father said adam jesus stepped out of him that's what the word always did he stepped out and made his body but there was no life in him until he did one thing the father leans over because the father carries life he leaned over and breathed adam's spirit of life that was his spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual body into his nostrils and he became a living soul and i went oh yeah i've always known that he said but you didn't never connect it to noah go back and read this scripture in genesis and i did and do you know what it says that god told noah to put every animal on the ark that had a spirit of life in it you don't have to believe me believe the word that meant those creatures had souls and a spirit body oh that's from god i can't take credit that's how revelation happens it changes the way you think so people will argue with you it's too late it's in the word so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul i think they just they go die and go to hell with the flies they came from hell they can't have a soul right but i did learn that all your pets go to heaven and then when one would die i'd actually see my angel take his spiritual body and take it to heaven your own guardian angel takes your pet's spiritual body and takes it to heaven and they live in your mansion they will be eating at the table when you get there they will not be eating off the floor anymore so people go it doesn't say the word animals are in heaven it says creatures preach the gospel to who what to what i preached the gospel to every pe i had i was gonna make sure they made it creatures remember around the throne the living they have bodies like animals but they're not they're highly intelligent have always been with god like melchizedek who had no father no mother no beginning or ends there was more than father son and holy spirit i always say father word and holy spirit and so melchizedek has always been with him he is father's personal high priest thank you not one of adam's sons he's not a human that died and went to heaven he's always been with him i've seen a syllabus this big that tells you about um what is it what is that one thing they talk about well number one they always talk about the stone god will give you when you get to heaven and you always see on the syllabus a river rock with some big long name because he will give you a nickname the only he and you know and that white rock is a white diamond is not a river rock the word rock in heaven means gemstone because he's not cheap or poor right when when you get married you give your the toes a ring with a diamond in it or some beautiful stone right he's old bran so get ready for your pets to be in heaven amen and they'll be with you for all eternity so i keep telling people be nice to them they'll thank you for how often you let them out or fed them the food under the table you weren't supposed to why do you think they tried to eat it off of the table later when you're not there you spoiled them so when he said heaven is beyond anything you ever thought or imagined it is unless i like the word unless it be revealed by his spirit so the spirit of god is the one who catches me up all the time without warning me i fall in the driveway i'll go to heaven i'm in the grocery store reaching for something he takes me to heaven my family know because they'll come in to talk to me and there's nothing in me this my spirit man's in heaven holy spirit climbs and keeps my body alive my husband is so used to it of 43 years he'll come in and say something to me i don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't look down and watch what people are doing are you kidding i'm listening to what god is showing me but my husband will say these words oh i'll come back later he is he is scottish he's not moved by anything even as his wife's body is sitting there not breathing he is not concerned see he picked the right person for me i remember the first day he saw an angel walking down our hallway and he freaked out although i've talked about them thousands of times he actually saw one he's like nothing would come out i said oh did you see the angel he never doubted he just never you don't sit there and cry because he doesn't get to go he's happy i go and he's happy i speak don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll get a joke and it will be a scottish silk that you'll never get the ending to you'll never get the punchline but if you ever want to fish and catch big fish that is a gift god gave him when he sent him from himself he made him a fisherman that's his passion that's his greatest thing besides me and jesus and guess what i hate i hate fish let willy be free i don't want him in my freezer in my home in a frying pan or on my table they're slimy they stink they smell and i don't like i don't like them so if i went fishing he'd have to take it off he'd still be here the jesus game and i'm not touching that fish and do you think god knew this of course he knew it of course he gave somebody somebody with five layers in their soul that's like a rock and you aren't ever changing that man i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can say loves jesus he hears very clearly gives me words from god all the time a little scratches of paper but doesn't talk about it so he gave me somebody who doesn't care about talking or want to talk thank god right because we'd be wearing each other out i pray for people spouses want to see they both minister and they're wanting the microphone [Applause] i have no competition yeah well my sister kind of makes up for her the baby who said she'd never talk to anybody but but taught 15. uh-huh how many kids you haven't used to class 16 two-year-olds for about 15 years now she's braver than me i don't want to do that i don't want to catch fish and i don't want that either but she's really good at so that's why she's writing all the children's books and they're amazing our artist is every time he gets time he works on it every child around the world will know there is a heaven there is a god and what life is like there and the last place i was taken that was new was called whimsical way it's up in the celestial realm the sky of heaven and any little child who wants to in heaven either climbs into a bubble gets on the bubble train and takes him up to this amazing place parents don't have to go and they have all these creatures little creatures that are their friends and one day we'll they'll be part of our amusement park we've made so heaven has got lots of plans for kids fun you're probably one of the first congregations i told this to it was amazing these little creatures had names they were wearing clothes they were friends to these other kids and they would all go up there whenever they want to and play and play and play and have fun create little things and then they come back down because you live with your parents or your grandparents or whoever is the closest in relation to you when you get to heaven no child is left alone we should celebrate who we are that is your destiny and the new earth i get a lot of flack from that get over it you're not god he's going to make a and say new say new means new he's already remodeled this one several times already he has yeah and when you get to heaven everybody gets to see when he made it you all learn how he made the earth the first time how it got messed up in verse two think about it verse one verse two how did that happen so quick in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that means it was done say don imperfect then wine number two is it a mess why is the water on the land and the sky why is it trapped underneath all that stuff why is the earth all split up why is it in darkness the first one he didn't need the sun or the moon yet he made him yet no he lit it with his glory we should study the book of jeremiah he turned the light out at one time satan was making the earth a wilderness rick not me knows but really when he made it the first time it was perfect and he lit it with his glory there was no evil on the earth at that time and then of course you all know satan lucifer was cast out of heaven down to the earth and he thought he was going to take over he's tried so many times i don't know why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs became evil because they got possessed and used and i know people talk about i don't know where they get these things from reptilian seed because god made the donors dinosaurs not satan oh you don't even want to know about the reptile you don't need to know about okay it doesn't have anything to do with us man comes up with their own head knowledge and understanding of something and there are no nephilim on the earth right now i assure you there aren't any so there's too much really to talk about all that you've already got what you really needed when the first 15-20 minutes you have revelation that a lot of people don't know what's going to happen you heard like uh i know 24-year plan but really actually heard about a 50-year plan i've been taking over 100 years into the future and the earth was still here and it was good it was really good each generation until god is ready to stop things it'll get stronger they will manifest more they'll be in charge more and children will probably be the first ones who command a mountain to jump into the sea and if they want to put it back they will because we go from where this is not glory to glory glory to glory glory to glory this is us now glory to the pit glory to the pit glory to depression glory to lack glory to lack that isn't the way it goes it goes from glory to glory to glory that is an upward motion in authority in dominion in joy and celebration and the earth being well a hundred years from now it will be like that so forget stop trying to make plans to escape i don't want to escape i want to be here i'll be here the whole time and the people well jesus comes tribulation comes it's all over no it's not you don't know the bible because jesus gets he will get his thousand-year reign and god's not keeping that from him why would he he's going to sit on that throne in jerusalem and be king of the world for a thousand years and it's still not over because satan will be in a big pit oh yeah there will be no weapons on the earth during that thousand years people will live to be seven and eight hundred years old because christ is sitting on the throne and there'll still be people who aren't saved so that means people will make it through the tribulation the whole earth will not be destroyed in the tribulation and everybody won't be killed off the earth as there'd be no natural people for jesus to rule over when he sits on that zone in jerusalem at the end of the tribulation right yeah who's he going to rule who's he going to be in charge of and there'll be kings and countries that don't want him there can you believe that they must have the let's be unintelligent i'll be polite it's not what my flesh wanted to say they will be as unintelligent as the devil they will not want him and they'll know he's the son of god i mean he just wiped up all the all the wicked evil armies right he won like trump won not that he's god but look at him he won and he thought this is going to be easy breezy and never has every devil around come after somebody so harshly they hate him because he stands for justice liberty and freedom but they really hated him when he became really dangerous and said i'm fighting god back in january that was it that was it the devil went crazy he's not going to stay in that seat i'll impeach him i declare i'm incompetent other people rise up all over you know what they want a civil war here for a long time they want all of us to run the streets and kill each other and i've told them i've talked to them sometimes do you not understand a true american they actually want life they want a future they have a family they don't want your garbage go to a third world country and live if you want socialism go where they have dominism we're not going to have it here why the people don't want it [Music] you don't want it and they'll make it sound like it's amazing make it sound like it's beautiful go to venezuela they're living in dumpsters if they can find one that's what happens i grew up because of my natural age i've been through many generations of time on the earth i remember the turmoil of the 60s when people wanted to have nothing but love and or war then they didn't want to go to war they didn't want to do nothing i remember that but i also remember doing we would do these what do you call them when you have to do little see my earth mine doesn't work so well not projects it's when you would hide under your desk in case the russians are coming to get you anybody here have to do that you were practicing if you were going to be bombed by the russians what's called the cold war it's pretty cold on that floor under my desk and when i was like eight nine ten they all did it they'd they'd stop and they would let the alarm go everybody would just buy habit oh drop what you're doing crawl under your desk and hide in case the bomb would hit we lived like that until it was ended okay so you don't want to live in russia i've been there the sadness is so horrific i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go unsure i could feel it and see it like black clouds of evil and that i could feel with the people with a great deep sadness and grief that they had no freedom because if they take your weapons the criminals aren't going to give up theirs you wonder where their heads are right and who in the world wants to do well i know this is political well you have to give it up because tomorrow that's what you're really going to get god is very politically minded he doesn't want that he only wants that who in the right mind shows you they probably don't have one anymore wants to defund the police i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in california or washington or oregon or new york chicago i could just go down this list who in their mind having had no freedom for five months would vote in that same governor or the senators or the people who didn't care if their places were being destroyed where does that come from i promise you i won't tell you some things the president's going to do as soon as he gets reelected he'll be tweaking some governors i'll just say that much and some mayors and getting laws changed [Music] because people even the ones who voted him and don't want them now because they who won't allow are having all the freedom they want to do what they want to and they're openly showing what's in their soul that's the point of all this god is exposing the souls of people and they can hide and smile behind their big office but when it comes push to shove what's in that soul is coming out and people couldn't believe it when it started happening what is wrong with those people are they insane because their people don't have liberty freedom and there is no justice there is no protection there's no food there's no jobs people's houses get broken into when they want to do you know how many people i want to tell you how many people have moved to florida we are being crushed with people every day because they were seeing us on the news having liberty freedom and justice enjoying our beaches we were as good as we could be to work along with the quarantine but we had fresh air everywhere we went you could open your door and have fresh air and people saw that and went i'm not staying here no more so they're moving out and that should obviously we think would show the head of that person who's in charge they don't like this they're leaving that means no votes now no one's going to want to vote them back in you want to go through that again and no tax money you're right no tax money to take care of anything it's a mess it's all free if they say give it up give it all there give it all to us we'll just take care of you don't even think that's what's going to happen you gave away your destiny your future your home your rights your rights your rights your rights ask what satan wants but he's not going to get away with it here say where to go so people have a lot of questions they'd like to ask me and we'd be here for 10 more hours and i wouldn't be sleeping people always invite me then if they ever ask me to visit their home they try so hard to stay up while i'm up and they're like falling asleep sitting next to me wanting to ask i don't do that anymore by the way i've actually spoken in i'm trying to remember the name of that great black university it's either maryland or washington dc i actually got to go speak there oh yeah george washington university yeah i did i was invited and they couldn't squeeze the people they couldn't get them they gave us a small room then bigger room a bigger room because the students asked for it and they have to say yes and they had so many crammed in there you couldn't hardly breathe and the next night there was even more and i was staying in the home of this family nobody could stay up they're like i gotta go to sleep and i'm still sitting here you know in heaven you don't have to sleep people go i always wanted a bedroom done a certain way well you'll get it he'll make it for you to make you happy it'll be your lounge room your meditation room you don't need to meditate when you're living with the one that you meditate about your mansions are amazing some are under the crystal sea somewhere up in the skies of heaven they have a rain forest in heaven these 12 massive trees that could hold some i've seen mansions the size of new york city one one mansion probably belonged to an intercessor seriously somebody you never knew or heard of you know they prayed in every move of god until they were going on they're probably still praying when they were leaving and i like to tell these young people you may be living your life you want to but if you have a grandma in heaven she's going to pray the fire of god down on you to send the angels of heaven to pursue you and talk to the holy spirit non-stop you may as well get up here roll over and lay down and give up right now because they're going to get you you'll listen to the prayers of your grandma i was in a where it was a fireman's sub i'll talk anywhere and somebody made a comment about my hair which god picked not me i did not pick this thing here i was not a pink hair person oh no remember i was the one that wanted to just hide i want to be invisible i was okay with being invisible he said you're not going to be invisible you're not going to be hiding anymore that's what he said to me we need you to have pink highlights in your hair now i had probably about 40 pastor friends in my city and then they thought that was it i went over the edge knowing me not changed but my pink hair made it impossible to to be friends with what is wrong with these people oh they have no clue they're they're in the flesh not the spirit this is a spirit test if you don't like it you're in the flesh you like it you're walking in the spirit so i don't ask for it but you can't hide so everywhere i go and pastors go i can't invite you my congregation would freak out if they saw your pink hair i said you just didn't know how many hours they watched of me on youtube and guess what they come to my meetings at the church next door to you i don't think they're not the ones who aren't ready i think it's you so because of this pink hair it opens up me to speak about heaven everywhere everywhere everywhere all day all day no matter where it is it's even happened here already it doesn't matter people are attracted to it while your hair is amazing yeah the pastor should hear that right get your evangelistic team to get color-colored highlights in their hair and send them out into the streets and see how many people they can draw it's great marketing and so they will say hey your hair is cool yeah this is heaven culture what does that mean that means i know god he asked me to have pink hands in his hair i've been to heaven they all have highlights what and they never say this you're lying this is what a non-believer no matter how on drugs whatever it is they'll go what did it look like you know their souls kind of loosened up because they've been taking something and what's in there will come out what did it look like i've had meetings at the cashier where the lines backing up then they're listening the bad boys are listening the bad boys at the next one cashier comes over so they can hear well i'm saying it's because of this thing here so i understand jesus when he said we need you to have pink highlights in your hair and he can read my thoughts and i'm thinking in my head why and he looked at me and says it's if the lord of glory ever says to you with all the love he has his heart it's necessary i don't care what he wants then he just keeps he keeps going we don't want you to be hidden you can't hide anymore we're going to market heaven with that pink hair we want people to know the truth we want to know it's not boring it's exciting it's powerful it's amazing i want you to know as a believer the authority and dominion that you have in this earth and it's okay if you color highlights in your hair you look like heaven angels are different colors they're not just all pasty white glowing with white wings in a white gown some would probably make you crawl under your seat they have a band around their head with eyes and that whole band they have they have this this whatever thing they call this thing a breastplate thank you yes they have eyes all through them in the front and the back their wings are made out of electricity or lightning their faces are angular their eyes are diamond shaped if one comes in your room it's not from hell and some of them can look really fierce really fears like i have two heads one facing this way one facing that way they both look front and back no matter where they're turning they can see some are weapons they don't need to carry weapons i'm more acquainted with the army of heaven than gabriel's group i've seen gabriel's group i know my guardian angel i've known him since i was little he's 40 feet high i won't tell you his name ask god would you tell me what my angel's name is so i could say thank you you're not worshiping him and they won't let you worship them and an army doesn't get worshipped they want commands they need orders like this army they have generals they have privates they have commanders all kind of levels in the army itself but we get to command because jesus christ did they were made for us to command they don't protect heaven not one angel there's not one angel building is not one was designed to protect heaven from who from who the army didn't even get to throw them all out michael held him while god zapped him with a lightning bolt from himself it says i saw a satan fall as lightning well one third of the angels went right behind him he kicked them all out that was his um intolerance no tolerance for evil or wickedness he doesn't want us to tolerate it either your words your deeds what you choose what you say especially declare yourself into the spirit realm how you go get a staff it helps well i declare the state will not have my neighborhood i come in the host of heaven to get into every single home leave the life of god in there speak to every person while they're sleeping drive out every demon from this place because i'm not living near them and i will not tolerate them and i won't then i went from that to my city then i went to that to my state driving all the witches out please don't dress like a witch on october 31st you're inviting them harvest festival one thing don't participate with satan's holiday my daddy always told me it was wrong i said to my grandmother and one day we realize it is wrong why would he have a holiday he deserves nothing remember that when you get invited to something one day we in one quest will have the biggest festivals of light all over the world on october 31st we will celebrate life the life of god his plans and we'll throw a party everywhere we go and tell people what hell is really like and so is halloween you don't want it you're participating don't look at me weird i've been to hell you don't want to participate it's all real his plans his revelation his son holy spirit christ wiping up hell on the third day they were screaming and running he was melting the faces of the hierarchy of hell enjoying it why did it say he made a show of it he was putting on a show in hell god put a show on in heaven right when he kicked him out christ put a show on in helm when he wiped him all out guess who gets to put the show on on the earth we do we do because of jesus for jesus and with jesus we will put the biggest show on ever that is why he calls us his sons and daughters that's why he says we will manifest his absolute power and authority in the earth it is our right as a born-again believer having invited jesus into our lives when i was four and i asked him in i saw him step in me i was four years old don't discount your little kids i liked it so much when i was five i did it again so i'm book one i said i got born again at four on book five book two hey don't tell me there's five and book two i said i got saved to five and this woman who loved everything i had been saying and receiving it when she found out she said you lied this is a legal minded person you lied you said you were born again at four and you said five you didn't even remember i said excuse me i did it twice maybe you should maybe you should do it again in the assemblies of god we got saved every week we did whether we needed to or not we still got saved oh the baptist did it all the time they're doing everybody's neighborhood in their yard it doesn't matter the baptists are great soul winners y'all they really are they're very bold but don't let the watchtower people come in your home don't want to give you their watchtower magazine burn it or shred it it's false religion all false religions are run by one person that satan is called an antichrist spirit remember jesus talked about it that means anything is against christ's sovereignty and his his holiness of who he is his his anything who's against that that speaks against that isn't antichrist spirit let's all stand up for a minute come back tomorrow i hope you come back tomorrow you hear about america a lot what'd you say wear red white and blue please i'll be wearing red white and blue i will and heaven will be wearing it too whoever watches whoever comes will i was recently in um not carpenter's home church what was the name of the church in orlando calvary assembly of god i was there invited with a lot of other prophets who were taken out of their box because jeff jensen was in charge and he never has a program or a schedule you flow with him so all these great leaders are all sitting up on the platform and and jeff would just say all right get up there and start speaking and they're like they'd look at me because i'm a friend right he made me sit beside him or behind him in case i was the only one

do you believe [Music] [Music] superhero [Music] and he will win [Applause] this is a part of time appointed by me from heaven this night i light a flame on the top of this mountain it will never be put out for you have stood through adversity through the lies to the accusations through the control the demands of man you have worshipped me you have not forgotten my son you have not forgotten what he's done you will be blessed and you will never stop being blessed for i am the god of everybody and the god of everything i'm about to shake this earth great exposure of the darkness [Music] [Applause] no matter what people or the fake news or the lying liberals have said about me or this time they don't know anything [Music] if they do not stop they will lose everything their words will become dust and blown away like they were never there for i say this is a time of greatness of acceleration you've never known and the manifested sons and daughters to come forth to demonstrate to manifest my power my love my plans [Music] the devil has plans he will fail and he will lose again and again and again and again and again and again [Music] for i have already said i will be in the white house for 24 years [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is no one on this earth in this earth under this earth that can stop it from happening for i will have these days on the earth the great days the great days of knowing there is a god that he speaks that he sears sees and hears if my prophets do not prophesy what i say they will not have a voice until that season is over for these are not the days of doom and gloom these are not the days of the rapture the perilous times the tribulation they're times of greatness of the fire and the glory sweeping over this earth touching everyone crushing the darkness and pushing it back for i am cleaning the stage wiping it clean are the enemies camp are the enemies people are the enemies dust [Music] for i will have my way my son made a way i will not ignore what he has done and i will not have a weak pathetic testimony of his sacrifice no one says when he is coming back but me and i am not ready for i will set you on fire and you will demonstrate like no one has before in all of history the powerful things of god to speak to the land the sea in the air and it will move do not tolerate evil and do not participate with it you choose life or death because they are apparently out there right now always choose life for when you side with those who want death of the unburn you will never win you will never succeed or complete your destiny you will repent because i bring life and life abundantly but you must choose it and if you choose it you must live it get out of the gray area stop riding on the fence for i hear those who've humbled themselves whose heart cries out for more but this time you get to bring them more [Music] i said it would be my sons and daughters who did it there is no age for them whether it's three or 153 you choose for if you sit on the side and do nothing that's what you will have a boring life an unfruitful life be bold and step out let people know what you believe and who you believe they'll come beating your door down to find out about your god not the false gods who have no life not the lies of the enemy he thinks he can take my country for it is mine i created it i called it into being i had people fight for it and die for it in the seasons past you've died to live for me but it now you will live and not die if you choose was it what is it to you if i keep you until my son returns be strong be excited and celebrate the victory even before it happens do not listen to the doom and gloom that does not come from me but fearful hearts that don't know what time it is they don't know what my plans are and they want to escape run your race but run it with me for i'll be right beside you and i will open the eyes of many and they will see me and they will know their god those who have stood and been faithful even under attack even though things were taken from you do you not think i can give you a hundred times more than what you had it is my desire to bless you it is my desire to be with you for there are times there are only in the power of my hand and these are some of those times listen to what is true where there is no confusion and nothing hidden don't believe the lies of those who live in sin and say they live and speak for me someone will remove from the earth [Music] i won't allow their testimony of who i am to be here many who are lying cheating and stealing and even killing will lose not just their seat but their life this is a holy time but it is a time to celebrate heaven celebrates with this time live on earth like they live in heaven but you have to be willing and obedient the host will not listen to those to be commanded by those who do not speak the words of my son nor have him in their heart not just as their savior but as their king many kings will come forth in this time for my son is the king of spiritual kings and the lord of spiritual lords in the spirit there is no difference between male nor female both can rise to that position of authority and dominion but you have to pursue it and if you want my thoughts you better walk in my ways and you better say his will his way not his will man's way i'm about to consume this country and people will come here to find me not just the american dream some regions the light and the glory will be so great in people will drive their dead relatives in there they'll come to life [Music] neither sin nor crime nor sickness will be able to abide in those regions you are forerunners it is an honor and a privilege to be chosen if you're alive and you're breathing and you've given yourself to my son you are chosen know this night that your god has visited you and spoken his words to you if they don't light up with others then do not receive those words for i stand on my word and beside my son on my throne these are days we have talked about before you were ever born before the earth was made we spoke of these days why would i give them up if you buy a bible and it says it's my word and it's left parts out don't read it if it makes it easy to live to freely sin there's the gods beside me that can bring you to my home those are lies from hell for my word and my truth will make you free says your god amen and amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] can you hear me now [Music] i know there are people who will tell you that you cannot see the faces of god and live but even the one who spoke those words and they were written in the word saw the face of god john himself in the book of john said you cannot see the face of god and live but in the book of revelation in chapter 4 he was caught up he was in the spirit that's a place you walk in he was in a place on that day where he could hear no word of man on the isle of patmos at least that day unless he decided to walk off of it i chose to let him see things are different because he was in that place i could catch him up and stand before my throne with the living rainbow moving in and out of me with life moving in and out of me and he saw my face and never again after that did he say you cannot see the face of god and live for i have caught many up and showed many my face my plans but this one's standing before you she is my revelator i will never stop taking her to heaven what business is it to you if i want to i hold the air you breathe if i choose somebody who's been willing and obedient and laid down in their life every time i asked why would i not trust her yes she's a woman and she's a king in the spirit [Applause] she's not just my servant she is my daughter and it is my great pleasure to reveal her as my treasure to operate without measure in these days [Music] if you're willing to pay the price you think it's so easy to have to live a halfway normal life on this earth when you're so connected to me in heaven she does not see things like you see them but she will reveal everything i show her and will not be afraid of the face of man even hell trembles when she speaks [Applause] everyone should be dangerous against hell it is evil and wickedness that tries to consume your country but i will not tolerate it for my people have humbled themselves they have repented of their wicked ways and i will heal their land [Music] for i hear everyone and i see everyone nothing is hidden from me when i look at the earth i rejoice i remember when my son and i made it we made it to kerry the glory the power the a wonder station before you come home i know your trials i know your test if you fall down get up [Applause] tell the enemy you will no longer tolerate him in your life that means you will not tolerate his images his words his frequencies his songs you create a habitation for heaven in your home and it will come you will see angels coming and going for you are in a new season the season of the high call of god of your god why did you not expect for things to be exposed before every great thing was done hell always acted up but this time the exposure is for your benefit these are not new things they've always been here you just never knew it i'm pulling away every closed door basement building things hidden in the wilderness things hidden in the forest even things hidden underground i will expose it all [Applause] the lives of those those who want to stand and run your country but hate me hate life even hate the people they want to govern it will not happen for i will shake them and nothing will be hidden but openly shown and dealt with even those have already been in power and think they've gotten away with it [Applause] [Music] they will not trump may not be perfect but he gives me permission to be in this country from the highest office in the land he has welcomed me and prayed to me and made friends with my pastors my prophets my teachers my evangelists his closest friends are my sons and daughters but the world would reject them and hate them there are many people in this world praying for your president even they love him even they recognize the good in him the authority in him he will help to shift many leaders of many governments so i can shape that nation and he will sweep his platform clean one day to make room for pence i have heard words spoken against my vice president and i am not happy he is a godly man who is not afraid of anything he is a strong tower to temper your president he will win two terms also [Music] [Applause] for i have written that in my book and what my book says it will happen not maybe happen [Music] [Applause] whoever he picks to be his vice president will then be president for eight years after him by that time there'll be no opposition that will even have a voice to speak [Music] [Applause] america will be a great light to this world it is my gift to this world who allows my son my greatest gift to operate in this world get ready because the show is beginning [Music] there's coming a day when people will step into a store thinking they're going to buy something and they will step into my glory and begin to cry out to know me satan knows about these days but he was hoping he could stop them this is a place of freedom liberty and justice for all it is also a place for righteousness and holiness that your amazing forefathers heard my voice and made plans for it the enemy has always been afraid of america don't be afraid even if you come home you'll be with me there is no fear not even in death you just step from life to life if your family live here they're the most blessed people in existence plans to be great because it is time for i will pour out my spirit on all flesh children will begin to pastor at age [Applause] five children are the easiest to reach because they don't question and they don't reason and they don't let their mind get involved that's why i said you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom you have not because you asked not but those who've asked already will surely get what they have asked for it is a new time on the earth a miracle will be an example but many countries will run to the light and to my son for there is a habitation coming that will not end until i say it will [Applause] end rejoice that i have shown these things and spoken to you of these things for those are my plans the more you believe it is real the more real it will become there's coming a day very soon that when you come here the glory will be waiting [Music] portals are being opened everywhere for heaven to pour in but also for blessings to pour in those who say i cannot speak through the voice of a man or mankind don't know me make sure you laugh laughter is the language of heaven but profanity is the language of hell don't let those words be in your mouth in your home allowed to enter into your home guard your soul and the souls of your children by not letting anything pass through any form of media it will be a trap of the enemy of what you've given permission to come will come if you say good morning to me every morning you'll be saying it before my throne you command the day by what you choose when you first wake choose life and love my power my presence extreme discernment and get understanding these days will come quickly and your life will change day by day so all who hear this message if you are my son or my daughter if you have received my son and repented of your sins these words are for you do not walk around with your head held down but lift it up where your help comes from even if people laugh they will not be laughing for long pray for those who have chosen the darkness and are expecting it to win some will take their life when they lose because their souls have been compromised by the lies they've been listening to guard well the layers of your soul what you put there and always choose life i love you says your god amen yes [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh it is hard to stand i won't fall i'm sure my angels are behind me i don't want a stool what is that no no but we could just lay hands on everybody and end it [Music] it's pretty pretty hard to top god and for those of you who don't think this is real may he come to you when i walked in the angel of the lord who looks just like jesus came in behind me to make sure i wouldn't fall down before i got up here and god's been speaking to me like the last several hours before i got here and some people think why is she late why is she late well are you going to turn around and say no to god i was right on time [Applause] god was very wise calling me a revelator instead of a prophet because he knew all the bashers wouldn't know what a false revelator was he was very detailed with me before i started traveling and speaking and he'd already warned me about a lot of stuff that would happen or would be said which i understand people don't understand what they don't know or they have not experienced their self it is hard for them to receive it seeing is not believing receiving is believing god has given me many titles i didn't ask for any of them and many people say i want to be you i go no you don't you don't really and i've heard people say he chose seven men before he chose you no he didn't he did choose me he knew me when i was in him he knew every one of you already knew what you would become and on your soul that he created he wrote if he would be male or female no matter how man says how that happens and your soul will be conflicted if you're told you're something else because your soul already knew what it was supposed to be but if the ones who wanted to take over have their way they would let anybody choose whatever they want to but god has a plan you were with him before you came to this earth before this world was made before he stretched out the universe the physical realm over the spiritual realm that's why when it says in revelations he will roll it up he knows where the ends are he had to put something out there that he could put physical things on because all he had the original realm is the spiritual realm the unseen realm unless he lets you see it from the time i was little i was a seer i saw the good guys and the bad guys i saw activities of the spirit realm you hear people talk about angels and demons there's much more than that all around you there's buildings built that both sides use depending on what is going around in that area there's platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places how do they get in high places they earn it by hunting for souls for the enemy these are wicked spiritual beings however when you learn to command an army that was created to pull down every stronghold of satan they're the ones who war against hell no matter what level of wickedness they operate in they can shred those platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places and they go through light buzz saws and they can't stop it from happening because we who have the flesh you're the ones who have authority in the earth every spirit would be coming from hell trying to take over they use people like they apparently are right now but they cannot do it they can't the earth is made for men and those who receive jesus christ you're called to rule in the spirit realm when you take authority and dominion in the spirit realm it then impacts and packs this physical realm and because we haven't known how to do it to his fullness satan has just taken all he wants to done what he wanted to kill who he wants to put fear in who he wants to we're not tolerating it anymore jesus clearly said the things i did you will do and greater things you will do than i did so you should be trying to stop the storms we can help you do that you can either email or call our office and ask for weather warrior information that's god's name that he gave for this group who's willing to step out and just do what his son did i didn't pick that name we are to take authority over any form of destructive weather and whether you know it or not in the word of god when he made the ocean and he made the land he told the ocean i set a boundary right here at the land and you will not pass over that's god's word that's his decree we are his sons and daughters it is our job to uphold that and tell those storms you will not cross over on the land or do destruction he created the weather to nourish the earth not to damage it so we sit down here and say god come and rescue us come and stop this and he's looking down saying i gave you authority you have authority you rule because the enemy knows he can get in and twist any of those weather system and use them the best he can because he comes to what kill steal destroy and one of the ways he does that is with the weather so volcanoes are not supposed to be erupting tsunamis are not supposed to be destroying none of that stuff that's going on but there's been no voice or agreement in the body that they would no longer tolerate that he taught the disciples how to multiply food how to travel in the spirit realm how to take authority and dominion over all the power of the darkness cast out any and all demons to pray for the sick to be healed why are we tolerating the virus because i'm not it has no right here the body needs to wake up stand up and step out you can wake up all you want to he wants you to do all of those things and i can tell you right now the meteorologists don't know what's happening they're going wild we even have some of their briefings where they talked about what is wrong with this weather they're almost afraid to give a forecast of anything because it never happens and then they faked it they faked it to prove these things were happening those weren't even the storm that was going on those in the area that the storms are headed to have the greatest authority if you're a believer so those on the east coast we have melt we have built a wall and if you go back and look at every storm that's come after dorian when we told it we all started saying you will not and cannot cross over the boundaries god set for you and all the way down not just in florida where we started it all the way up the east coast believers are standing saying you will not cross over and do destruction and every time a storm comes you can go look at it it comes a certain way then it hits the wall and goes back out and they don't understand it's simply the body of christ taking authority so when we learn oh hawaii has got it down we have a lot of friends there's a lot of weather warriors that live in hawaii it doesn't even get started before they get out there and they start i'll never forget the time that this massive like i think was category 5 was coming and i had been teaching and talking to him about taking authority and we all declared that this storm will not be allowed to come ashore and the head of it would be taken off and when everyone went to bed except me because they don't sleep at night when they all went to bed when they woke up there was nothing but shreds left and they couldn't understand or get it because they knew for sure that the the island would be consumed and those people those whether foreign would not let up that prayer of agreement we had they said we don't know how it happened but it looks like the head was taken these are the meteorologists saying this the head was taken right off [Music] it was a nothing and one reporter said never in 25 years of being a meteorologist i ever see i never saw that happen i'm still trying to go back over all the tapes all the information that we've accumulated to know exactly what could should have happened and it didn't happen why because they're not tolerating it so whoever lives in the gulf better stop stepping up is not coming to florida i live there and i'm not putting up with it anymore [Applause] you need to just get fed up what yes whoever has the fires in your state you better start saying you're not tolerating it anymore you come into low pressure system to form and come in and put the fires out [Applause] that is not something new in the bible they called forth rain to come and they begin to see the clouds form did it come and did it rain why are we any different than them it's called believing your faith and guess what in heaven you'll need your faith not to pay your rent not to be healed not for any of those things but to begin to create who is our father do you know in the bible when it says let us make men in our image that's what they look like like with the glory on them the light of god on them but after our likeness is how they operate we're supposed to operate like them we are not god you don't want to be god i don't want to be god i've seen alone but i still don't want to be god no one's that many kids the devil actually isn't god's problem it's how we all operate and stand against them he should be running does it say he will run from us do you remember that scripture you submit yourself under the hand of god and resist the enemy what will he do he will flee from you he's talking to you you do you know the word resist doesn't go oh no no i don't know what this is i will not tolerate you you're a liar and a friar and i serve the most high god only him and he'll run there are people the demons beg not to be assigned to because when they come back and they're not successful with their assignment they get punished the devil doesn't give anybody rewards not even his own he just punishes them when they don't listen so they don't want to they'll lie they'll do anything they can they don't want to and by the way when you learn to release the anointing they burn and it hurts they'll burn if they get near the fire of god it will burn them like it's going to melt them they may live in hell's fire they don't want god's fire why baptism and fire is coming [Music] [Applause] see i was raised on the word of god god chose when my birth would happen on this earth he chose my father's my mother's by the way my mother is here tonight she'll be 90 next april she had 15 children i am number three and my sister's number 15 right there and any of them could testify to anything i'm saying i never was normal i didn't want to speak to people even though i didn't want to speak to people i didn't want to hug them i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you know my little nice apartment somewhere and do big business he took me out of my world of business yeah it's like he didn't know we need to pay checks seriously he did this he always told me before he would do something with me my grandmother was my dad's mother was a powerful woman of god she was in the jungles of panama and was afraid of nothing ever she'd come to her home on sabbatical i mean we had more kids than anybody she could have come any anywhere i don't remember she had eight or nine of her own our aunts and uncles so she had a lot of children but she always came to our house because god was there we knew she could see through the walls we knew she could see right inside of us and every time she came she'd lay her hand on her head you will serve and know the most high god and my brother would run and hide i'm not going to be a missionary and be eaten by the alligators or crocodiles no right now they lock him on death row to minister to death apprentice prisoners he's invited by hell's angels to come and do funerals i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles anymore my mom would tell me every day you are so strange i don't know what god's going to do with you i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day my whole life i would know things my siblings didn't care too much for that my dad was a great mentor that his own mother in the jungles of panama on her own they had a murderer loose in the village i know some of you heard the story before but it just shows you who she was she was on the mission field in the little hut somewhere where she was ministering and she i think she lived there for i forgot how many years many years and everybody was boarding up their windows to keep this murder from out she left her window open and she went to sleep right in front of the window because guess what she knew god sure enough late at night here comes a foot in the window and this huge machete coming with him and she turn around look at him and she goes freeze in jesus name and rolled over and went back to sleep and three hours later when the police arrived he was still frozen that was my grandmother i was taught to never be afraid i knew there was a god i knew there was his son i knew there was holy spirit who is my best friend that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a day that's what that means let me speak to you 24 hours a day but lots of times he's tweaking you he wouldn't warn me something's going to happen i don't think i'd do that that's what he says to me i don't think i'd go there so i'm not going to go there okay i don't ask him why but you have to have your ears open to listen and it's really good idea if you say i choose holy spirit to give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention it is one of the most powerful things you can say anybody here let's just say it together holy spirit from this moment on i give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention so be it there you did it i did that when i was really young it saved me a lot let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen she'd come up here now she would preach all the time she knows that's true because he does the same thing with her every morning it's called living a new life heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a lifestyle so if you want to live on earth as they live in heaven you need to learn to live heaven culture what is that how they live in heaven and living the same way on the earth they're free of fear free of lack free of grief free of anything of the enemy never sick they go well they're in heaven yes they are but our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come by the way that is heaven your kingdom is heaven you're speaking to the father right your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven that is heaven culture you are literally praying a prayer that asks for heaven culture and he's released it on the earth you choose it you lose everything under your soul that's not him every trauma from the past every wicked evil disgusting vile movie you've ever watched with your eyes it's in your soul it's why he says to guard it for out of it will flow the way you live your life as a man think it's in his heart which is your soul not talking about your human beating heart the heart also means the core or the center of something that's your soul that's what you are you are a living soul and what you fill it with is what you will become that's why people you've known all your life kind nice people i know some of them who now hate with a hate i've never seen before in people they hate and despise don't even know why why they listen to the fake news and for years they have filled their layers you have layers whatever you feel the most of is what you're going to begin to act like so if you don't like you change what you're watching even what you say goes in your own soul so if you don't like you you've been telling yourself that for years and you put another layer of it in you and what's in there is what you will think about and if you think about it you're going to choose it if you choose it you're going to do it again that's called what criminals do this is true that's why a criminal will get out of prison go commit a crime and go back right back to prison if they've been there 20 years it'll you know why it's in their soul and i've been to prison to talk it's good to hear that and i had 80 prisoners and they had somebody guards trying to watch they never watched they listened to protect me my husband was with me sitting up here staring at every one of them but then even he was crying and i told them how they were sought out by the enemy even as a little child they had a great call on their life so he didn't want them to be loosed on the earth they might find out who they are and do destruction to his plans so he gets them into crime this is truth he gets him into crime when you do it it was in your soul then he makes sure they get caught and then they get put in prison where they can't be a threat to him so every time they get up because it's in them guess what they do it doesn't matter how much therapy they give them how many classes they take them to if they can't get it out of them they'll think about it they'll do it and then they're back in the same place so i told them the story of their life this is what you're doing this is why you're doing it this is what god had for you this is what satan is doing to you and will proceed to do it to every member of your family if you can then they begin to cry then they get furious you get mad at the devil then they get born again filled with the holy spirit then it teaches them how to war i teach them how to send heaven's army so now insider prisons are very dangerous people who are dangerous against hell i mean anybody could go to prison right but why are these people in rhythm they are dangerous because of their destiny and satan doesn't want them loose your soul is very important to you don't ever forget that you choose with your soul all day long you choose christ right after that you should choose what he chooses all day long you should guide what you choose what you watch what you say i love that little saying these half years what would jesus do what would he say what would he choose it's actually a very free life to not sin people get shocked when they say i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's not you choose not to you just say no say no to who was ever asking you sorry my soul is too important i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really think you were weird who cares because when they start to die they'll call you to pray for them they'll look for you if it's on their deathbed hey you know about heaven i need to go there they'll forget they made fun of you that's why it's important that you not suffer trauma for 30 years after it happened you know who's doing that the devil because you saw it or experienced it and he will replay it and replay it stop the video stop it stop it stop it and lose it from your soul jesus and after your will because of jesus to lose it from your soul he'll come down and pull it out and it will literally be like it never happened to you [Music] i've seen too many people set free and they went from being you know in the dredges of despair suicidal they'd have these dreams every night about the torment or whatever it was the trauma they went through and three minutes with me and the revelation god gave me while their husband their pastor went in the store to get me some things to eat i was invited to speak his wife was set free she was a different person when he came out and then she brought her 17 year old and her 11 year old sons to me because they were present when she was abused so much they lose out of all their soul and they haven't never six years later i've never had another nightmare or torment you can be free the truth makes you free and the truth is you can be free even from heroin from witchcraft homosexuality doesn't matter what it is from the enemy you choose with your will to be free and yes we pray for people to be free from homosexuality which is a spirit and guess what they have powerful destinies every one of them the devil targets the ones who have the greatest destinies to bring freedom or liberty to people and he wants to keep them from doing that so he gets them distracted sidetracked on the wrong path filled with lies believing that's how god made them but remember when he made them he wrote on their soul this is who you are this is what you will be and he had plans for them from that moment i will tell you this there is a move coming to them and millions of them will get born again [Music] not not not just a few millions he'll move on them they'll know who they were he'll know the entire time it was a lie and they will repent from it reject it completely and run into god's kingdom and they'll be great witnesses i will also tell you this millions of muslims are about to expect they will experience salvation god is still into saving people number one thing make sure you belong to him if you get saved at least you're going to have it a lot of people have it happen on their deathbed and the family member said i never saw it happen so you think it didn't happen did you believe they would be because the number one thing besides getting jesus you better believing that your family members will know jesus christ give their life to him and be with you in heaven there's a reason why you should do that you have the greatest influence in the spirit realm over their life as family members and jesus the first time he took me to heaven said there'd be so many in the earth to be shocked when they get there to see who's up there and yet they were the very one who prayed and believed for their salvation we have so many promises as a believer we as the body of crisis will see an example a living walking breathing taking authority dominion releasing life to people and let them see you happy and joyful while you're doing it maybe they might want jesus one of the biggest things i know it will happen eventually the world will know us the body of christ by our what our love for each other stop fighting the plan of the enemy dividing conqueror is his plan and in this whole last year several years before the virus it's not a plague and it is not a disease even in the natural viruses come and they go but people act like they are i'm not saying you can't protect yourself if you want to i'm not tolerating sickness or disease i'm not tolerating it every time you bless your food i hope you're blessing your food i won't ask for a show of hands my daddy let us eat after we blessed our food and then he added things the prayer went on forever i know where he got it from because when his mom came off the mission field she would have a 40 minute prayer at the dinner and she knew without open her eyes if you were going to leave the table and then she'd pray for you blessing your food is a very powerful thing because it says when you do that and you ask he will take sickness far from you so if you haven't been doing it do it that means he won't allow it to come to you or your home that's what you've got an interpretation you won't allow it to come to you or your home if you are declaring that when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes long but you know i added a few things i will hold my plate up in the restaurant or anywhere else look at father doesn't it smell good and i'm gonna enjoy every bite of it so bless it to my body and may the isis have a never-ending crisis may hell have triple trouble in hell as long as i'm alive i thank you for blessing all those who serve you who know you who love you amen so if we go out together after i'm invited and that pastor says will you bless the food who's ever with me will go okay and what are they gonna do here i'm picking up my plate are they going to sit there and just stare at theirs lift it up everybody [Applause] i'm training you to blush your food that you actually can have food and actually can eat the food amen many countries can't do that but we can remember that the next time somebody asks you to say blessing i challenge you to do it do you know why because it was a day when i was in my late teens and i was saying my rope prayer father thank you for the soon blessings in my body and my swelling was named my person thank you wayman did you even hear those words and i literally heard from heaven this is before he started taking me i heard like a rubber stamp wham 500 billion 260 million eight hundred and ten and 0001 can you say something else that we might actually be excited to hear he really said that to me so from that day i have never blessed my food like that it's a habit that's not a blessing that's not a blessing it's a habit right you need to get god excited father i thank you for this amazing food smells good looks good i can't wait to see what you're going to do with me next i am so ready who cares what people hear at least they'll know there's someone around that knows god my little sister gave her famous blessing i think she was four or five and we were all huh not jen one of our other sisters i have eight sisters and seven brothers and an alligator named charlie but he's in heaven he doesn't have to live in a bathtub up but i've seen him in heaven your pets i'll go to heaven be nice to them they'll remember you and they'll talk [Applause] [Music] and i already hear some people's heads it's too late to tell me that's not true you haven't been there because if you did you would know that why not did you know that many animals actually have a spirit in the soul go back to genesis and read when noah back in the day when my meetings would be six hours long i'd do three or four i was just like like this and i would call let's see i called them i have called noah moses and adam and then one time i called him noses because my head was so tired i couldn't remember and every time i knew that everybody emailed me i don't think you know who actually put people on the ark and then we get phone calls and they go yeah she knows she blew it okay she knows this is moa and noses and noah because you know she couldn't really remember if you go back and read that you know what i'm telling this is what the father told me this is how he taught me like a little kid because when i go to heaven i'm like eight years old with pigtails and he actually talks to all of you like children man is the one who likes to expound and make things totally not even understandable or approachable but god doesn't talk to us like that so he talked me said i'm going to teach you something and why because i've seen pets in heaven and i'm like wow there's every one of my pets they were in this long line and they were on my father's ranch in heaven and they started with sally the pig and i got i got corrected because i said there was pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the pig he was a family pet gave them to my father when he retired from the ministry it was this big when it died it was 1100 pounds i saw her in heaven and her were two little mice that we had in new york city when you were allowed to have pets they lived in the wall they were residents so we just kept them i recognized my brother joey's duck name max that he had when he was nine charlie the alligator that i've always talked about we all had in florida we live in florida and he lived in our bathtub and we had to take it out and clean the tub and he'd wander around the bathroom every goat bird fish snake lots of them spiders and iguana named iggy i saw every single one of them in heaven every one of them a long line as long as you see following my dad walking around on my dad's ranch and the father took me to the stone he said i need to explain this to you because people will argue and they're not god so they think they know better than me but if you go read the scripture in genesis where i told noah to put the animals on the ark and then he took me further you know even closer further away at the beginning of time when he made adam and it talks about how you know god the father and jesus were both there by the way the father said adam jesus stepped out of him that's what the word always did he stepped out and made his body but there was no life in him until he did one thing the father leans over because the father carries life he leaned over and breathed adam's spirit of life that was his spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual body into his nostrils and he became a living soul and i went oh yeah i've always known that he said but you didn't never connect it to noah go back and read this scripture in genesis and i did and do you know what it says that god told noah to put every animal on the earth that had a spirit of life in it you don't have to believe me believe the word that meant those creatures had souls and a spirit body oh that's from god i can't take credit that's how revelation happens it changes the way you think so people will argue with you it's too late it's in the word so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul i think they just they go die and go to hell with the flies [Applause] they came from hell they can't have a soul right but i did learn that all your pets go to heaven and then when one would die i'd actually see my angel take his spiritual body and take it to heaven your own guardian angel takes your pet's spiritual body and takes it to heaven and they live in your mansion they will be eating at the table when you get there they will not be eating off the floor anymore so people go it doesn't say the word animals are in heaven it says creatures preach the gospel to who what to what i preached the gospel to every pe i had i was gonna make sure they made it creatures remember around the throne the living they have bodies like animals but they're not they're highly intelligent have always been with god like melchizedek who had no father no mother no beginning or ends there was more than father son and holy spirit i always say father word and holy spirit and so melchizedek has always been with him he is father's personal high priest thank you not one of adam's sons he's not a human that died and went to heaven he's always been with him i've seen a syllabus this big that tells you about um what is it what is that one thing they talk about well number one they always talk about the stone god will give you when you get to heaven and you always see on the syllabus a river rock with some big long name because he will give you a nickname the only he and you know and that white rock is a white diamond is not a river rock the word rock in heaven means gemstone because he's not cheap or poor right when when you get married you give your the toes a ring with a diamond in it or some beautiful stone right he's old bran so get ready for your pets to be in heaven amen and they'll be with you for all eternity so i keep telling people be nice to them they'll thank you for how often you let them out or fed them the food under the table you weren't supposed to why do you think they try to eat it off of the table later when you're not there you spoil them so when he said heaven is beyond anything you ever thought or imagined it is unless i like the word unless it be revealed by his spirit so the spirit of god is the one who catches me up all the time without warning me i fall in the driveway i'll go to heaven i'm in the grocery store reaching for something he takes me to heaven my family know because they'll come in to talk to me and there's nothing in me this my spirit man's in heaven the holy spirit climbs and keeps my body alive my husband is so used to it of 43 years he'll come in and say something to me i don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't look down and watch what people are doing are you kidding i'm listening to what god is showing me but my husband will say these words oh i'll come back later he is he is scottish he's not moved by anything even as his wife's body is sitting there not breathing he is not concerned see he picked the right person for me i remember the first day he saw an angel walking down our hallway and he freaked out although i've talked about them thousands of times he actually saw one he's like nothing would come out i said oh did you see the angel he never doubted he just never you don't sit there and cry because he doesn't get to go he's happy i go and he's happy i speak don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll get a joke and it will be a scottish silk that you'll never get the ending to you'll never get the punchline but if you ever want to fish and catch big fish that is a gift god gave him when he sent him from himself he made him a fisherman that's his passion that's his greatest thing besides me and jesus and guess what i hate yes i hate fish let willy be free i don't want him in my freezer in my home in a frying pan or on my table they're slimy they stink they smell and i don't like i don't like them so if i went fishing he'd have to take it off he'd still be here in jesus game and i'm not touching that fish and do you think god knew this of course he knew it of course he gave some of me somebody with five layers in their soul that's like a rock and you aren't ever changing that man i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can say loves jesus hears very clearly gives me words from god all the time little scratches of paper but doesn't talk about it so he gave me somebody who doesn't care about talking or want to talk thank god right because we'd be wearing each other out i pray for people spouses want to see they both minister and they're wanting the microphone [Applause] i have no competition yeah well my sister kind of makes up for her the baby who said she'd never talk to anybody but but taught 15. how many kids you haven't used to class 16 two-year-olds for about 15 years now she's braver than me i don't want to do that i don't want to catch fish and i don't want that either but she's really good at so that's why she's writing all the children's books and they're amazing our artist is every time he gets time he works on it every child around the world will know there is a heaven there is a god and what life is like there and the last place i was taken that was new was called whimsical way it's up in the celestial realm the sky of heaven and any little child who wants to in heaven either climbs into a bubble gets on the bubble train and takes him up to this amazing place parents don't have to go and they have all these creatures little creatures that are their friends and one day they'll be part of our amusement park we've made so heaven has got lots of plans for kids fun you're probably one of the first congregations i told this to it was amazing these little creatures had names they were wearing clothes they were friends to these other kids and they would all go up there whenever they want to and play and play and play and have fun create little things and then they come back down because you live with your parents or your grandparents or whoever is the closest in relation to you when you get to heaven no child is left alone we should celebrate who we are that is your destiny and the new earth i get a lot of flack from that get over it you're not god he's going to make a and say new say new means new he's already remodeled this one several times already he has yeah and when you get to heaven everybody gets to see when he made it you all learn how he made the earth the first time how it got messed up in verse two think about it verse one verse two how did that happen so quick in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that means it was done say don imperfect then wine number two is it a mess why is the water on the land and the sky why is it trapped underneath all that stuff why is the earth all split up why is it in darkness the first one he didn't need the son or the moon yet he made him yet no he lit it with his glory we should study the book of jeremiah he turned the light out at one time satan was making the earth a wilderness rick knocking nose but really when he made it the first time it was perfect and he lit it with his glory there was no evil on the earth at that time and then of course you all know satan lucifer was cast out of heaven down to the earth and he thought he was going to take over he's tried so many times i don't know why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs became evil because they got possessed and used and i know people talk about i don't know where they get these things from reptilian seed because god made the donors dinosaurs not satan oh you don't even want to know about their children you don't need to know about okay it doesn't have anything to do with us man comes up with their own head knowledge and understanding of something and there are no nephilim on the earth right now i assure you there aren't any so there's too much really to talk about all that you've already got what you really needed when the first 15-20 minutes you have revelation that a lot of people don't know what's going to happen you heard like uh i know 24-year plan but really actually heard about a 50-year plan i've been taking over 100 years into the future and the earth was still here and it was good it was really good so each generation until god's ready to stop things it'll get stronger they will manifest more they'll be in charge more and children will probably be the first ones who command a mountain to jump into the sea and if they want to put it back they will because we go from where this is not glory to glory glory to glory glory to glory this is us now glory to the pit glory to the pit glory to depression glory to lack glory to lack that isn't the way it goes it goes from glory to glory to glory that is an upward motion in authority in dominion in joy and celebration and the earth being well a hundred years from now it will be like that so forget stop trying to make plans to escape i don't want to escape i want to be here i'll be here the whole time and the people well jesus comes tribulation comes all over no it's not you don't know the bible because jesus gets he will get his thousand-year reign and god's not keeping that from him why would he he's going to sit on that throne in jerusalem and be king of the world [Music] for a thousand years and it's still not over because satan will be in a big pit oh yeah there will be no weapons on the earth during that thousand years people will live to be seven and 800 years old because christ is sitting on the throne and there'll still be people who aren't saved so that means people will make it through the tribulation the whole earth will not be destroyed in the tribulation and everybody won't be killed off the earth as there'd be no natural people for jesus to rule over when he system that's owned in jerusalem at the end of the tribulation right yeah who's he going to rule who's he going to be in charge of and there'll be kings and countries that don't want him there can you believe that they must have the must be unintelligent i'll be polite it's not what my flesh wanted to say they will be as unintelligent as the devil they will not want him and they'll know he's the son of god he just wiped up all the all the wicked evil armies right he won like trump won not that he's god but look at him he won and he thought this is going to be easy breezy and never has every devil around come after somebody so harshly they hate him because he stands for justice liberty and freedom but they really hated him when he became really dangerous and said i'm fighting god back in your country that was it that was it the devil went crazy he's not going to stay in that seat i'll impeach him i'll declare him incompetent other people rise up all over you know what they want a civil war here for a long time they want all of us to run the streets and kill each other and i've told them i talked to them sometimes do you not understand a true american they actually want life they want a future they have a family they don't want your garbage go to a third-world country and live if you want socialism go where they have dominism we're not going to have it here why the people don't want it [Music] you don't want it and they'll make it sound like it's amazing they'll make it sound like it's beautiful go to venezuela they're living in dumpsters if they can find one that's what happens i grew up because of my natural age i've been through many generations of time on the earth i remember the turmoil of the 60s when people wanted to have nothing but love and or war then they didn't want to go to war they didn't want to do nothing i remember that but i also remember doing we would do these what do you call them when you have to do little see my earth mine doesn't work so well not projects this one you would hide under your desk in case the russians were coming to get you anybody here have to do that you were practicing if you were going to be bombed by the russians what's called the cold war it's pretty cold on that floor under my desk and when i was like eight nine ten they all did it they'd stop and they would let the alarm go everybody would just by habit oh drop what you're doing crawl under your desk and hide in case the bomb would hit we lift like that until it was ended okay so you don't want to live in russia i've been there the sadness is so horrific i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go unsure i could feel it and see it like black clouds of evil and that i could feel with the people with the great deep sadness and grief that they had no freedom because if they take your weapons the criminals aren't going to give up theirs you wonder where their heads are right and who in the world wants to do well i know this is political well you have to give it up because tomorrow that's what you're really going to get god is very politically minded he doesn't want that he only wants that who in the right mind which shows you they probably don't have one anymore wants to defund the police i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in california or washington or oregon or new york chicago i could just go down this list who in their mind having had no freedom for five months would vote in the same governor or the senators or the people who didn't care if their places were being destroyed where does that come from i promise you i won't tell you some of the things the president is going to do as soon as he gets he'll reelected tweaking some governors i'll just say that much and some mayors and getting laws changed [Music] because people even the ones who voted him and don't want them now because they who won't allow are having all the freedom they want to do what they want to and they're openly showing what's in their soul that's the point of all this god is exposing the souls the people and they can hide and smile behind their big office but when it comes push to shove what's in that soul is coming out and people couldn't believe it when it started happening what is wrong with those people are they insane because their people don't have liberty freedom and there is no justice there is no protection there's no food there's no jobs people's houses get broken into when they want to do you know how many people i want to tell you how many people have moved to florida we are being crushed with people every day because they were seeing us on the news having liberty freedom and justice enjoying our beaches we were as good as we could be to work along with the quarantine but we had fresh air everywhere we went you could open your door and have fresh air and people saw that and went i'm not staying here no more so they're moving out and that should obviously you would think would show the head of that person who's in charge they don't like this they're leaving that means no votes that's right now no one's going to want to vote them back in you want to go through that again and no tax money you're right no tax money to take care of anything it's a mess it's all free if they say give it up give it all there give it all to us we'll just take care of you don't even think that's what's gonna happen you gave away your destiny your future your home your rights your rights your rights your rights that's what satan wants but he's not going to get away with it here say whoa to god so people have a lot of questions they'd like to ask me and we'd be here for 10 more hours and i wouldn't be sleeping people always invite me then if they ever ask me to visit their home they try so hard to stay up while i'm up and like falling asleep sitting next to me wanting to ask i don't do that anymore by the way i've actually spoken in um i remember the name of that great black university it's either maryland or washington dc i actually got to go speak there yeah george washington university yeah i did i was invited and they couldn't squeeze the people they couldn't get them they gave us a small room then bigger room in a bigger room because the students asked for it and they have to say yes and they had so many crammed in there you couldn't hardly breathe and the next night there was even more and i was staying in the home of this family nobody could stay up they're like i gotta go to sleep and i'm still sitting here you know in heaven you don't have to sleep people go i always wanted a bedroom done a certain way well you'll get it he'll make it for you to make you happy it'll be your lounge room your meditation room you don't need to meditate when you're living with the one that you meditate about your mansions are amazing some are under the crystal sea some are up in the skies of heaven they have a rain forest in heaven these 12 massive trees that could hold some i've seen mansions the size of new york city one one mansion probably belonged to an intercessor seriously somebody you never knew or heard of you know they prayed in every move of god until they were going on they're probably still praying when they were leaving and i like to tell these young people you may be living your life you want to but if you have a grandma in heaven she's going to pray the fire of god down on you because send the angels of heaven to pursue you and talk to the holy spirit non-stop you may as well get up here roll over and lay down and give up right now because they're gonna get you you'll listen to the prayers of your grandma i was in a where it was a fireman's sub i'll talk anywhere and somebody made a comment about my hair which god picked not me i did not pick this thing here i was not a pink hair person oh no remember i was the one that wanted to just hide i want to be invisible i was okay with being invisible he said you're not going to be invisible you're not going to be hiding anymore that's what he said to me we need you to have pink highlights in your hair now i had probably about 40 pastor friends in my city and then they thought that was it i went over the edge knowing me not changed but my pink hair made it impossible to to be friends with well what is wrong with these people oh they have no clue they're they're in the flesh not the spirit this is a spirit test if you don't like it you're in the flesh you like it you're walking in the spirit so i don't ask for it but you can't hide so everywhere i go and pastors go i can't invite you my congregation would freak out if they saw your pink hair i said you just didn't know how many hours they watched of me on youtube and guess what they come to my meetings at the church next door to you i don't think they're not the ones who aren't ready i think it's you so because of this pink hair it opens up me to speak about heaven everywhere everywhere everywhere all day all day no matter where it is it's even happened here already it doesn't matter people are attracted to it while your hair is amazing yeah the pastor should hear that right get your evangelistic team to get color colored highlights in their hair and send them out into the streets and see how many people they can draw it's great marketing and so they will say hey your hair's cool yeah this is heaven culture what does that mean that means i know god he asked me to have pink comets in his hair i've been to heaven they all have highlights what and they never say this you're lying this is what i'm not a non-believer no matter how on drugs whatever it is they'll go what did it look like you know their souls kind of loosened up because they've been taking something and what's in there will come out what did it look like i've had meetings at the cashier where the lines backing up and they're listening the bad boys are listening the bad boys at the next one cashier comes over so they can hear well i'm saying it's because of this pink hair so i understand jesus when he said we need you to have pink highlights in your hair and he can read my thoughts and i'm thinking in my head why and he looked at me says it's if the lord of glory ever says to you with all the love he has his heart it's necessary i don't care what he wants then he just keeps he keeps going we don't want you to be hidden you can't hide anymore we're going to market heaven with that pink hair we want people to know the truth we want to know it's not boring it's exciting it's powerful it's amazing i want you to know as a believer the authority and dominion that you have in this earth and it's okay if you cut color highlights in your hair you look like heaven angels are different colors they're not just all pasty white glowing with white wings in a white gown some would probably make you crawl under your seat they have a band around their head with eyes and that whole band they have they have this this whatever thing they call this thing a breastplate thank you yes they have eyes all through them in the front and the back their wings are made out of electricity or lightning their faces are angular their eyes are diamond shaped if one comes in your room it's not from hell and some of them can look really fierce really fierce like i have two heads one facing this way one facing that way they both look front and back no matter where they're turning they can see some are weapons they don't need to carry weapons i'm more acquainted with the army of heaven than gabriel's group i've seen gabriel's group i know my guardian angel i've known him since i was little he's 40 feet high i won't tell you his name ask god would you tell me what my angel's name is so i could say thank you you're not worshiping him and they won't let you worship them and an army doesn't get worship they want commands they need orders like this army they have generals they have privates they have commanders all kinds of levels in the army itself but we get to command because jesus christ did they were made for us to command they don't protect heaven not one angel there's not one angel buildings not one was designed to protect heaven from who from who the army didn't even get to throw them all out michael held him while god zapped him with a lightning bolt from himself it says i saw a satan fall as lightning well one third of the angels went right behind him he kicked them all out that was his um intolerance no tolerance for evil or wickedness he doesn't want us to tolerate it either your words your deeds what you choose what you say especially declare yourself into the spirit realm how you go get a staff it helps ram i declare a state will not have my neighborhood i come in the host of heaven to get into every single home leave the life of god in there speak to every person while they're sleeping drive out every demon from this place because i'm not living near them and i will not tolerate them and i won't then i went from that to my city then i went to that to my state driving all the witches out please don't dress like a witch on october 31st you're inviting them harvest festivals are one thing don't participate with satan's holiday my daddy always told me it was wrong i said to my grandmother and one day we realized it is wrong why would he have a holiday he deserves nothing remember that when you get invited to something one day we in one quest will have the biggest festivals of light all over the world on october 31st we will celebrate life the life of god his plans and we'll throw a party everywhere we go and tell people what hell is really like and so is halloween you don't want it you're participating don't look at me weird i've been to hell you don't want to participate it's all real his plans his revelation his son holy spirit christ wiping up hell on the third day they were screaming and running he was melting the faces of the hierarchy of hell enjoying it why did it say he made a show of it he was putting on a show in hell god put a show on in heaven right when he kicked him out christ put a show on in helm when he wiped him all out guess who gets to put the show on on the earth we do we do because of jesus for jesus and with jesus we will put the biggest show on ever that is why he calls us his sons and daughters that's why he says we will manifest his absolute power and authority in the earth it is our right as a born-again believer having invited jesus into our lives when i was four and i asked him in i saw him step in me i was four years old don't discount your little kids i liked it so much when i was five i did it again so in book one i said i got born again at four on book five book two hey don't tell me there's five and book two i said i got saved to five and this woman who loved everything i had been saying and receiving it when she found out she said you lied this is a legalist minded person you lied you said you were born again at four and you said five you didn't even remember i said excuse me i did it twice maybe you should maybe you should do it again in the assemblies of god we got saved every week we did whether we needed to or not we still got saved oh the baptist did it all the time they're doing everybody's neighborhood in their yard it doesn't matter the baptists are great soul winners y'all they really are they're very bold [Music] but don't let the watchtower people come in your home they'll want to give you their watchtower magazine burn it or shred it it's false religion all false religions are run by one person that satan is called an antichrist spirit remember jesus talked about it that means anything is against christ's sovereignty and his his holiness of who he is his his anything is against that that speaks against that isn't antichrist spirit let's all stand up for a minute come back tomorrow i hope you come back tomorrow you hear about america a lot what'd you say wear red white and blue please i'll be wearing red white and blue i will and heaven will be wearing it too whoever watches whoever comes will i was recently in um not con carpenter's home church it was the name of the church in orlando calvary assembly of god i was there invited with a lot of other prophets who were taken out of their box because jeff jansen was in charge and he never has a program or a schedule you flow with him so all these great leaders are all sitting up on the platform and and jeff would just say get up there and start speaking and they're like they'd look at me because i'm a friend right he made me sit beside him or behind him in case i was the only one responding here's mike go go say something and they go what does he want to say oh you'll find out when you get up there then he calls us all said well what are we doing it doesn't matter let's just go up here and see what he wants to say it was powerful and we actually got to pray for the president because that was the the night i think it was released that he had was tested positive it was a it was it was a wild time because a lot of these people are like i've never done this before in my life you mean they don't actually have a schedule there's when is it going to end oh when he's done it ends when he's done he's flowing with the spirit of god it was a lot of fun it was powerful but most of them didn't know me and they looked strange but benny hinn turned around and shook my hand said i'm so glad you're here it was yeah his wife wants to be a new best friend suzanne she was excited about everything so you never know when god's gonna take you out of your box you may have been taken out of your box tonight

let's honor cat as she comes this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] very good [Music] [Applause] before you sit down let's do something let's look up to heaven and welcome heaven how about that say father we are your children [Music] we love your son he lives in us this day we want to honor you and all those in heaven so we invite heaven to join us in this meeting so come quickly and enjoy the fun [Applause] y'all can sit down okay that's good well there's a lot of glory in here whoa yeah if you have never felt it it's real the more sensitive you are why do some people fall not fall it's not that something i want to do the more sensitive you become to him to jesus christ the more sensitive you become to the holy spirit and their presence because he's always with you and actually they're always talking to you when you learn how to tune that in tune the world out and tune it in you begin to hear them and it might be that still small voice but it's still them i always say them you hear me say them a lot i said it so many times someone said who are you talking about the trinity it's not one without the other right they've always been they've always existed they have no beginning no end i like the no end part i get crazy questions sometimes like will this all end and everyone just stop existing and went no way that's never gonna happen and you may never know everything about them because you'll always be learning and growing closer i'm talking about in eternity i mean you know you're actually already in eternity if you're a believer it's not like you're waiting on it okay it's just another season of your life but while you're here you have all got important commissions but if you're alive in this time you have extremely important commissions and one of those will be carrying the glory a lot of people i won't be talking about america obviously thank you everybody for wearing your red white and blue [Applause] the angels are in this room are wearing red white and blue just so you know that the ones that signed here especially because i asked would you please wear red white and blue god loves the red white and blue it represents his son i don't know if you ever knew that those stripes what do you think that represents it really does that's what it represents so the red and white and blue is his our president is his our country is his you ever wonder who to vote for always vote for life say life remember what god said i offer you you choose life or death but choose life right so this time it is about a man and god chose that man i talked somehow god talked mostly last night if you weren't here we actually heard from god himself speaking and he does that with me pretty often the more freedom in the atmosphere where i go the greater change you have of hearing from him because i didn't know he was going to do that but he has permission to use me any way he wants to i hear prophets say well i think the word of the lord is and what they need more maturity it's okay to open your mouth and let god speak and he does he does and he always will do that he loves to speak to his people but even people he'll speak to people who aren't his yet catch him up to heaven when they come back they want to know him they want to know jesus christ i know several times where things like that happen not in my meetings people haven't caught up a few times in my meetings mostly when they leave a lot of people see their guardian angel after they leave the meetings and that's okay don't worship them [Laughter] they won't let you that whole thing that has gone through the church for so many years uh it went from don't worship angels to don't talk to them have nothing to do with them and and yet in the bible itself not just the new testament in the old testament they actually had a little bit more freedom because there was no internet there was no fake news there was no liberals or legal list of people who said oh don't do that because they didn't know yet and and i can't i count on both hands how many and some weren't even like great men and women of god they were just people who god needed to do something and he would send angels why in the world do you think they have couriers now anyone who's been in a courier service understands how important that is heaven has courier angels they're under gabriel they're messengers couriers they have all types of angels worker angels uh ones that deliver things some that come and record things every person whoever got born again was recorded by angels is that important to god it was all recorded and not just what people saw with their natural eyes but what was happening in the spirit realm when you get born again the father son and holy spirit are all present when that happens because the father is fiercely loves everybody and if you could see with your own eyes i know when i was born again i was four i knew exactly what i was doing i saw jesus step inside of me i've always been a seer so i would not talk a lot about it to anybody when i was real little but i'd always see angels and sometimes the other guys you know so i'm not really afraid of them because i know that they're the losers and they have no power over me now i'm not letting them beat me up they're not going to kill steal and destroy anything of mine and that should be coming out of your mouth it's called ruling and taking dominion jesus said occupy until i come he didn't say stood on your rapture rug so the holy spirit had us make some pens that said roll up your rapture rug he actually came and said that tell everybody roll up your wraps your rug is not going to happen right now stick it in the closet maybe someone in the generations to come might want it you need to get your crown on it's more important to wear your crown than sit on your rapture rock because if you sit on the rapture road you'll probably never get to wear your crown or use it we all have crowns when you're a believer but what you do with that that that represents your authority and dominion when you get christ you get so many things but at that ceremony that's what heaven calls when somebody repents receives christ as a savior the father reaches inside of himself takes a stone of fire and puts it in that person's spirit man and that's what brings light it puts light in your spirit man that light can grow and grow and grow the more you pursue christ the more you obey the more you're willing the light grows and grows and grows and i can look at people and already know what have you been doing or yay [Laughter] some people are never told what you've been told what you're hearing but but from the moment we receive christ that is the first step the most necessary thing yes but after that you're supposed to run your race and go from glory to glory and you are more than a conqueror it's not like you're conquering you're taking the territory that christ already conquered for us to occupy means take authority and take dominion and take territory because we rule in the spirit realm but where you live the ground the air any water bodies wild around you anywhere you have rulership over all of that in the spirit realm you have a realm it comes with your christianity with your salvation and also at that time christ also takes something from himself the anointing he walked in this is all scriptural how about that this is the best part i know the word i was raised from the time i was a little baby my dad devoured the word and he actually lived it he loved his enemies like he did his friends so there was no skin color to us they were people that god loved and that we cared about very much we have adopted members of our family from almost every race my mom's sitting right there when people meet her i want you to be my mama so she had 15 but there's like 16 17 18 19 we ran out of numbers because they want to be a part of what we carry it's called love so christ reaches in himself and he takes a deposit of the anointing he walked in how do i know that because of first john 2 27 you see rick knows the walking bible back there if you want to know about a scripture ask rick he knows it and see rick i know this one the word actually tells you that it says when you receive jesus christ as your savior you receive a deposit of the anointing that lives and it abides in you guess what it doesn't go back to heaven it's given to you for a purpose it is a weapon and it's only yours it's yours everybody has one you're a believer but it's a deposit of the anointing he walked in so the father gives you something a stone of fire and you put more facets in it the more you do the more you grow the more you love the more you walk out the word and and carry the glory your facets the facets and that gemstone would blind the enemy that gemstone also has fire on it so here's the father giving you deposit of himself when you receive his son you get all of this you get all the holy spirit is right there all right he writes down okay i will begin to pursue them for me to indwell them but when you're born again he doesn't ignore you holy spirit is you can say holy spirit you don't have to say thee he's not an it he's a third member of the trinity he is also god right and they all have their they have their favorite things like we do their next favorite colors favorite foods jesus is just really got this serious thing about sweets he doesn't want deliverance from it though did you know he has his own mansion in heaven did he walk as a man on this earth doesn't he deserve one jesus doesn't live in this wrong room he visits much many many times he's there most of the time he's all around heaven saying hello to people you know just blinding you with his love and his glory but he actually has his own place and it sits in this field of these flowers that sing and worship him all the time now these flowers are like eight ten foot tall and you can't see the end of these flowers and his mansion is made very particular because he likes three things well he likes celebrations for sure but he likes sweets right he loves to dance he loves being with people so his mansion is different he's got one massive ballroom in it and all along the walls are these very beautiful probably made by him he still does carpentry in heaven all these wonderfully embellished tables and all of them have desserts on them he was raised on honeycomb and that never left him he loved going to weddings because guess what they always had lots of people sweets and they danced so because your mansion is made for you exactly the things you love the things you really love to do that you love to eat uh places and play i mean your mansion i've seen one the size of new york city so don't think you have a little cabin unless it's inside your mansion you know he'll do if you really want one he'll stick it in your mansion unless your mansion looks like you know a 50 000 square foot cabin most mansions don't have ceilings in them they don't need them it's easier for the angels to fly in and out or the creatures in heaven that come by to say hi if you have trees growing out of the floor that will talk to you and have conversations they come from the friendly forest does it say that the trees clap their hands it does and they really do so jesus has a one of the biggest places of celebration once you arrive and you have your welcome home party in the throne room and your family finally drags you out of there schambach stayed like forever some people just love being in that presence which is a massive celebration they don't have funerals in heaven they have celebrations and they have parties you don't need any alcohol you are drunk on the spirit all the time really people will step over you in the streets of gold because you're besotted with the presence and the all and the glory and the glory is one of the things i'll talk about this really i said god in the red white and blue it's really about the glory of what god's going to do with america i thought i'd share a little bit of heaven who's never heard anyone talk about heaven like that anybody if you've been there a lot you would be some people are afraid to i have a commission i have to share i i have a commission god came to me jesus christ came to me and said the father and i have decided to take you on tours of heaven that was over 20 years ago there's no way i can be normal when anyone dies i have a party inside the family doesn't call me unless they're ready to have a party because i've been at funerals and the and the ceiling is open and the person who died is looking at themselves in their casket your spiritual body goes to heaven your physical body is what rest right you're going to get it back you're going to get it back it's okay it's going to look really good and the day the dead in christ shall rise that is your body and your spirit man if you're already in heaven you're not going to miss that you can't you get it back first because you come in the clouds right with jesus you get your physical body first and anyone left on the earth that is born again they get their body glorified so it's okay to go home for half to heaven for some rnr because most people go i'm going to be here i want to be here when the rapture happens i'm like why are you going to know about it before anybody down here trust me they'll all know in heaven before it ever happens so i hope that helps some people they miss the rapture oh let me tell you they were raptured when they got here the moment you step from this physical body the presence of god and the love of god consumes your spiritual person you are seeing your guardian angels for the first time who never leave you they actually escort you to heaven and they've been with you your whole life yay i've always been nice to mine they had to put up with me growing up i wasn't bad i just wasn't a real happy person but anyway no i can see mine i see him all the time and when when god sends you into something new for him you get more okay you all have more than one because one has to stay here while the other one goes home for r and r remember what it says that your angel is always beholding the face of the father that's because one is here and one's up there at least many people have many and they come when you're conceived at the time of conception life begins because that is when your little spirit man is brought from heaven by holy spirit and he knits and attaches that little dot that little dot of flesh that's beginning to form in your mother's womb he takes your little spiritual man it's still you you've always been you just lived in god played like a little child somewhere about this big this big your different sizes you have these little shift things on you swim in the river of life you run up and down on the stones of fire you slide down the holy mountain you have a lot of fun you ride in and out on the rays of the rainbow that come out of him but you can't go any further you don't live in heaven somewhere you live in him in him we live we move we have our very being the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things what things when you lived inside the father why is he called the father why are we called his offspring i hope that makes sense to your head he carried us he carried us inside of himself and he said when i made the womb of a woman that's why i put water in it so it'd be familiar because you lived in him you played in the river of life he's very focused and the father is an extremely detailed person that's why he can put up with me my husband he gave me was probably the only person who ever could because he's got five layers to his soul he's happy if i love him and feed him and he can fish he doesn't have any more demands and so god picked him before he sent me he sent me first four years later my husband was sent into the womb of his mother but god picked us and he brought us together and 43 years later here we are he still loves me still loves food still loves fishing god is very detailed and focused when he made you and we are so amazingly made scientists still can't figure out how we can do different things how does our body operate the way it does it couldn't without a maker we didn't climb out of a slime pond the only big bang that happened was when satan was cast out of heaven [Applause] that's about it that's the big bang and it's not a theory it's the truth nope we have all been from the end of the beginning in the beginning beginning to the end when we lived in him because he went there is that what it says yeah and when jesus was called the word it was the father the word and holy spirit until the word came to die for us and was jesus christ his whole life changed i mean everything changed he had to change everything he was all spirit he didn't even look like he he looked different with flesh on um lucifer did not recognize him satan didn't recognize him lucifer that's who satan was before he fell was the most beautiful being in all of heaven god put gemstones all over him for a reason in his wings all just all over him when he would lead worship and the rays of glory would come from him they would hit the gems on lucifer and throw that rainbow like all over heaven he was anointed to carry that glory until he decided he wanted to steal it and you think about how long see heavens already had a war they understand the angels lost friends did you ever think about that they've been around together for a long long time and even though the army is very focused on what they do the army is the army they're called the hosts and if you met one they wouldn't want to be called an angel i know people who have met one more than one but the the army is the one i'm most connected with and god taught me to be a commander so you all could learn how to command god said command you me what he's saying is let me see you command when you learn in the word many times when it was either the fathers or the holy spirit whatever they said that was recorded in the bible sometimes if you turn the scripture around you see the whole revelation in it so if you take command ye me me i will see you command that's what he meant but so many scholars were freaked out that's revelation they were so freaked out why would god we cannot command him let's don't even discuss this don't you ever talk about this in your meetings because because and yet no ye not that ye are gods they don't want to talk about either that's with the little g that just means you can you you inside of you you have the ability to command the army of heaven only as a believer if you're not a believer none of these will you're here listening because you can't do any of it you must be born again to have this authority this dominion and all these things that god has given us if he says let's make man in our image and after the way we operate if jesus said i give you power over some of the power of the enemy say that loud then why don't we take it he says satan comes around like a roaring lion and coming to seek he can kill steal and destroy he didn't say he had the right to do it however it also says that he gives us mighty weapons he gives us weapons they that not an it you don't just give us a sword or a gun you know although it's okay to have those to defend yourself so i'm on the side of keep your guns and there's a reason why in this world you know while there's a devil who hates everybody and they have wicked evil people uh it's okay to defend yourself that's what makes us not a third world country it also makes us not communist and makes us not socialist that's called control that's called you have no life and you own nothing so those people talking about that stuff don't even know what they're saying let's send them to venezuela or russia let's send them to one of those countries let them have a week's vacation there they come back screaming we don't want to do that you have power and we have the right to rule and reign is says so besides the fact that he says you are kings and priests those are royal levels of authority and dominion those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion again if you're not born again you don't have any this is for the body of christ and all they're told is get saved and hang on to jesus comes and most denominations that's what they tell you go get people saved bring them in we'll pray they stay that way we are living examples in every sense of the word we don't have to tolerate anything from hell or anything from the enemy you know why because guess who didn't say jesus christ if we are joint heirs having been in law for eight years in my life i got a big lesson on what that meant and you all know why is it called the new testament that was his last will and testament that is a legal document sincerely of your rights and your inheritance and your abilities and your authority what he put in there's what we have and they stand up here just read them like they're really nice they sing their three songs and you go home totally unchanged unless you are personally pursuing a relationship with christ that's not who we are that's right we're not here just trying to get by we have given promises by jesus himself written in his word and is like if you took it to the court of heaven they would be saying well why aren't you doing this or saying this or why haven't you activated this why aren't you using their weapons what's wrong with the army of heaven are they not strong enough or have you not activated them in your life aren't you sending them against the enemy's strongholds trying to tear you apart and steal from you if you went up there without asking for stuff if you said explain this to me that's what you would hear well let's just unroll your bill of rights and clearly explain to you what we we should and then how to use them it is our job to train you you come to get trained if you're not trained you didn't get what you needed so people say you're going to start a church absolutely not thank you god in heaven i'm not a pastor one of the hardest jobs on the earth think how many kids you got right i already did that at home but you have to look at your life you have to look at your life a whole different way like what was christ saying what did that really mean is that something i have he said yes and the hard-headed man he was given because the father said i didn't give make it easy for my son then he takes me back in time and i get to walk behind the merry men and jesus on the way to go minister somewhere like i didn't have a vision and i never dream i don't sleep long enough i was there i saw people throwing rocks at the tax collector this is jesus's merry men following him he's trying to ignore most of them there is peter trying to yell at everybody about what they were doing wrong right this is exactly what they did patience that belongs to luke we're running down the road why did you give us up for him this is reality right he's been a physician for a long time he had a lot of patience let me tell you when you have a good doctor you don't want to lose them well he wasn't doing that anymore he gave it up but they didn't want to give him up this is exactly what i was showing and i went i'll never complain about my staff again and this is early on when he had his 12. the hardest ones to get roped in were james and john the sons of thunder that didn't mean thunder from god that means they were fighting all the time over pretty girls who thought they were awesome they had to get rid of the flesh when you think about what they became in a three short years it's absolutely amazing because no coach here on the earth could believe it could take that many people from different circumstances and ages and thoughts and everything you know and here was the son of glory saying i saw you when you were under the tree there earlier talking and said what he said that wasn't normal multiplied the foods there was so much left over from a couple fish which i don't like couple fish and loads of bread they could have had mine i would have given them mine baskets full left over now that was not normal was it when he disappeared into the spirit he stepped into the spirit room like this and he walked through the people when they were going to throw him over the cliff he actually said he passed through the people you know that right people go well he went around that's not what it says the orthodox jews knew he was a good man they thought he was a prophet they caught they gave him that benefit i know some they think he's a prophet and when he was having his meeting there after him they believe because i heard it face to face on a tour to israel uh which they hooked a mic on me and with steve schultz of elijah list they recorded every time i prophesied god said something somewhere and we were at the mount the precipice and so this orthodox jew was given his spin on it and he said yes the crowds wanted to kill him they didn't like it that he was good and he was doing good so they lowered a rope his disciples down the side of the mountain i saw the side of that mountain that rope would have been 250 300 feet long who's going to carry a rope around on a wagon right it's not like a little road and i'm thinking that's not even in the natural and so of possible all the believers are like just kind of staring at him but that's what they believe he let himself down no but then it was my turn to give revelation on where we were and i said well you all realize jesus as as the son of god although he walked as a man that is true he also was the son of god but even walking as a man he learned truth about the spirit realm the unseen realm it's a real place it supersedes the physical realm that's why angels and spiritual beings can pass through this wall they do it a lot sometimes you see them sometimes you don't but they have the ability but but jesus learned that he himself he was headed he had a spirit man inside he had a body but he already learned that he had access to that spirit realm so when this crowd came upon him this is all he had to do there are slits and openings everywhere if you step in you cannot be seen but you see everybody around you oh yeah like if i disappeared i would see everybody here i could hear you but you couldn't see or hear me so to you i would be invisible so what he did was when they were coming after him he just probably backstepped disappeared and he walked through the bodies of the people because the spirit supersedes the physical realm so he walked through the crowds right through their bodies until he got where he wanted to he stepped out of the spirit realm and there he was but guess what we are joint heirs and the things he did the works he did we will do also and greater things than that will we do there's now i won't tell this this is going from glory to glory there are requirements and some people don't like to hear that so people who are full of their self selfish spewing stuff these are christians i'm talking about because there's no way now i can tell you this the devil knows about the spirit realm and a lot of people in the new age movement have spirit guides those are demons and they'll take them in there but this is the thing this is why they're so insistent that that stuff is real they had a real encounter and because that doesn't mean what you're seeing is real that's why you must test every spirit and almost nobody says that or talks about that if an angel appeared in this room and said come and go with me i would say are you the spirit of the most high god who sent his son to die for the sins of this world and they can't lie so if he said yes i am the father has sent you i'd go with him if he said nothing or looked terrified i say get out i evict you get out i have nothing to do with you and that's what the basic probably one of the most important things that every believer will ever learn when you get born again because that's the moment the enemy really begins to pursue you he doesn't want you to be he didn't want you to know who you are see then then he's losing territory he's losing his impact he won't have a way to hold on to you or use you but this is one of the things jesus did he did it quite often he taught who fill up everybody say phillip say in the new testament philip travel through the spirit realm he would appear somewhere and then he would be gone he would be found in another place he traveled through the spirit realm just like christ did but people who sit in a church with the pastor doesn't have an understanding of the spirit realm the purposes god made it and what our rights are and how you do this is things you do you sent out assignments by god and and probably 20 40 50 60 years from now that might be a normal way of transportation let's say you're going to india to preach the gospel you may just step i don't know i don't know how he'll do it you could step in a certain room and then when you come out you're in india that was spirit realm you don't need a passport you don't need luggage and when you're done you probably turn around and step and you're back home this is our future [Music] now doesn't that make christianity a little bit more exciting there are people who are already connected with god with holy spirit and have an understanding of the spirit realm these people who just kind of astral project themselves out places that's something they're doing from their own soul it's dangerous you're out there with no one protecting you helping you and you're just bait the enemy can send these spirit guides if you do that and they'll take you to places and tell you all kinds of lies about where they're taking you and give you a commission because you had a real encounter you believe that was true and it wasn't so even some pastors who know are afraid to tell you should you misuse it should you misuse it or try it or something but it is our right to have an understanding of who we are so did jesus do those things and philip he's not the only one who travels but john did it all the time he left the isle of patmos when he felt like it you know why they put him there he wasn't even in a jail because that would be useless john they tried killing him so many times and they were terrified that he wouldn't die they couldn't even hurt him when they boiled him in oil he probably asked for a rubber ducky in the scrub bush john was sort of like peter at one time but now he spoke with confidence he knew who he was he knew he was under divine protection he was afraid of nobody so he would say boldly whatever god gave him when he went somewhere so that would be the best thing we can do is put them away from everybody on an island not realizing he was in the spirit on the lord's day which means he was in that spiritual realm when he heard the voice he looked up saw the door open and he was up in heaven the spirit realm is a place it is a place it's not just something you say but john who was the closest to jesus of all the disciples who never abandoned him not even at the cross that's why he gave his mother to john he had to die as his mother's savior not as her son that's why he said mother mom this is your son's son this is your mother he still recognizes that she birthed him in heaven she's highly honored not worshipped she's not she's not a deity [Laughter] she's very much loved because it took a lot had divine encounter with angels a good thing she was willing to listen to them right and then even joseph think about that that was tough when you do something great for god's surrender will always be required to some people that sounds like control and so they're afraid and if anybody's ever been in like a occult not occult occult that's satan's but a cult can be a christian cult you join it you live on land they get to tell you what to do and not to do it's still a form of control they think they're doing out of to help you but it's not some tell you who you can marry who you cannot marry i know people who were in one of those and they will not sign any kind of a document for anybody because they were under control when they got free they don't want they don't want to ever be controlled again by people so they're not a good thing either okay you don't need people to take you and keep you in a compound somewhere and run your whole life for you that's not god and they love and some of them love jesus and they may have their little church and worship and stuff but they have no rights really it's not a good thing it's certainly not god right so the i've known people who've been through that so they don't if you say well we have uh this we're having everybody to sign a covenant with us to be a part of what we're doing they won't sign it even though it has nothing to do with controlling them or anything they just won't do it they won't do it and i said well i'll just give you give you time pray for you you need to release all that from your soul and be free from that experience you had but especially if things hurt you or things happen to you and that it's not good you are responsible for yourself and the family god gave you and you're shaping i guess my sign to take a drink all this is coming to one thing it's about carrying the glory around america but i experienced last night yes god did step into me and i had waves i felt like this cloud came when i stepped out of the vehicle a cloud came and just i saw the cloud and i heard the father speaking so all the way in that's why i couldn't walk i didn't feel like i was here most of the time i didn't feel like even standing there if i moved and looked at somebody they would go they'd go like this and i have only encountered that one at the time when because this is saying what you're willing to talk about to people you're going to do it he needs voices to speak about the things he wants for us so they know this is something he has right if you're living if you're playing with sin it's not going to happen because you're a testimony right you're manifesting for him with these signs and wonders and greater works and he can't give those to people who are going to play in the darkness and go to church play in the darkness go to church and people know that and they see you doing this stuff they're it's gonna bring confusion so even though people have faked a lot of things they can fake being in the five-fold ministry they can fake all kinds of things one thing they cannot fake is carrying the glory or the fire and manifesting for god because he'll just take everything away so these are different days these are powerful days just doing the works is powerful like walking on water right multiplying food raising the dead who've been dead a long time you know or just maybe a few days who knows [Laughter] this is what i say if you're dead you're dead if he wants you you're not coming back if these are believers if he wants you or if he gives you a choice and you're in heaven be the hardest thing in their existence to be in the presence of the living god and his son in and holy spirit in heaven itself everything is alive there's more life there than anything ever so when they die their body does but they don't they step into real life they're very much alive declaring over you believing for you to be great for him instead of actually says in the bible if they could come back it'd be for one thing to be a part of what's going on now that's how important these days are and so i've been talking quite a bit about the days of glory it says that the knowledge of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea there's two things you need to realize there's two thirds of water on this earth that's significant when he says like the waters cover the sea that's much more water than land and what he's trying to say is you go many times over you will carry that glory you won't go somewhere and say glory come it'll be in you and it's released and it does huge things when you release it the knowledge isn't just oh it's the glory it's the understanding of what it is and what it does the knowing the understanding and the experiencing of it so you will do that and the glory grows in you like a cloud and at one point now this happened to me because i've been talking about it at this little place in missouri and went back to the products table and i started walking back and people started just falling and i'm like i could feel this power of god his power the glorious power it comes from him it's what's around him on the throne on the father his son carried it on this earth and so we we each get a measure remember things are given in measures but it can grow so i've been talking my son-in-law was with me handling the products table who's like an irish he's quite a character he's born again he's he's uh he is fearless and so he was a great addition to our family it took him to be able to marry my daughter who's just like me prayed prayed him in and prayed everybody else away i ran off every guy that was the wrong guy it didn't take much to make trips to heaven over time would you like to go one was a baptist boy bless his little heart my daughter is a seer she prophesies she knows all about these things i know she probably hadn't told you that uh and and i go to heaven all the time non-stop would you like to be able to do that this whole time he's backing up right it's getting big i said the kids you have will become prophets and seers they'll travel to the spirit realm they'll grab about one in heaven and just scare this little guy so much no i'm going to marry her she's going to have my 2.5 children i don't know what that and she will only do what i can tell i tell her she can do you have not known my daughter for very long that will never happen [Laughter] and i kept trying to show my daughter this this is not love it was like it was like they liked they liked the idea of being married don't get fooled okay you don't have to ask somebody if you are in love to somebody you cannot live without that's filled with god and you are so overwhelmed that the blessing god has given you if you have to come up and say do you think i'm in love [Laughter] no and so i told they were planning their wedding and everything and i want you're not going to be happy why don't you go visit his house and his dad was a fully in charge baptist he had to give permission to everybody around the table to speak oh yeah yeah her eyes start to get is this okay to tell stories on myself see i've experienced this self i know you don't want to meet the wrong person she comes back she goes i said how was it the food was good but i already knew because i'm a seer i can see where they are i can see what's going on when they're not with me how about that for a parent i know where you are right now if you don't get out of that movie i'll be there in 15 minutes we'll have revival in the theater and by the way there will be a repentance thing you can sign and take communion before you come back in the house that was growing up with me jen's raising her hand because jesus lived with me and my mom they loved me since 1999 so they know all this stuff they saw all this stuff happen she knows [Laughter] see i'm telling the truth that's what happens when you're here but it's the relationship i had and so i kept telling my daughter you're not in love you're not marrying that boy i'll lay down in the aisle well i'm telling i was telling all these things you know we'll have deliverance service serve all the baptists [Music] and i have very good baptist friends okay there'd be a lot of people in hell right now if i had meant for them but there's no way that with that was not a match made in heaven they'd be doing like this because my daughter is just like me in every way and out of the three the only one about heads with is guess who but they're raising their kids in the supernatural yeah so finally it's good so i told my daughter i'm going to fast dr pepper now that for me was like i'm pouring my life out right the biggest fast i could do because i only eat once a day there's not much to eat so i'm fasting dr pepper for three weeks at the end of that three weeks you will come to me and say i don't want him anymore but i have met this person at the end of three weeks guess what happened mom how do i break up with scott why did i think it was anything i have met ben she never said scott like that she never said scott ah scott's coming over [Laughter] yes bless his little heart he found him a nice little baptist girl and they're very happy just so you know that okay he didn't damage him and there was batten and i interrogated everybody who came up my husband laid back you know let's go fishing man [Laughter] it's the only break they'll ever get so when i met ben oh by the way in this whole process of realizing scott wasn't the right person she rebelled against him she got a mohawk [Laughter] her hair was like down here she got herself a mohawk and then the holy spirit had told her to put lightning bolts tattoo them on her sides get ready for kids for today y'all and she has uh gifted and danced highly i mean highly anointed and so when she was like 14 the holy spirit came to again and said i want you to put brass knuckles on your feet because they're weapons of god and they're like this long no she don't do anything little so she came and showed them to us after y'all and i went if god and god told me i did tell her to do that she's a sign and a wonder and she got to minister so many places and they she had red and purple hair i mean just just tell me she was so far out there in the heaven culture it was crazy she needed ben and the holy spirit calls him the irish boy with charmin blarney who pulls down you know he displaces principalities with the army of heaven and i went you were made for her [Laughter] it's worth standing in the gap for your children that they have the one god needs them to have your life is a journey but you don't ever ever have to be in a pit never and even if your children end up by running with the enemy they're up and out of home running for the enemy just let them know i love you i'm running after jesus but he will get you and they see you not messed up or upset or torn apart because jesus the joy of the lord is your you can be strong all the time you couldn't go after them anyway that would be havoc then you would be torn apart and then they would isolate you okay they got to live their life and make the choices you stand in that gap i believe and declare my child will know jesus christ become a witness for him and we'll be together in eternity and i'm running after jesus and eventually one day they'll come to you and say i need help if they want to come back home you better have a list of guidelines already prepared don't let hell in your home because you're trying to help your kids i'm serious that that would be the enemy's plan if you're willing to follow the guidelines i don't care if they're 40 or 30. it is your realm you create a habitation for heaven and god will make sure you know they don't die in the ditch somewhere but they have to learn they can't use you or take advantage of you because you love them this is truth i want you to have a glorious life and you have authority over all that junk but the glory of god is something he does talk about us having and we carry it and we release it and everywhere we go it will so impact it's like taking bazookas into an area where the enemy is trying to control and they just shoot it really shoots into those demons and it terrifies them it will begin to cover people like a cloud whole area sometimes whole cities will be covered with the glory you carry somewhere it's coming from you so when i got back to the room the other night i was still being consumed by this power of god that was he was here trust me he was here and he spoke last night and i was thanking him for letting me experience all that he says i need to let you know that glory was coming from you that wasn't mine that was coming from you that's what you already carry then i got undone we're entering into powerful days it's not about your age or where you came from what profession you have it is about your relationship with jesus christ and in heaven everyone in heaven is in love with him everybody they still love their family here but he is they're number one he is so it is is a profound thing and a high honor to carry parts of them the fire and the glory it all comes from them all of it say all that can't come from your physical being is something that has to do with your spirit man inside of you and that your soul has agreed to give god permission to do whatever he wants to with you and then when he says something do it right the more you do it the more he gives you that's like a job if you work well well in the past it used to mean that if you got a job you worked hard work well we're honest and hard you got promoted above everybody else some companies are still like that but it's always that way with god he doesn't love one person more than the other but some he can use more than the other don't let jealousy consume you don't covet somebody else's anointing you have your own remember first john 2 27 the more you release the anointing you know what the anointing looks like it looks like a blue fire it looks like blue fire we're going to stir up the anointing today and i'm going to release the glory on y'all but america's greatest call it has is to be a country known because it belongs to god and the glory of god will cover this land it will create regions of light those who refuse it will have regions of darkness until jesus comes all the darkness isn't going to just evaporate off the earth but there'll be seasons where it's pushed back and crushed back until it will have to have a region of darkness to operate in these are powerful times people who live in the regions of glory you'll get to choose there won't be an in between he's erasing the great area that says there is no god even in what he's doing right now to this whole election thing he's exposing the souls of men as a man think is in his soul or his heart so is he so why are these people hating wanting to kill wanting to control and you know they're doing that but i think they're dictators over states or cities not even realizing in their own head i have no way to be reelected that's right if i'm crushing the life out of the people i'm supposed to be leading and watching over why would they want that again they're moving to states where they don't have control because they're tired of it these aren't even people who are christians they're just good moral people i call them the moral majority who want life who actually do care about the life of the unborn they may not know jesus but they have a life they have a family they want a future that's the majority along with the believers who will vote trump in because they've already they've seen his witness and testimony is he's already been doing that and so the enemy satan is so terrified because he's planning to take over our country and make it his own and that's not going to happen it isn't i don't care what the news says they don't know how to do anything but lie even the polls i give are like almost insane the polls biden's uh 80 ahead and i went where are the people voting for and who would that be the ones he bought or the ballots they stole no even god says they're stealing even he tells me they're stealing ballots and then they're going to harvest them and thumb and dump dumpsters and i'm going to expose it i mean the enemy is doing whatever he pays off people to vote more than once and states that you could do that i mean they're they're really doing that they are corrupt and they may have been nice loving people one point but when you give yourself to the darkness it will consume you to a point where you're blinded and you don't even know that you just know that you really they really really believe they're going to win because of the news the fake news lying they watch it they believe the lie this is true hillary fainted when she found out she didn't win she knew even though she had no people it's the truth she wouldn't even appear she fainted people had to get psychiatric help because they were convinced in their soul by the lies they believed a lie so when they didn't win they fell apart they sincerely needed psychiatric help and all these years have gone by they're still getting fed with the same lies or more lies they're so so corrupted they even treat their families different some families have been separated business partners businesses have churches have separated my head can't wrap around how can a pastor say to vote for the other side when they want to kill babies oh it is i'm going to always give you the truth this is the truth you cannot side with the darkness and i personally know people sweetest people you ever knew are so filled with hate they hate hate hate trump i can't say his name i can't bring one thing about him and i'm like what happened to you they watch the fake news and and this is the thing they're not just watching it they're believing it the more you believe it is real even on the wrong side the more real it becomes and that's what's wrong with those people believers you cannot choose death you're surrendering authority over the enemy you do when you choose what the enemy wants you watering down your authority you can't you can't choose it's okay to kill you have given authority by christ but you walk in the light remember that walk in the spirit walk in the light follow after him we know what he thinks about it we know what the father thinks about it he's sending these little babies and then the point of time he needs them on the earth satan has a plan this is his plan if i can kill them remember when he killed him first time in egypt remember that he didn't want moses to deliver a person to be mourned so what did he do he killed babies right then the whole abortion thing started because he doesn't want somebody to be born who will have a voice that will speak the truth and the life and the power of god to people so he'll just wipe out as many as he can so that's why that's the truth about why abortion started that was satan's plan just don't let him live don't let him laugh his new thing he's using is homosexuality do you know why that all came up not just to steal people's destinies no babies born this is absolute truth from god he wants to stop god's plans for the people he made so whatever he can bring a lie if you can get people to believe a lie this is really who you are you're not this person you know this your other person well guess what two guys can't have a baby and do women get a baby so the bottom line is he doesn't want him born that's why it's going to be great when abortion is outlawed i've seen the place in heaven where all these little babies are kept and loved and nurtured and if they have family members there they will eventually get these little babies and they get to raise them if their parents make it if their parents were involved in that repent and get born again they get that little baby back that's how good god is that's how good god is so when you see the big or you're getting a big picture how important it is for us to live our life for him not just once a week you go to sleep living for him you wake up living for him running your race powerfully taken power and authority over the enemy wherever there is destruction wherever there is evil you can send the army to pull down strongholds shred platforms because all of the evil on the earth is still is still controlled by satan he finds people who are willing to do it people who don't even know there is a god you know and some other countries is far worse than is here far worse you know evil is or the power of evil unless you go to some of those third world countries america is one of the greatest countries in the world because we're founded by christian principles god is on our papers that's what he says to me all the time one nation under god is one of the lines satan hates the most he don't want him he doesn't want him involved anywhere in our lives or in this country but he isn't going to stop it so we will be a living example here the body of christ in this country of who god is and that he is he does live that christ lives that we have authority over things they're going to see things people will begin to run after christians to be their friend in the in the months and years ahead because they see things happening to them but they realize they're prospering these years of prosperity and in increase of in every way of revelation with the ideas and inventions god's going to give a lot of that to believers so people will have to get get stuff from them so we can't hide we can't run to the hills and hide take vacation but you can't preach this gospel to the bears and raise your children to do the same god is a generational god and children will be powerful in the earth and and there will be a point in this country at least nobody can have abortions it will become [Applause] illegal so god has his timeline and he knows who inside him he's already picked up generations and said you be this you'll be the aunt you'll be the uncle and you'll be in this generation 20 years later this one will be born and will carry this on and carry on generational lines or call on generations and so this is why it's important when he sends them they get to stay amen there is something that happens every now and then because he's god if he sends one and his life gets ended quickly he will take the whole spirit back and rescind it that's probably the first time you've heard that because he has to have that person on the earth he has to have it he even had me share somebody with that that they had a baby uh it was a little a little well i think they they thought it was why they weren't sure and god told me his name and called them and said uh he said he was struggling so he took him but he's going to send him back say he's god they came from him and he does what he needs to whether you miscarried or a baby was aborted um way back in the day when all that stuff kind of started most of the time the young people weren't involved in that it was pressure from the parents that you can't live your life with a baby hanging on whatever the babies the second i will tell you what their their guardian angel which is sent at conception will take them home to heaven and the second of course the little baby spirit leaves the baby body they're not experiencing pain or suffering or anything and they meet personally with jesus when they're taken up to heaven he's got a special place he meets all of these little babies and they actually receive him as their savior even in heaven they don't need to to stay there but they want to they want to and so their love from the moment they're there he has special places for them to play made just even for little babies this big i've seen an angel in the nursery holding five little babies it's going to be in my book three and then from different different ethnic groups and they were just playing in this angel's hand it was precious and he's made this play pond they ride on turtles they can swim under water breathe water they have picnics with jesus they get put in the pockets of the kangaroos and they hop them around take them for rides the nurseries are not don't look like a clinic they're huge nurseries it looks like beehives and the angels fly in and out they have flowers growing all around these beautiful little gorgeous like mother-of-pearl seashells with beautiful blankets in it and the baby's name is over it and the angels who work in these nurseries will hold these babies they sing the breath of god on them nourishes their little baby spirit and then they huh please name your baby that's most important because the angels give them a nickname when they arrive and that nickname is over have been to the nursery several times and uh when the parent decides to name the baby even if somebody wasn't married if the mother can pick a name for that baby pick one that could be either or you know like sydney could be a boy or a girl something like that pick a name because this is what happens the father sends for the baby i get i get over my own he'll send that little baby and he'll say i have a gift your parent just named you so no longer are you going to be called by your nickname this is your name and they have a big party in heaven for this little baby they actually have a cake for it and everything and they celebrate because their parents recognize they were there and that they would be given back people bring little gifts to that baby and and they change the name over the little thing when a grandparent a great grandparent gets home they get that baby they go get the baby they help to play with the baby raise the baby it grows so slowly it could be 50 years later and your baby would still be a baby god is beautiful and he loves his babies that's why he said it would be worse than having a millstone i wouldn't want to be any of the democrats right now it'd be better for a millstone you know how big they are about the size of that world maybe bigger that map a millstone that they would grind things with and it'd be better for you to have one tied around your neck and thrown into the sea than the punishment you will get for doing that i think he doesn't like it and i tell people but because god has a heart of love if you repent for that if you repent for doing that and give yourself to jesus from that moment your baby will be excited they know you got born again they know you're coming to heaven that's all they can talk about as they will be with their family again so yay jesus so i have to say like god would say every life matters no matter what the color of your skin is we came from the same god and he loves all of us and he has plans for all of us in heaven we're a family there's no baptist street you know people always want to put religion on something there's no pentecostal street there's no you know i can't think of the denominations there's no baptist assembly of god there's there's not your mansion is made for you by the way when you come home you come home as a son or daughter you're not coming home as i was their wife you know each other like best friends but you come home as the father's son or daughter so don't worry if you're married three times we're all in heaven you'll have three friends nobody owns anybody and the father did explain this to me i love him because he just opens up revelation to me to share with people there's a reason why you can't be still married when you go to heaven till death do you part because from that moment you're just his son or daughter you don't stop loving the people on the earth but jesus is our number one there's only one bridegroom in heaven and the father said this is why i had to say once you die you come home to heaven not married in heaven you are not married like on the earth on the earth the angels are not married either they're not that's probably a plus for them they're most of them now i know some of them actually wanted to have all spring that way that was a wildest thing to me why would they want to but in heaven the angels are pretty glad they don't have to get married because they watch us but god sends them on assignments i i need a tissue um he sends them on assignments with somebody who's the opposite personality if you've ever been around a comedian you are a very focused thank you once good enough if you're a focused serious person the last thing you want to be with is a comedian you're being sent on assignment right you're here to rescue this person from whatever whatever whatever stop the enemy's attacks on them and this the one angel i just want to wipe them all out let's just wipe them out get rid of them they're done they don't deserve anything and here's the comedian but won't it be fun uh maybe we'll make some new connections while we're down there maybe some make some new friends maybe go have some angel food together somewhere and this other one is tipped off now they don't sin but i mean he is annoyed because this one is rubbing him the wrong way which is the way he doesn't want to go like we do his husband and wife and this could be a long assignment and god's out there saying you just better get along and every now and then they'll send a courier down there you're being watched and notes are being made and you have to realize too these are real beings they have personalities they have assignments they like certain things they have comedians the two that help me write books one is that holy fierce one the other one's a comedian and they do steal rubbish all the fun silly things in the book where stuff the information was given to me by the fun angel the one about hellfire and all the other stuff was given god sent me two scribe angels they came from gabriel and i have my own angel he's 40 foot tall he's behind me last night make sure i don't fall over when you have the life of a seer it's different you see operations on both sides and you can share with people truth that can help them be free but if you're in the flesh you know what happens right to be spiritually minded is life to be fleshy minded is death that doesn't mean god doesn't love you it just means he can't use you a lot if you're always getting in the flesh which growing up all the body knew was to be in the flesh unless you had a move of god that he changed while the move was there moves of god in this time will actually begin to create a habitation that's god inhabiting your whole life so these are profound days serious days but exciting days for us he has really got your life in his hand if you belong to him but don't leave him out of everything make room for a christ in your life every day and i have conversations with him all the time the holy spirit is my teacher who tweaks me a lot and the father just loves me and gives me revelation i wish everybody could experience that it's like life in heaven it's like life in heaven it is it's just like that if you want to be with the father he'll make himself available in heaven to be with you he has this beautiful place he took me two one time i'm like eight years old and he'll say where would you like to go i can take you to the past i can take you to the future and i said i just want to be with you this was my answer from my own soul and he said well you know i can show you powerful things that happen the great days of the great revivals and you want to go see the welsh you want to go visit the welsh revival you want you want to go see this was created on the earth you want to go see time when it was made and i just want to be with you and the third time he said are you sure you don't want to go back and see when you were a little tiny thing in me you don't want to see when i cast lucifer out of heaven because he knows i'm fierce against the enemy i am right where i want to be and that's what he wanted to hear he said well that is what i wanted to hear you say and so then he put his arms around me he can be as big as he wants big enough that the world is a speck of dust in his hand or small enough to step inside himself and play with all the little spirits that's who he is so i've gotten to a place in my life whatever he wants or needs i'm doing it because nothing is worth missing blessing him i've learned the joy of obedience obedience isn't like a heart thing anymore it's a joy to obey because it blesses him when i love people when i share truth when i share revelation i didn't even really like the pink hair but i let them do it so i couldn't hide and these days a lot of people won't be able to hide anymore it'll be too apparent with the glory coming out of you or the fire on your head the fire on your homes people falling out when they pass in front of your house because of the life of god you have there it's because of him you're going to be different not normal not normal and america was designed by god to be a light in this world for his son to come and send two-thirds of the gospel around the world more people give to the gospel from this country than any other nation in the world more people are sent from here to any other nation to the world because of god that's his plan he calls america his gift his son is the greatest gift but he still says america is my gift to the world i'm not giving it to anyone else [Applause] so no matter what this is the thing you need to understand no matter what they say on election day if it's not what you expected just wait and see what happens i never go by what man says i go what god's plans are and he is taking america back amen he's taking it back and from america this world will begin to be changed and show other countries leaders this is the way you run your country justice liberty freedom and righteousness and he will have open doors to some of these leaders that didn't know they could do anything but war and the darkness would be being to be stripped away because of our authority we can't kill satan we can't kill demons but by our living our life and releasing the glory carrying it sharing the truth about the gospel of the kingdom and running after what god wants in our lives there's no way they can escape not knowing something's going on here and then we'll come to america to find jesus christ amen so we all have a commission and even those who don't want him he's gonna get some really stuff hot stuff going right there will be great harvest in this country and great harvest around the world but until he's ready it will not be the end okay so we focus on what we're doing right now what he wants right now and needs right now pray for all those people who've been feeding themselves with lies when trump wins it won't be good for them we'll rejoice and have a party but many people will think their life has ended because of the lies that were told to them and so we're going to break all that garbage let's just stand up and declare together something we'll pray for him right now i do know that eventually i'm not sure when but some of the networks will be taken from them they'll just be taken from them and given to those who will share the truth or who will be at least unbiased i mean the news is always i remember the day when you actually watched the news and it was real news and it's consumed on with hate because the enemy is running it right so he's going to get unseated so right now we all want to declare and pray on election day especially well we're going to thank god for everyone voting because you have to vote don't forget to vote right encourage people to vote uh but we're going to pray for all those on the luck today who have been filling themselves with lies that the enemy would not talk them into taking their life because god did tell me some people would take their life because they're so their layers are so consumed with all of that this is the only life we can have we will not have a life and they'll believe it so we're all going to take authority i'll just lead you into something to declare and then i'm going to release the glory into y'all are you ready for that jesus christ our lord and savior our beloved who saved our soul we honor your holy name we recognize your life that you gave for us we look forward this day and the future to ruin reign with you that is your desire so right now we corporately stand in the gap for those who've believed a lie and who hate without without measure we pray for their souls they will not be consumed with grief when trump wins on november the third we pray god the holy spirit will go to those voting booths and into the homes later to speak to the soul of those people to not take their life that there's still hope for them and we take power over all the power of the enemy has been controlling these lies and these people to bring deception we command the army of heaven to go right now and on election day do you make sweeps around this country depart on every stronghold of satan that is controlling them to shred every platform of high-level spheres of wickedness that would like to take their lives we say in the name of the lord we will not tolerate those actions we will not tolerate the enemy ruining people's destinies we say no more will you control this country or run this country or steal people's destinies this is a time of celebration and greatness and we declare those people who believe the lie will not miss their destiny they will become believers in jesus christ and great witnesses to his salvation so be it in jesus name [Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] oh sit down for just a minute [Music] there's many ways we can do do this importations and there's one of the ways i do it quite often when we have a quite a bit of people i have everybody hold hands it's going to be okay you won't get sick we evict any of that we won't tolerate any sickness in this no we don't tolerate the virus anymore either right we kick it out and evict it from this place only each row not all the way across okay only like this row hold hands just this row i'm gonna come by i'm gonna come by and i'm gonna grab the hand of the person and literally it will flow through every person [Music] i want you to picture i want you to picture this really happens i've done a congregation with 3 000 people like this and you're already sitting so if you have to fall at least it's backwards the glory is the power and presence of the living god it comes in a form of a cloud like light the glory is always talked about as the light or a cloud remember the cloud by day the fire by night they both belong to him they do different things inside of us baptism and fire will burn the whole world off the walls of your soul like it was never there things you things you saw things that bothered you that's what the fire does i've had a measure it came in and hit me so hard when the pastor ladies and i was thrown back into the congregation with a usher a seven foot usher thrown and my body laid on the floor and it shook that's fire okay and and the first time ever angels came and took me back in time my body was there they locked me in with a security guard stuck a note in my sleeve when she wakes up my dad will come and get her call this number i was taken back to the tomb of christ right after the stone had been rolled away i was there at that time if he takes you the time you're there it's not a vision it's not a dream and i have a lot of revelation about his resurrection what that looked like what went on it was really powerful and then he brought me back and all i could do was speak in tongues for two weeks and i had open visions of the fire hitting cities whole cities and congregations is something you don't have to ask people did you get baptism and fire the glory is something that builds in you the more you know him spend time with him obey him this glory he let you carry it for him and let me tell you people will be seeking that out it can sometimes be visibly seen on moses the glory was seen on his face remember that because he was what with god when you spend time with him that glory begins to build in you and it even says at one point the night will be light around us in other words it won't come upon you if you go outside you are the light walking around like people can't escape that what is that light on you what is that you get to share all about jesus and the glory right and then when you get into loose and waves it begins to it will totally wipe out anything of the darkness around people in buildings and that that glory cloud it's a cloud i saw a sole cloud last night just ruling around me the whole time and uh and sometimes you can hear it it's like a shock wave you can hear it and i'm like the first time it happened i'm like wow that person is really anointed i was walking past at the product's table and the holy spirit was just laughing he said go just start walking along the line and where they went they went and i said well this were those people anointed he goes that was coming from you will let you experience releasing the glory and when you take it around the world that's what happens to cities this is for the body of christ so you're going to get a measure of that glory we do it by laying on our hands if i feel like it's not enough i'm just going to mind touch it i might run over top of the rose i don't know what i'll do a greater work is walking on air i've done that you feel nothing but you're walking on it christ walked on water he felt the water walking on years of greater work that awesome this is for us this is who we are it's because of who we belong to who we give ourselves to we have not just promises but we have rights as believers to walk in all of that so i'm just going to start somewhere over here and i will just grab the hand and i'll feel it leaving me i'll feel that leaving me and it just goes down the row i'll go to the next one and you just need to say i'll receive it okay so get ready the ones on the end you're going to be last there's something about being last so y'all ready so we'll go down this road so father right now i just release

name amen thank you thank you lord um i don't know about you but i really like hearing about heaven yeah it wasn't wasn't that wasn't it's always uh isn't it always wonderful to hear about the babies and the children some of you have lost children in their young and some of you have lost babies and and although just isn't it heaven every time she shares that story and she even she enhanced it all the things uh just just really powerful i trust it touch your heart for some of you that have been really burdened over those children um the babies the children that um have been abused so the lord's lord's taken care of taking care of his children um thank you lord this is uh this is a very um it's a very powerful time we always love it when cat comes i was talking to pastor brooke last night and he says you know we got to have her come here twice a year at least you guys okay with that if she could come very good very good she could come yeah jen come on you got some oh mama come here for a second come on come on mama come here and we want to make sure you yeah come on come on up here we'll make sure we we'll make sure that we get jen you come on up look at these shoes man oh look at them babies camera camera yeah look at those hey that's awesome hey um is there anything you want to say mama yeah we we are just always so blessed to have you here dear and anything you want to tell on cat or you know when she's a kid you know you know we knew she was perfect but anything else you want to you want to say um yes first i want to tell you you've been my church for a whole year now faithfully and i can't wait for sunday to come i just didn't know you were on more than sunday or i've been watching them but i've seen so many of you on the camera and i thought these people are my family and so but but i want to speak now too just for just a few minutes i'll try to make it quick because i'm not i'm really not you're doing good so far i'm not get up here but from the time i was a little girl all i ever wanted to be was a wife little mother and i didn't know the lord in my heart but i talked to him and i told him all i want to be is a mother and a wife and that's all i ever wanted to be so when i got married well i went to church with my grandmother i was raised catholic but i went to church from my grandmother to her old-time methodist church and i got to hear hymns in english so the one that stuck with me was in the garden and i don't know whether any of you even know that old but i i was little and i sat there and i heard them sing he walks with me and he talks with me and i never said anything to my grandma but i thought can you really do that and amazingly even though i went to a catholic school and always went to church in the confession none of it stuck with me not one bit of it it just didn't stick so when i met my husband who was a spirit-filled pentecostal [Music] and i just saw something in him that i knew i had never felt before and an assembly god pastor married us and i wasn't saved but i did he talked with me and i told him my children will be raised in church my husband's church and i will go with him so he went ahead and married us but as i in the first year i had my first baby she was two months early she only weighed four pounds a little bitty thing and i started praying over my babies i prayed over them while i carried them and i talked to the lord and i said all i ever want lord for my children is that they serve you with their whole hearts and i don't care where you call them to go out back the prayer and as they little older when they grow up i gave them back to the lord i said their daddy and i have raised them to know you now they're your your job where you want to send them and i've never held back on one of them and where they want to go so don't ever ever give up on their children if you haven't had children yet start praying for them before you even get them and don't ever back down because i've gone through things with some of my kids and i just always said lord they're yours they're yours they're yours they're yours sometimes you have to give tough love don't back down from that either it may hurt but in the long run you those that you love you chastise that's right it's good so i want to know you to know how much i love all of you and your your praise and everything else you just bless me thank you lord hey mama i want you to do one thing if you have uh and even if you're at home and you have kids that are wayward and uh and they're not serving the lord i want you to stand up we're gonna have mama we'll have mama pray for them and then if you're home well you can buy any of the medias just stand up right there in your home get out of that lazy boy just stand up there very good okay mama pray for him father i'm going to tell them like you told me when i had my wiggler son wandering in the wilderness and you said don't worry i haven't been on my hand and when the time is ripe i'm just going to close that hand and he'll be back where he belongs so don't worry that's one thing that can hinder your prayers that's good don't worry you don't you don't worry if you trust the lord you trust him with your whole heart and no matter how bad it looks you just remind him lord i love you first i love them second but i know you love them more so i'm just trusting you to bring them around very good so be it that's good yeah they're yours lord they're yours lord you do whatever you want they just you just came on loan to me thank you mama thank you that was really awesome thank you lord

how important it is for us to be here right now and to have revelation to live by i know we live in this world but we are not of this world we are hovanians first how many people believe life in heaven is better than anywhere else [Music] and everyone who lives there thinks so and i know people picture you know a handful in heaven and a multitude in hell but you're wrong there's millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of people who live in heaven that really got jesus some of it was on their deathbed but they got him some of them you'd be surprised who made it when you get there sometimes i was surprised [Laughter] but i'm here to uh god calls me a revelator if you wonder where that started it wasn't from me most of the things i share are not from me i have to say them because he asked me to say them but i'm a revelator i reveal things and john in the book of john in revelation he also was a revelator and i've had people say the craziest things to me well why do you say that that's not anywhere in the bible there's nothing about revelation in the bible apparently you have not read the last chapter that's not a title or something that's actually something that happened it is a thing it's revelation from the father not from man and if it was important enough to put in the word of god then it's important enough to still share it today and i know i get a lot of revelation i got new stuff today i got brand new stuff today just sitting in the hotel room and jen said one thing to me and a portal open and revelation on what she asked me pour down from heaven um that's not the first time it happened but not not as much as i got it didn't stop it was still going and i finally had to uh stop and go out the hallway of where we were eating in the hotel and just record what he had told me so fonda was so much and one of the things he did talk to me about today was kavanaugh yeah he talked to me about kavanaugh and the supreme court and justice for america and so i will be talking about this wearing my my red word white and blue here and even my boots see they're red white and blue you have me get those i i got these from jones boot company in missouri yes i think they're the second or third largest in america and i know by mentioning their name to give a lot of money to the gospel and i think it's third generation now a very good friend of ours um and a friend of mine daughter and her husband my son-in-law they're very close friends and he recently took over he's young he really recently took over the hogue company they started as a yarn distributor not yarn but twine uh and the holes were said no they didn't sell yarn to bail the hay with i don't know a lot about bailing hay but i know you need more than yarn to tie it all together and they started you know doing that and they're known all over the world really they sell that but then they went into the boot industry and when i do go they sell to me like one-third the price so i have a lot of boots and every time i go there to minister they get me more boots but i wasn't there this last time uh god said why don't you get those with the red white and blue on we like those and i've worn them a lot especially if we're going to talk about america uh heaven wants me to wear red white and blue and i think today they're all wearing red white and blue in heaven if you if you think they're disconnected from the things going on this earth you don't know them they're very much involved in what we are doing because they're all declaring over the destinies of all of us who are here right now those who finished the race and they moved to heaven by the way they didn't get lost you don't need to tell people i lost my father i lost them no they moved that's right you know my father moved to heaven that's the greatest place you couldn't even find it on this earth having more fun than they ever had in their life they're existing to live yeah you know down here a lot of times we feel like we live just to exist okay people some don't understand that i do not believe that you your whole body sleeps when it dies your soul never sleeps not now and your spirit man never sleeps either there's both spiritual things they're wait 24 hours a day and let me tell you they'd be bored in a casket if you went right now and laid in the casket and shot that lid that's what it would be like if all of you stayed there but that's not what happens it's not what the bible says it says to be absent from the body that means something moved out of there right yes it moved out because this is just like a covering this is just a little thing that you know holds all the stuff together inside and uh and right now it's temporary because when you get it back one day it will be glorified it will be supernaturally glorified one day and everyone who lives in heaven knows that's going to happen to them one day and it's going to be fantastic but we have a mission and a commission right now on this earth to do things never done before we are a supernatural people a supernatural generation living on this earth that was made by the god that we love and that we serve and they're all excited up there about this country now i will assure you he loves the world the world and the fullness thereof belongs to the lord it does and he is also very interested in what's going on he still comes down here a lot he appears to a lot of people get messages to people he actually does it to me a lot also so it's not like he moved up there and just stayed there forever he does go back and forth a lot he does come in himself and say things to people he's appearing to the jihad so how about that's that's that that is the the i guess the most i don't know how to speak to introduce them to you but they're not normal muslims i'll just tell you that uh the jihad many of them are interested in wiping out a lot of stuff on the earth they don't know god they don't know jesus christ but he is in person coming to them and there are a lot of them getting saved it's part of shifting nations right now and so nothing is going to seem to be impossible and even what happened in the supreme court a lot of people would say that was never going to happen i knew it was going to happen because i do know god's plans for this country and i'm telling you it's going to be fantastic to live here and at the end of 24 years it will not even look like or sound like like the same country it will be beyond better than it was [Applause] everywhere in this nation in the most unexpected places and i'm telling you he's coming to consume us in this nation he's going to make an example for other nations to follow if they want god amen that's the pattern if they want god and they want success they want employment for their people if they want their people to be free to be safe to be prosperous then god's going to make our country an example of that because of him amen and so we've been very much involved in the last elections and i'm excited about november i'm excited about the midterm elections it's going to be just like it was before it's going to turn the map red and i know uh if you watch the fake news and let me tell you this people if they were smarter they wouldn't be beating everyone up and accusing them wrongly you know they they don't even know what they're doing in today's society with the internet with twitter you know with the podcast however we are we're available everywhere 24 hours a day you can talk to people you know on this online everything everybody posted but you can't hide it anymore and that's really a good thing because god can't be hidden anymore and the righteous things can't be hidden and justice and freedom cannot be hidden what's being done right can no longer be hidden by the other side that doesn't want anything good really i'm sorry for them sometimes that they they can't see what they're doing or saying they're hurting their self and they and what their plan is would hurt generations even more than what we have been affected already and so that's why god put someone in the white house who knew what to do in the situation who wouldn't back down wouldn't be bought you know couldn't be used couldn't could not you can't put fear in him and i tell people tonight don't waste your time anymore you're not going to impeach him not ever he will be there for eight years whether anybody likes it or not well heaven likes it and i remember when god said from the time he takes the the seat in the white house america will not have one boring day and we haven't have it and you know god did anoint him to influence because the influence he has is for good yes it is for good he gives a space for god whether you know it or not he does know him he's still new in that but he does he as we see jesus christ as the savior i'm talking about our president and he's very focused on not letting god be shut out of our country and that alone is just that the blessings that come upon our country just because he recognizes there is a god and this country belongs to god and i don't know how many times he's already said god bless america god bless the people and i still think one of the most famous things he said and his acceptance speak to us i'm here to give your country back to you and i don't remember any other president ever saying i'm here to give your country back to you because you know i don't think a lot of people remember it's for the people by the people yes is that right yeah and so we do have a lot of say i've never in my life gotten so many texts and surveys never in my life from you know you think this solicitor at your door you know or all these other people calling you on the phone to take uh you know asking to do surveys uh our president has asked me for more than any other company i know in america has a has sent me a surveys on my phone all the time and emailed it to me and texted it to me and if you're giving me your number you're going to get text i'll tell you that about everything and so he definitely is what god said he was that he's an all-american boy who was all for america and i won't ever stop talking about it because god won't let me stop talking about him he said my voice is going to be heard of what i think what i plan and what is actually going to happen yes and don't listen to what anyone else says because i have the final word that's my that's my my boy this that i put in the white house and he said i made him a certain way and he was out of all of the people in the land right now anywhere in this country he was my choice amen he said i will back it up and the people will love him even though some may not like that they'll still benefit from it and there's already been like two million jobs created amen and our borders are safer they're going to get safer and i can tell you that part of the other side wants no borders whatsoever that's not wise everybody say that's not wise i don't want that do you want that no i don't either because it it protects us right right we're not a mean hateful special country you can come in legally yeah we don't say you can't come you come illegally so we know who is criminals and who are not criminals who are terrorists who are not terrorists because there wouldn't be much of a country left amen so we have some really good solid plans uh that would be god and and our government right now has some really good solid plans for this country and i'm really excited about it uh the prosperity the joy the celebration uh the holidays being brought back i will be celebrating christmas in a big way we make a birthday cake for jesus we've always done that when i was growing up we had a birthday cake for jesus he likes some honey in it by the way but he does love sweets and if you have a sweet tooth blanket on him or joint heirs with christ remember that who would have ever thought one thing i have found out in my many encounters that i have in heaven with god i mean before it was always jesus who would walk through the walls of my home and he'd have me sit down and he would say things to me like face to face like i'm looking at you and uh i had not ever got accustomed to that and still get undone but when the father comes you know uh they have the same heart they have that same holiness in them but when the father comes himself it does something to the inside of me that my dad my my permanently always daddy where i lived and who who took care of me and held me and it says in the bible that he was called you know he's called the mini-breasted when i'm talking about the father he carried us inside of him like a mother carries the babies in the womb and i love the little things he would tell me that he would tell to a little child anywhere he said you know i put water in the womb of the mother so it'd be something that would be familiar to that baby because when you lived in me you played in the river of life inside of me i never thought of that not ever in a million years would i have ever and yeah i knew that i mean i knew that there was water it protects the baby it keeps the float you know there's all reasons why we have and i have birth three children so i understand all that and uh but i never considered the fact even knowing the river of life was inside the father and it flows out of him it's never ending you can't see where it comes from at all but it's it's never ending and we would play inside we would swim we'd swim under the water run on top of the water jump on the stones of fire he has this massive mountain the highest line i've ever seen was inside him and we would run and slide down that mountain from the water flowing in it then we would jump on the stones of fire and we played we played like little children we played we didn't have to decide what we were going to eat where we were going to live you know what we were going to do and then we could move out we would jump on the rays of the rainbow to come from inside them they would jump on and we would ride in and out on those rays of the rainbow because in him we lived we moved we had our very existence and so and that's what that talks about in the scripture we came from him everybody came from the same place we all all people whoever were born on this earth lived in him first it said in the bible he knew us before we were born you know he would talk to us he would play with us because we lived in him that's how he could see us that's how he could know us he wrote every day of our life in the book before he sent us how about that and there's other scrolls in heaven that talk about the plans he has for you and sometimes you'll be partnering with the host of heaven or maybe with gabriel's group and helping to bring the body parts down a gabriel's group bring those body parts down a lot of people have prayed them down you know and and really that's necessary for us to do that we have to invite heaven that's why we invite jesus christ yes you need to get jesus without asking him to come in is that true this is some of the most powerful revelation i was ever given when i was in heaven when he caught me up to heaven he said there is a protocol you must invite you have to invite my son for him to come live in you you're going to invite the holy spirit to come and indwell you and he says so when you invite that gives us permission to do something with that invitation you have to invite the host of heaven to be one of your personal weapons that will war against the enemy and pull down the strongholds around you put on strongholds of darkness and uh so there's new revelation that plan of god that we will actually help complete the destiny of the armies of heaven he's already always had that plan while we lived in him we weren't even here the earth wasn't even here he made plans for that because see the the armies of heaven can't just go attack wherever they want to they're an army our army well unless trump's over yeah anyway most armies just can't go attack what they feel like well this is basically we're going to take our own weapons without any orders from headquarters we're just going to go attack wherever we want to that would not make sense down here are the military no matter what military or what country they all pretty much have the same way they handle that they have officers over them but first they train them is that right they get trained and i tell people all the time this is a good way to explain it to you you want to be an airline pilot you go apply with delta or american airlines you're not going to walk in the next day and get your license i wouldn't fly on that plane our lives as believers it's the same thing but the angels in heaven it is the same way they have a protocol of how they operate in heaven the government of heaven the army of heaven and gabriel's all the watcher angels and the healing angels and the body parts angels worker angels scribes i can i can make a whole long list that are under gabriel one of the guardian one of the um my mind's going now uh one of the archangels thank you holy spirit um the archangels are fantastic they have a higher level of understanding of knowledge inside of them because they're over like whole groups of angels and the hosts actually prefer to be called the host when it says a great host in the bible that's the army okay it talks about angels and leaders of angels that's usually gabriel's group and gabriel's work look beautiful most all of gabriel's the angels under him look like us you probably couldn't tell sometimes if it was an angel or not they can hide their wings many times i have i don't have arguments but people try to argue with me that angels don't have wings because i've seen them and they don't have any and so you didn't see all of them okay you didn't see all of the all almost every angel i've ever known or seen which is probably billions of angels at this point they all have wings some are made out of energy some are made out of color some are made of light you know we always think they have to have feathers you know like a bird and if they don't have them they don't have them but they're probably invisible some can have them when they need them and not have them i have news for you the father has wings so there's jesus he came with healing in his he does he doesn't always show them he does have wings mighty wings the father has powerful mighty wings you know about psalms 91 right he has wings holy spirit has wings the holy spirit is huge he's really tall i have never seen him he's invisible but he does have an appearance it's the best way to describe him i used to ask god how do i describe him he lives in me i hope he lives in you holy spirit lives in me he's my best friend yes and i thank him all the time the most simplest things i need or i can't find or i don't know he'll show me bring it to me or tell me without me even asking and so he talks to me 24 hours a day gets on to me a lot that's what best friends do right yes and he's also god i don't know why people want to put him in a different category he's god he can be worshipped he can be praised and so he's part of the trinity they're all holy they're all the godhead and they are uh even though their parents may differ a little bit their heart is the same they are for us they are not against us they have more hope for us than anyone else in existence and so uh they're fantastic to to get to know i want everyone here to know them you know in a in a really awesome way and but their goal always is for us to be greater to be more prosperous to have their heart to have their understanding to know their ways to want their will it's really important to have those things if you're going to be successful in this world and when you get to that place the devil will be terrified of you he's already afraid of you he doesn't attack you because he's angry he attacks because he is very afraid he's afraid you'll become you will become more and more like them amen he really is he doesn't want you to have revelation he doesn't want you to know how to be greater he doesn't want you the devil doesn't want you to know how to go in the spirit realm and or execute the government of god on this earth or how your soul to prosper especially he's most terrified that he does not want your soul to prosper he doesn't want you to live in divine help he doesn't but that's just too bad because in this time it'll be normal to operate just like that that your soul will continue to prosper every day that it will not be filled with doom and gloom with violence with anger with offense all those things come from the enemy and the less you have them the more terrified hell is of you and the more blessed god is in heaven so in my life i love to bless the lord i love to bless the father and i love to bless the holy spirit i greet them every morning when i wake up that's the first thing i say and then i kiss my husband goodbye so he can go fishing and he goes fishing and spends time with god that's how he spends his time with him i mean if it's 14 15 hours and smell like bait when he comes home not my favorite thing but really you can have as much of them as you want as much as you will choose to pursue them and we get so busy in this world just trying to live sometimes we forget them unless we really need something and it's okay to ask for help and you need help but the whole purpose for us to have the host of heaven the armies of heaven at our personal disposal to use is so you won't be running to them all the time asking them to rescue you to keep you safe because we have that ability because of christ to do that ourself because we're going to a new level we can't live the same place we were before you can't we go from glory to glory that means you're going to a higher level of knowing them a higher level of dominion and authority a higher level of prosperity a higher level of the glory that is an upward movement that means you can't stay here we can't be down here anymore being crushed by the enemy he is under our feet [Applause] i'm gonna make doormats and say hell is our doormat that's the way we need to think if we always walk around filled with fear or confusion or anger then we can't go to those levels so that's why god is sending some of the greatest revelation this is my introduction i'm going to talk about america but this is the holy spirit's introduction i'll just say that the holy spirit always has an introduction because there's always new people who how many people this first time you've ever heard me anybody bless them jesus just take your natural mind and set it on a shelf you'll be fine because i talk about spiritual things now i walk in the spirit amen so i don't walk in the flesh i don't have personal opinions i have their revelation and i live by it i can't tell you these things if i have not lived them myself and it does make a difference but what i'm sharing to you is a lifestyle it's not a cafeteria if you can live on earth like they do in heaven that means you'll have to make some changes in your life you walk in the spirit what does that mean that's a place it's a place by the way new revelation john was in the spirit why did he say that why did that why didn't even get put in the bible why was that in the bible they could have just said he heard and was caught up that's not how it starts he was in the spirit it was the way he lived how he processed god the way he responded to everything he lived a spiritual life that doesn't mean you walk around so you know so serious and sour and that's not even what holy is holy is absent of sin it's an absence of sin that's not hard amen so john lived this way that he would hear the voice of the lord he always obeyed he was always willing to do what he wanted and he kept him on this earth he could still be here if he wanted to but he missed heaven remember he went there you never forget it when he was caught up so he was in that that place in his heart he was in the spirit on the lord's day and when they because they said that i don't think he was even on the isle of patmos that was supposed to be his prison they put him there because they were so afraid of him they couldn't kill him they tried more than three times they tried to kill him all the time it never worked it never worked because this was what god was doing with him he was allowing him to stay here as long as he wanted he would fill him with things all the time so he was already sharing and doing what god had told him and i'm sure what jesus taught him he would go in the spirit in the spirit realm and he would appear before the sanhedrin when he felt like it even after he was sent to the alabamas they didn't want him to talk to people they didn't want him around people he was way too weird they couldn't kill this guy you know what are we going to do we need to put him somewhere so we're safe he couldn't make you know any interruption or disruption which happened every time he would appear somewhere he already had that revelation of going in the spirit and so he was in the spirit on the lord's day and that door open he heard that voice he recognized that voice and then he was taken up and saw heaven saw god the father sitting on the throne with the rainbow around him he saw him [Laughter] and so he was showing him he saw the very person that he would say in the book of john you cannot see the face of god and live and yet in the book of revelation he saw him and saw the face of god and lived because this was about a new relationship when you receive jesus christ you can see the face of god and live you can see it you're not going to be any different when you go to heaven if you have christ in you then you're righteous you have entrance into heaven not just when you die sometimes god will catch people up even even unsaved people just so they can have an encounter and they freak out they come back and then they want to receive jesus christ that's happening a lot too he's not just catching up believers and so you can have an encounter with the living god with jesus christ the holy spirit a lot of us have already had he's definitely strange he loves drama in case you wonder why we have drama when we receive the holy spirit there's a lot of drama i love a story that was told a long time ago i think it was probably back in the 50s 40s and this church was experiencing the holy spirit just moving on everybody but their pianist was the most proper person in the church and she wore white every sunday to show how holy she was and she sit there and play the most common alcohol tunes on her organ and she was never moved or touched and everybody was like falling out there rolling on the floor they were speaking in tongues you know and she thinks i'm just going to remain rapper until one sunday church was passed they all wanted to come and see what was going on and the holy spirit just totally invaded her she jumped off of the off of the bench and did flips she hit the pipe of the wood stove sit like a cloud came over her it covered her white outfit all the way to her feet stuck in her hair it got on her face she went up and down the aisle just yelling in tongues back and forth did not care at all so there was drama in that church that day that's right this is a true story and she never was the same after that she loved everybody she's saying she's singing tongues sometimes you know and so let me tell you you can try to avoid it all you want to but they're going to come a day when the spirit of god would touch all flesh amen without permission in the last days i will pour out my spirit on what and people who never prophesied before never had visions before never dreamed they're going to do it that's right it could be people walking out of walmart get hit by the holy spirit this is the picture you need to have not just everybody sitting in a church and happening it's going to happen in the streets in the restaurants in the grocery store you know the holy spirit's not going to go oh i should wait until they come out now he's the most excited being in all existence right now the greatest show on earth will be when the spirit of god is loose on all [Applause] and people who know flesh a believer they'll all be beating your door down calling you on the phone what just happened to me what happened what happened what happened i can't stop shaking i'm crying i'm laughing i need to know who jesus is i know you know him yes it's going to happen it hasn't happened yet the baptism in fire is going to come right after that that is a separate baptism yes it's the fire that comes from god the father himself it will not be very long away i don't have dates for everything but i can tell you this just because of what's already happening in the world and there's signs that you will see signs that things are changing and it's not going to be the same well the very trump got elected was a sign okay something new is happening god's actually going to do exactly what he wants no matter what the whole world is saying no matter what comes up against him it's just not going to make any difference because you're fighting god and all those democrats were fighting god about kavanaugh because god was on his side he wants change in the justice department so god has a lot of things that that are just starting on the earth for the first time yeah and we get to do that yes he's not just going to do everything himself he wants you to do them now you probably thought your whole life you're going to sit on a seat and go home and have a good sunday dinner and watch football or you know go play with your kids or whatever you do and then i'll go back next sunday your life won't be like that anymore you won't it'll be a lot more exciting it'll be powerful there'll be many things required of you and in order for you to carry the glory the absolute power of the living god yes to when you walk into places things are shifted like hundreds and thousands of people like land where nothing grew before produce will come up you go out and stop the earthquakes and then they can put it back you raise the dead that will cremate it yes these are greater works see all these are things that are mentioned in the bible but i think some pastors forget them because a lot of them are just talking about escaping and that's not what's going to happen that's why the holy spirit told me to make things that said roll up your rapture rug remember the first time you said okay you're going to the church are you going to say tell everybody roll up the raptor rugged one okay roll up your rapture rug he said i didn't tell you to occupy that that's not money man jesus said occupy until i come that doesn't mean go sit somewhere in the woods with the raccoons and the sea rations and it doesn't mean sitting under wraps or rugging your corn or not doing ever doing anything but waiting to get out of this awful place he expects us to change it with the power of god revelation us surrendering our life you know when you get saved when you get born again the light of god is put in you your name is written in this massive book in heaven the book of life the angels always record it when people get born again they're always recording it as evidence they take it to heaven they don't have to but they want to god takes a stone of fire from himself and puts it in your spirit man and that's when you have light that's where the light comes from jesus takes a portion of his anointing a measure of the anointing walking on the earth and he deposits it in you that's in first down 227 if you wonder where that is so you get something you get deposits and things put in you to make you supernatural and then it gives you revelation especially when there's a new time we have new ways we have understanding of our weapons if we have been using them that armor of god he told you to put on it is powerful if you're going into a strange place where you know people use like really bad language or stuff going on before you go in that door you need to lift up my shield of faith it will block and quench every fiery dart of the enemy those are words propane words like people screaming yelling hating it won't penetrate you that's what that shield does all of those parts of your armor are important but when you have revelation they're even more powerful and now he's adding on top of that the the destiny of the army of heaven to operate as our weapon and we command them because god himself said command he me he didn't say tell me what to do what he was saying was you say what is going to happen if we are kings and priests we have authority we have a voice to speak we have a voice to speak into the atmosphere into the spirit realm against any evil no matter where it is we have power over all the power of the enemy he gave us powerful weapons his word is powerful his name the demons hate his name they remember who he was and he wasted hell on the third day and noted the faces of the principalities and powers and they can't change it they can't fix themselves when something happens from a born-again powerful believer filled with jesus christ you are dangerous that and i know you i talk a lot about the authority because the body needs to know they have it yes and i could talk about all the love of god and i did that for years how much you love them he believes your father you know he wants he wants you to know his mercy and his goodness and he does he wants you to be blessed beyond measure and he does but he wants to know the other part of it jesus is a warrior he's a king right now i don't picture him as a little a shepherd holding a little lamb in his arms anymore i see him with those crowns on his head and his flings of fire and that sword that comes unless you divide things asunder i see him that way he is my king he is the king of spiritual kings we are the spiritual kings [Music] so this is a new lifestyle for you what i share with you is not just one little thing that's going to help you or another little thing if you live without revelation it's a lifestyle i mean the host of heaven hearken unto the voice of the lord and he's in us when we speak and give them commands to go do things put on strongholds of darkness crush it push it back they do it because they recognize that voice in us but if you as a believer are playing in sin you may as well put an ego target on you you're going to get tapped that's right you can't go forward in the kingdom that's right and then you step back by playing or partnering with help you're stepping back you see that you're stepping back and you're flashing into the way you were before and you're partnering with the enemy well that means man they were beating me up now i'm coming after them yes that's right someone actually asked a question at our table why do i get attacked a lot i feel like they got a big target on me well i i didn't answer that question but my first thing was how have you been living have you been treating people what have you been saying what's in your layers good because you have to be filled with the light like we we are the kingdom of light we are against the kingdom of darkness so if you get sucked into that kingdom of darkness that means you stepped back and you are not fit for the kingdom is that what that scripture says if you go forward in the kingdom don't step back or you will not be fit for the kingdom it's like an athlete who's practicing for the olympics for like 10 years they've been doing they finally get their time three months away and they decide i'm just going to stop all this i'm tired of practicing i don't want to practice i don't want to do this i'm tired i'm taking a break do you think they would win in the olympics they wouldn't be any use to themselves or their team they would not be fit to compete that's what he means when he says you will not be fit for the kingdom because your level of authority went down when you gave it away to the enemy that's that's not god doing that that's your choice with your will amen so don't step back if you go forward with this you got to keep going forward heaven is a forward motion it's not a back and forth i'm going here and i'm going to go back and i'm going here oh no i got to go back and he'll forgive you for all of it to forgive you always but he can't put you back up here if you were there and you step back either by going into sin or by hating people and bashing and crushing them all the time that's not heaven's words you're not giving life it says choose life or death you're giving death so that means you're stepping back then the place you were in going forward in the light you're making conquest sending the host to put on strongholds mess up the isis they get messed up you can't go forward and and the host will listen to you as long as you're going forward in the light and there's not darkness in you because they can't partner with darkness they were sent by the lord they are a weapon a mighty weapon to the pulling down of strongholds we don't fight the enemy we're already conquerors that as kings and priests and the kingdom we do have an army amen it's the nose no difference in our own military if we had great generals and they were getting all these troops to go forward making conquest taking land taking territory and they decided to go partner with the very enemy they're fighting and they give out secret information and tell for well some of our troops are stuff like that do you think they are going to be any good to this military that they've been taking forward we have to see it that way that we can no longer participate with the enemy and do not let fear rule you that's right that's right one of the reasons why our president is so successful is he does not have fear in him he doesn't have fear he's made major plans everything within his being wants to see those plans happen he really loves his country and he really loves the people and just because people have twisted and lied about but he doesn't care what they're saying he's not wasting his time he's not running back trying to pull out stuff no no no no he is going forward which terrifies the enemy and we should have an example we have jesus christ for example but our very president should be an example to all of us if you want to achieve the destiny and the goal you have in your life you can't let everybody here or here pull you back drag you off the path get you caught into other things you have to stay focused amen and have fun while you're doing it that's right man so today the victory that happened in our country and this is what that victory meant all of heaven is celebrating kavanaugh being put on the supreme court this is why they're celebrating and i'm sitting there god says pouring this all stuff into me and i watched it when they confirmed him and i kept telling people i don't care what they're saying i don't have time to listen to the other side i don't i know that god has positioned this country for greatness for blessings for justice which is written on one of the steps of his very throne the word justice is there this is our season and time for justice especially as believers but also for our country this is a time of justice liberty and freedom and that's what he stood for that's what kavanaugh stood for and so they found someone to pay them to lie with not one shred of evidence no evidence even his own children did not believe the lies about him they lived with him they knew his character they knew that he loved god and god picked him like he put trump and he kept telling me i don't care what they say he is sitting on the supreme court he's going to wipe out rogue versus way he's going to give life to baby and when i'm sitting there today in the hotel room he kept showing me letting me see all these millions of babies who have been aborted and have hearings that are in heaven they sang and celebrated as they were saying yes he was going to sit on the screen this is what they knew that life would change for all the babies in america that no longer illegal to take their lives and wipe them away like dust like they had that and they have forgiven all those people there's no anger in their little souls they're free they forgive everybody the people who performed it the people who allowed it the people who voted for that to be legal they forgave every person but today they had a party in heaven and they celebrated the other babies being conceived in the womb one day we'll never have to fear the life being taken and they'll get to complete their destiny on this earth so there was a big party in heaven today because of that and then and the father began to tell me he said yes we now have there is now god in the white house because he's welcomed and allowed to be there and he said and now i have permission to be in the supreme court because of cavanaugh as a believer being sit on that vent sitting on the bench of the supreme court he said now i have the right to speak into the court system and he said because of that i have assigned three special ops angels see i'll never just tell you something you're going to get details he has a sign of three powerful angels host of the host and they're called their names are justice liberty and freedom and they are assigned to protect and keep kavanaugh on his family and they're also assigned to help him bring justice liberty and freedom to this country in the supreme court and he said he was just the first put in there he said there are more to follow and everyone that's nominated will win the nomination he said because i'm involved in that amen so this is really a time for us to celebrate god's hand moving again divinely moving against all the stuff that was manufactured paid to happen and as much as possible they would spend all their time on the fake news telling the fake stuff and it didn't stop it it didn't stop it from happening god said and again in the midterm elections that map will be turned red amen okay because i did not invest myself in trump and putting him in the office only to have halfway through his term have everything taken away he said that it will not happen so there's some prophecy for you going to be great you just have to watch stop watching jumps and a lot of people do not understand they think the whole end is here we actually had somebody i don't know if they message me or commented i don't know what they did um what the hell they said it to me they said that you are absolutely wrong you need to stop talking about all these good things happening because this is the last day and there is no time for those things to happen i want to say maybe not on your clock or calendar but we're living on god's timeline right now amen and i said i will not ever stop saying these things because they will happen yes amen god's going to make sure his voice stays spoken in this world so you know what's going to happen amen you should hear him that clearly if your heart is to pursue him to have that you're going to have it you can't escape having his voice you can't he's not a respecter of persons we all have the ability to prophesy the bible say all they prophesied does that say that yes so he said desire the best gifts that's a best gift you hear how god's voice and then speak it for him and let me tell you go how do i know he's saying something you feel like you're going to explode inside yeah it really does happen that way when i first started doing that it would like begin to burn and then it felt like my whole body was going to explode and the longer i waited to say something and the whole time the holy spirit is saying open your mouth open your mouth i don't know what to say open your mouth you gotta open your mouth step up and open your mouth there were no real lessons about that but i just honestly say open your mouth and say it to whoever it's for and make sure it's supposed to be spoken sometimes god shares things with you so you can pray right so you have to discern is this something that i can say in love that will help them change or am i wanting to do this because my flesh is really happy i can bash them god doesn't bash he shares he gives correction and then direction but he does it in love man so what i have is good news i have good news for us good news for america and not only that the countries he's shifting around this world like korea and that will be one land it will be one country without communism or a war people are thinking that's just not going to happen without a war i went yes it is it will happen because this is god's plan and if he can shift the mind and the focus of that north america north korean president then it will happen and while i was in korea i was there to do eight meetings in 10 days i lost like 15 pounds yesterday seafood yes the brazil nuts were really good the pretzels brazil nuts and oranges is what i ate for 10 days but they were delicious as long as i didn't have to eat the tea [Laughter] and god said i'm going to date him this is back before i'm going to bait he just called him kim i'm going to bake him with big business and everybody's going to wipe him out and get him off the face of the earth or else he would do that himself actually god said if i wait much longer he may blow himself up because their stuff doesn't work well he didn't want him to blow himself up he was not happy with what he's doing but guess what his soul was filled with that stuff by his own father it was filled from the time he's little war war war war war and so what did he know war he didn't know what well but that's what he knew so god said i'm going to shift his heart and focus to big business and he will want to do the business when he sees it so he used the olympics as bait here's south korea making millions of dollars from people all over the world coming to see those olympics and when the person who sent there to check it out came back and said do you know what there is no fear they don't have fear all those people coming to visit and they're all applauding and yelling and cheering and they're spending money and spending money and spending money but no one's afraid because they're happy they're celebrating something we don't even think about i don't think they had a team did they anyway they weren't thinking in that way because the mind of their leader was not even considering that would be possible he was actually in fear that's why he was always wanting a war and wipe out people before they got and he was living with fear in him and god said i'm shifting him to consider doing big business and that's what his focus is he still has a lot of changes i'm not by any means saying he is perfect but his focus has shifted amen and if people don't like it they've been around him they won't last very long because he already has seen evidence that you can have a different life so don't don't consider don't just consider that no one you know all things are possible with god and that's not the only country he's going to do that to he's going to shift governments and then when he shifts the government he will shape the nations and doors will open for us to go and share the gospel where we never could before and it's going to be a long window not a short few weeks or months there's people that believe what i say but there's one thing they don't agree with they think that the rafters coming in about three months but they said that six years ago i went just no we don't want to discuss that right now i'm discussing what is the now time of god that's the future you can't change it you can't make it happen you don't know that day so how about if we just agree together to do what god wants us to do now amen amen so one of the focuses on heaven is to shift nations that is by reaching the leaders of those nations or removing that leader and putting one in there that will be shifted so you're going to see a lot of activity around this world especially in governments and some of them may not be the ones you expected to do something but korea is a good example because this i know there's wars and rumors of wars there'll be more rumors than wars and when something like that happens it won't be a long one because the other side will be dealt with swiftly and quickly because this is a different time on the earth well how can you talk like that because it's what god is saying this is what he wants now we're not living the way we did 50 years ago or even 20 years ago we're not living that way we have a whole new way we could live called heaven culture and there's a way you live that we're not automatically just going to be showered with little fuzzy things and the next day everybody's going to live on earth like they did in heaven we have to be living examples of that and people will see our lives we'll be a living testimony on this earth and you can have a life like they do in heaven and what is that like no fear no wars no hate no laugh no sickness no disease excitement joy celebration adventure the presence of god everywhere in your life that's the way they live in heaven that's heaven culture honor is given to people no one is rejected there's no offense there's no regrets there's no worry about regrets in heaven no one's going to be feeling feel like that they were crushed down because they didn't do right on this earth you remember your life but you use it to the glory of god and what he did and how much he loved you to make sure you got there amen amen so this is this is a whole new time and he's not saying you can't come if you're in this denomination if you have to be in this denomination too common to be a part of this otherwise you just can't come that's not from heaven either no there's one requirement if you receive and believe in your heart that jesus christ died for your sins and you repent for those sins and he washes you inside with a shower of his blood and wipes all that away like it never happened and you are counted righteous and your name is written in the lamb's book of life then your whole focus should change with god's focus on you because people who are not believers cannot do these things they do not have power over the part of the enemy the host will not listen to anyone who is a non-believer they're not going to listen to them they can see inside of everybody you either have light or you have gray or you have darkness in your soul that's what's there there's either light darkness or gray you don't want gray amen and the enemy because those are spiritual beings they see spiritual things about you now i don't give them any ammunition i'm not giving them any ammunition i have ammunition i'm going to focus on them but with all that you get with what god has planned for us right now you also can have uh your greatest desires in your heart yes that are for good it will be his pleasure to give those to you amen when you start operating like this when you start pursuing heaven culture your needs become this is what he personally told me your knees become his responsibility and your desires become his pleasure the people living in utter darkness who don't know any of this they see no hope they don't even think they have a future that's why it's important for us to be a living testimony amen and we live in one of the greatest countries in this world we do another country's focusing on is is of course israel and i knew something major was going to happen in israel god said i'm going to bless them every time they get attacked every time someone threatens to attack them i'm going to bless israel they're going to walk in favor with me divine favor with me and i will give great friends who are jews to americans who know me and they will do big business together and jews know how to do big business trust me he said i will bless them above measure and it will protect them and it will keep them they will not be wiped out he said america belongs to me and now the greatest friends is the the one who who is over israel the one who's over america are now great friends together and so both blessed both will be greatly blessed because of this so you can see more blessings coming and for the first time in a long time because a lot of the warring has stopped because now of course you know of course our embassy's over there and israel's embassy has been shifted to where it should have always been yeah and i mean trump pretty much said if you attack them you're attacking us we will come after you because he's he is serious about being friends with his not going to give billions of dollars away to our enemies amen so justice is coming to this country to our lives and there's a whole atmosphere of justice that was actually just shifted into our country because of the supreme court more and more you will see justice for believers who get dragged into court who have court cases uh and they're innocent more and more you will hear because in the past you'd always hear they've either taken it somewhere else you're going to retry it they found something else you actually hear real justice being given to them amen so this is a real powerful time a time to celebrate and to be joyful for us and if you have family members that don't like you know our president just pray for them and let them love them and let them live their life they're still going to benefit from all of it anyway and i have found this to be true you yourself probably can't change their mind a lot of people wear themself out trying to prove to their family members that they need jesus and it's probably going to be someone else in this world that does that not you pray for them hug them love them let them know you love them you're praying for them but don't get into fights every time you come together okay make sure you have time for love for family and you may notice a little bit of change in them if they don't think every time you come it's going to come up get in your prayer closet send the host of heaven against the demonic trying to control their lives release the anointing into them that's what breaks the yoke of darkness over them there are things that you can do but don't waste your whole life that's right you know trying to convince somebody that doesn't want that you cannot make them take it amen it has to be a choice i do know that major restorations are coming from families who've been apart for years and you may see a lot of that happening this christmas especially this christmas god's marking is a time a major time for restoration and family members to break down those barriers between them so you can expect to hear about that happening or you might have that happen yourself that god's in that time in in that christmas christmas season will be a time of great restoration for families in this earth so and heaven does heaven does like christmas by the way [Music] you wouldn't make christmas town in heaven if you've never heard the truth about uh nicholas and how he lived his life when he was on this earth you don't really know what he was like he was not a necessarily the happiest person in the world he was tough he was hard and he did not like anyone who spoke against the gospel he would take his staff and use it for other purposes yes go watch saving christmas oh yeah i think um kirk cameron kirk cameron made a movie called saving christmas everybody should look that up and watch it you should watch it he tells the true story he tells the true story about nick or nicholas and how his life was back in his day and it is quite humorous but it's quite true and you see a whole different way to explain christmas or celebrate christmas but god loves it he loves all the lights he likes the gift giving he loves the fact that sometimes it is the only time in someone's life that they forgive yes it is sometimes it's the only time of the year that they actually give money to others to help them amen it is really it's not something bad that link everything to some satanic ritual that was way back when but i have news for you heaven was there before all that stuff was here and all the enemy did was he takes it he copycats it and so that it looks like it's all evil when he's taking something that's good that's from god and he hates god so in any way he can make something look bad he never makes anything look good except sinning so a lot of the things that he says that everybody thinks now halloween that belongs to satan that's right don't celebrate it for the same reason i would tell you to you know get on heaven's side look up all right uh all those evil practices they show in in the halloween it is satan's highest day of the year and he wants people to celebrate his images and and it also brings fear into people especially children and you do draw things to you so you don't want to wear any kind of image that belongs to the enemy and i don't mind if you don't want me to say that anymore you don't want to hear me anymore don't listen to it but i'm telling you truth because i'm a seer and i see the things that follow those kids down the street when they're wearing like ghoulish things or demonic things you're saying come on yes because you're wearing your image that's right amen so everybody's listening everybody here do not celebrate that day and one day we will our company have a festival of light on that same day and we will celebrate heaven on that day and we'll celebrate life and joy and happiness and goodness and uh we are going to make calendars and on october 31st on that calendar it will say celebrate life we will not honor even mention the other side amen and i know my dad will tell us all the time don't go out and do that well my mom would let us because she was never churched or anything and my dad would pray and pray and pray that we would never be affected by it he just had a connection to heaven and eventually i saw it being you see i'm like okay i could tell you dad what i saw and after that we wouldn't we wouldn't do it anymore we would give stuff out we didn't shut our door and shut people out we would give them a track with a piece of candy when they came to the door okay we'd have it wrapped around or is a part of it we would give it to them they're not gonna throw it away okay they'll take it home drive it home take it out of their bag and it'll be put somewhere but somebody might see it so we do bless people we bless people we know a lot of them don't have a clue about that but uh you know i'm always going to tell you the truth amen celebrate christmas yes give people gifts that have helped you throughout your life and maybe you've never said thank you it could be something simple you know i don't know the guy in the toll booth who has you know has to take your money all day long and go over the bridge we don't have those anymore in our city thank you god there was one person who ran for mayor nobody ever remembers anything about him but one thing he got rid of the toe booth that was his election promise and he actually kept it none of the rest of them so we remember him so i just want you to stay excited about this time and uh i have a few more minutes we're going to stop and take up an offering the holy spirit said don't miss letting them give so we're going to go ahead and take up the offering and uh to be a partner with us and what we do and i tell people what you're doing is you're helping to reveal heaven on this earth when you help uh partner with us and you give to us and you're blessing heaven at the same time because this is heaven's plan i did not sit in my room one day and come up with all this that was not on my list my list was i will be in big business one day and i will have a nice loft apartment somewhere and it will only be me father son and holy spirit with a wonderful life that was my plan i only got one part of that plan father son and holy spirit with me for the rest of my life [Laughter] they had their own plan and i was push whacked [Laughter] so and the other thing i'm gonna ask also is anybody who's watching this if you have not given to river rock church i would not be here sharing these words if he had not invited me that's right so even if he's met his expenses i would like for you to go to his site and give money to them they have a big project ahead of them they're going to help people with are you kidding is what my dad and all of us kids did for most of our lives we took food to people we took supplies to people we helped them move into homes we painted seniors homes we we have a heart to help so that's what i see with all this yeah and they didn't ask for it okay this is the thing they did not ask for this this was god's plan if you've given yourself to god expect the unexpected amen this is the unexpected but that is not normal for major companies to call you up and say i have traffic trainer loads of stuff to give to you do you want it i know people who beat dom the doors of those places say can you give some stuff to us to help with our project they didn't even say that they don't even have a place to put it and yet here it is and it's coming and it's not going to stop so they need a warehouse and not some cheap one that they have to spend half a million dollars fixing i want them to have a wonderful one amen amen so please give if you have not given and you're watching this you need to send some money to pastor eric at river rock church for this project amen and then you have a part of that reward no matter where it happens this is how god does he will give you reward like eric will get because you're helping him to do this he didn't ask me to do this god told me to do it he said you're going to bless my son eric you're going to bless riverrot who's invited you time and time again no matter how wild you are or the things that you say he obeys you obey i want to help him this is my plan it's his plan eric so you're not going to escape it so people please remember them but right now we're going to take up an offering uh for me to help me in what i do we have a lot of big plans weather warriors is gonna be one of them he's not gonna let us drop that and uh our whole women's thing we have will go worldwide the wonder women and now we're adding on top of that something for all the men called the dread champions because hell will drive you if anybody does anything it should be held dreading you amen you wake up in the morning they start getting terrified and so we have a lot of things we have our wonder woman event coming up we have our champions event coming up and next year we'll also add to that our host initiative event and our spirit realm boot camp which every member of the body of christ needs that so they know what the spirit realm is what happens there what authority do you have there how do you use that authority why is it necessary to know about in your life because the veil between the spirit realm and the natural realm is getting thinner we we really hope to see an angel one day one day they'll be everywhere and you will see them but there will be both sides and the other side will try to influence people too and you'll see them so why not know this is going to happen on this earth it's going to happen and so you're hearing this it's going to happen you will see angels you'll see them in your home living in your hands home going back to heaven and forth in your home they may have some come to the front door and knock and the other side will be happening they'll be trying to make friends with people and trying to prove that they're good too i'm talking about demons because so many of the kids games and videos and movies are actually helping to introduce them as something that is normal and so you have to have a voice that tells you this is going to happen it's important to know about this and people change when they have spirit around boot camp and they understand that's not just a mysterious unseen realm that is a real literal round where things travel in it there's highways in it there's places in it there's things that you need to know about that's where your real authority is when you speak and take authority your king or uh your king a priest or a lord in the spiritual level of authority so you have to know what that spiritual what that spirit realm is amen so make up checks to river rock church and then they'll just give me one check and i think you at the envelopes that are there in front of you somewhere i think you can give me your card if you want to and i will bless all of it in just a few minutes i i don't like to stop talking because i know i only have a little bit of time left here tonight because we also have what's tomorrow sunday so they have sunday morning and um and uh is my meeting sunday night 6 p.m and so so they got two meetings tomorrow they got their regular sunday morning meeting and then i will be back six o'clock tomorrow night here there's three meetings here that eric invited me to and then monday night um they're holding one here for the women's up for a glow international what used to be women's above the seventh of god they've changed it to a glow international so the men can come too and i've i've done a global international meetings and some people are surprised that the assembly god lets me speak but when i was growing up that was the denomination we went to we went there we were faithful we helped our our pastor and we're on part of his volunteer team and we love them they helped put a lot of god in us they put us on that right road that's where i got saved i was in the assembly god church my dad was a lay minister with them and my grandmother was a missionary so we do love that denomination and they're getting more and more of holy spirit in heaven they want the supernatural they want to know about heaven encounters and so monday night we will have another meeting here so i'm not done amen so please get ready to give your offering and uh we're going to let them take it up i'm not going to sing a song to you thank you would leave or you would cry i said well i've seen people cry not from the anointing not my gift all my kids were fussed in the back of the car i would sing and they would cry and they would repent and they would stop when they got older it would make me sing in the car with their friends when they were about 11 or 12. they wanted to make them laugh too maybe in heaven one day but on the earth that's not my gift and i don't dance either although i teach a dance to everybody we might do that tomorrow night the revelation dance it's like children you feel like children right there doing this and i'm wrong yes i saw it down in the phone i'm like well god said you're going to teach it and let me and then my daughters looked at me and went we don't have to help do we because i've been thrown out of jazzercise classes [Laughter] i was on like the step thing right little step thing you've never been there don't don't unless you know what you're doing and they do like step one two one two one one two two and they were like on step fifteen and i'm like one two or is it one one two and i looked up and everyone in the mirror was watching me and and i was like down front somewhere with my sister who dragged me in there not down john didn't drag me there and the instructor stopped saying okay you back there you yeah you you are going to go to the back of the room in the corner because you can't keep up and everyone is trying to do except now they're watching you so would you go back there please that didn't hurt my feelings i told my sister this is not going to work so i'm in the in the back in the corner i'm still doing the same thing you know is this one two one one two because i have not gifted in that either and again the music was rocking and people were doing nothing because then they were trying to look behind everybody in the mirror to see what i was doing so i was asked to leave and i was like yes amen i believe now that was pretty much the same thing that happened to me in eighth grade when i tried out for chorus i wasn't always bold you know i would go for it anyway and they so they had the auditions you know how that happens they let anybody anybody who wants you to be in the course just come audition so we know where to place you and i went and they were singing that dough ready me thing and i'm halfway through and the people are laughing so hard they're crying i'm saying the director was crying the people there to audition were crying and go stop this is the joke isn't it and what yes it is that was not written on my scroll but by speaking wildly and boldly about what god wants regardless of what people think about you to not care when people bash me or whatever they try to do um i don't know they make yourself a target on uh facebook or youtube or twitter and whatever that new thing is we're gonna be doing instagram instagram and we're already doing podcasts we're going to be doing webinars guys it'll put you out a lot more online and i just ignore everybody out there i do not have time to stop and justify myself and uh i don't have time it's wasting time i just start with you know i love you but you're banned [Laughter] we got a lot of banding done during the election i mean like a lot of people those three nights when god said i'm going to tell you all the characteristics and the qualities of this person i have chosen for president and everybody was trying to guess who that was and and our viewing audience went from like it went from like you know 20 30 000 to 200 000 overnight and then 800 000 because and so on that fourth day when i had when god revealed who it was i have not chosen a pastor for your president i have not chosen an apostle or i mean i went through the whole five whole thing i haven't chosen any of those because you don't need them i have chosen a businessman and this name is donald j and it was like bash back like we were up all night long you know trying to get all the bachelors off of here and i think that what really very quite really a whole lot was a very small percentage but the rest of them were celebrating celebrating celebrating and then they went to the voting booth and they voted amen so it was worth it and this is god saying this to me this is the father he said i'm gonna throw you so far out there you are never coming back i'm putting you on a political platform a lot of people aren't going to like what you say but i like it so i'm just letting you know your life is going to be over completely because i'm following you out there and i'm not bringing you back off that political platform and trump's winning and i don't care what anyone says because i'm voting this time and i'm turning that map red so whether they like it or not this is going to happen and you're going to let them all know and i said amen and i had pastors calling me saying are you sure you want to say that you you are you know you're risking your entire reputation now i thought we weren't supposed to have one amen is that not true so this is not my reputation that i'm ruining at all no i don't have a reputation i don't even have an opinion i'm just going to say what god wants and a lot of times that's never popular so why should it be any different amen amen people can fight and kick all they want to you will watch trump re-elected in 2020 and then you will see pence elected and then can three elect him and i don't know who he's gonna pick but god's still talking to me about that person whoever pence picks for his vice president and he will seriously consider that he's a very strong believer seriously whoever he picks is going to win yes because pence will win that term and then they will be president also this other person for eight years 24 years of god in our white house there will be so many major chips you know into into what god wants in this country and god has told me that doesn't mean that that i won't let other people still win he said at one point it will be a moderate there will be a moderate person elected uh this is after pence's vice president and after all that he said but even still that i'm so rad if we change america people will come here to find god they'll come to find me amen they'll get the american dream some of them but that won't be their focus the folks will become to find me amen so you can celebrate your lives and your children your grandchildren your great grandchildren will live in a whole different time that we didn't live in amen and i'm 66 i'm still young god calls me a baby you know uh america is a baby he says america is a baby amen yes we're only a couple hundred years old yes when you put us up to england and these other countries and see how long they've been around that israel you know china how long have they been here we are a baby and saint wants to destroy the baby he's always afraid of the baby he always has been well we're a baby but we're going to grow up amen we're going up strong and happy and filled with god and uh there'll still be things arise in our country but they'll be dealt with swiftly there will be no anarchy in the streets in our country that we know is trying to overthrow each other in our country which has always been one of the devil's plans and he doesn't know what he's messing with and this is what god said when they kept trying to say there's going to be you know anarchy in the streets and then the international guard will be called and take control of everything and there's half a million body bags waiting in uh in missouri for the bodies what happened from all this war in the streets and god's like laughing in heaven he said that's not my plan and that is not going to happen he said besides the fact that they don't understand that they aren't ever going to get their weapons god said they won't ever get their guns in america there's too many he rednecks that there's too many rednecks in america they all got guns they're not giving any of them up but they will use them so they can forget about getting their guns because it is our right to protect ourselves in other countries that are like third world countries that happened because they took away the right to bear arms they have no voice in their country they have no way to protect themselves in their country that's why they're crushed down and god said leaders who are presidents can be great leaders in the way if they want good for their country and if they want to do what is right for the country then their country can be great he said but dictators if you're a dictator then you hate what is right most of the time you only want what you want it has to be only your way and you crush if you don't get your way you take away all the rights of the people that way they can be controlled they can only operate oh it sounds like the market of east and then they can only operate the way you allow them to operate he said but america is not that country amen and i will pray for all of us stand up and pray for those other countries right now that are going through shifts in their government that they will hear god and they will do what is right amen amen so we say we can all repeat this god our father jesus christ our king our king holy spirit our best friend we stand in the gap for all those countries that don't have justice liberty or freedom we pray on their behalf that you will help them open the eyes of their leaders to see what is right and to go after what is right we pray those people be loved and cared for they will have no more wars or poverty or disease in their countries we pray that you will bless them and if necessary remove the wicked leaders because when the righteous rules the people rejoice that we declare over those countries we thank you for putting us in america we thank you for blessing america and we say god bless this world you made it with your hands you love this earth help us to love more and care more for others and let it be honored as it is in heaven amen [Music] amen and so father i just blessed all the people who came tonight ask you to bless them when they rise up and when they lie down let them have visions let them have dreams father let them have encounters in heaven let them visibly see their destiny to know why you sent them to know you more to receive revelation and i pray that their souls will prosper father and they will prosper and live in divine health and have declare over each one of them increase in every way for their giving tonight god let it multiply even as it was given and let it multiply in their bank accounts in their purses in their wallets that people bring money unexpected money unexpected suddenlies of their finances to shift overnight god and i declare a hundred and a thousand folk return over this offering father like if their restoration with their loved ones god that there will be peace between them father let's just be the best christmas they have ever had father let joy and celebration be in their hearts and a great future for their destiny father and i declare over their seed over their children and over their grandchildren and over their great great great grandchildren to a thousand generations god may they know you love you serve you may they all be together in heaven and in the future and i bless them and ask you to show you show them your goodness is everyone sad amen thank you and everyone also watching i bless you all so that blessing is for you too and everyone say hello world we bless you we bless you god bless your people amen

or https://youtu.be/qpZ-9GcqyWs
welcome everybody here we are catker on studio oq one haven't you ever wondered in these days it would be great if we just knew the truth because let me tell you there's crazy wild things going on out there see look i dress professional does that help people to believe because actually you know god's revelations are for those who will receive them not for those who bash them so today you will hear god's reality and jen is pointing her finger at me oh hi i'm looking in the wrong place see we flipped our ipad because you know our our professional crew they're not here today it's just jen and i you know why we love you and never forget we love you if everything went down for a while i hope you would be careful about how much cake you're eating [Laughter] we will be addressing that before we're done tonight you now this is going to be a short broadcast number one my husband's waiting to eat and i've learned from men if the world's falling apart which it's not if they're at war in a bunker where the missile is flying past them that probably doesn't happen that way however i will tell you this men have to eat all you women who are married say amen because i have been married for 43 years and this is not about my marriage but why not bring it into play i have learned how to get along with my husband and love him not want to run him out of town on a rail some of you if you're in your 10th 12th year of marriage you may feel that way please hang in there okay god brought you that man and you know what i will address this another guy the holy spirit said continue on with what you have to say and they have asked me to talk about god's reality which is actually the thing we should want to know the most and actually his reality is the truth a lot of fake news going on everybody you've known that for months probably years but right now with the stuff going on right now in washington dc and everything else there's a lot of stuff being flown out there for you to listen to or you to watch i hope you find some truth in some of it some of it's like so far out there is from outer space some of us just on wi-fi space some of it i'm not quite sure where it's from i just know one thing i listen to god i hear him well i have known him for some time now which is his decision to put me out there i was always the person that wanted to hide because i didn't need anybody uh personally i had a try therefore i had all the validation or war that i wanted so right now i can persevere and continue on i forgive everyone out there please do not waste your time trying to explain to people who don't want to hear an explanation or who don't want the truth just pray for them and ignore them like they said nothing whatsoever because that's actually the best thing you can do and i know because more people are watching and listening you're always going to get more of the side that is clueless who hates everybody who has their own mindset and doesn't want anyone else's who are just angry and they want to vent on everybody right now i happen to be a bull's-eye but i'm also a bull's-eye for god that part i love so i forgive everybody in advance god act like they never said it especially if it was one of your prophets jumping off the path off the train or out into nowhere please forgive them and help them to know the truth so they can be free they can be powerful for you and not a voice for the enemy because right now the reality god's reality is this is not a doom and gloom time this is not a time to be in fear to tolerate fear or participate with fear it's a time to be great with god excited about his plans and please pursue making plans for your life like you were before all this ever happened because it will be like it never happened and that is god's reality he has a moment in time to shift us and accelerate us forward but before he does that he will cleanse the platform expose the darkness and boy is there a lot of that to expose and it doesn't matter what group it's being disposed from it will be exposed in this time and god will also deal with it in this time why because of all the powerful things he has planned for us i have been there i have seen it it is going to be great your children's future is so fantastic it will not be filled with fear it will not be filled with evil it will not be filled with having to run and escape somewhere hide under your school desk you know that's not what's happening right now it's god asking us to trust him until his time comes to show it all and trust me you wonder what time is going to happen you will see it you'll see the exposure you'll see the arrest you'll see the fraud he will not let anyone escape with justice not being brought to them justice will be served that's what he says so wait for the justice people is so worth it to love your family spend time with them go on as normal as you possibly can until it's wiped out disposed of put away wiped off and god will set in place the ones he trusts to speak to you now we have several things we want to talk about in this broadcast so i'll just give you a little what is it called an outline an index whatever you want to call it okay we will discuss the reality of what god is doing right now we will discuss the earthquakes that started the shaking that god said on november the 4th of 2020 when the ground begins to shake wait for the great exposure of fraud to begin to happen and when it's done it will all be dealt with it will all be brought to justice i don't need to name any names to let you know that this is what he's doing so on november the 4th things started shaking and guess what even up to right now they are still shaking not just here in america all over the world some of them cannot even be explained why because sometimes in the spirit realm what they're doing is so powerful there's always a little bit of that that laps over into this natural realm and people can feel it sometimes they can hear it and let me tell you that shaking and the winds being released that is god moving on this earth yes i mean the father moving on the earth you remember what happened the first time he did that the mountains caught on fire well he wants your souls to catch on fire for him not in fear not thinking you needed to be rescued this is god's reality now we've jumped to that subject god has a reality and his reality is this is a powerful exciting time to be alive he has never changed that some people have changed it some people are jumping off that train right now thinking that we're going to be derailed and there'll be a crash i think the future will take a crash because you cannot speak for god saying adamantly this is what he has said and this is what he's going to do and just because you don't know the time you think it's not gonna happen that is an immaturity in the prophets of god you need to know if he says something to you or showed you and said this will happen just because it's not a year window of time or man's window of time it doesn't mean it won't happen you can't back up you can't stop going forward the true prophets of god right now are speaking greatness the power of god the joy of the lord celebration celebration celebration is coming to america that's what his true prophets are saying if you hear them saying there's doom and gloom let's go we're going into the deep darkness guess who they're listening to not god the enemy has a voice too and when you accept fear he'll make sure satan well make sure you hear his voice and then you'll believe it and then you run after it and then you repeat it does this sound like a cycle i can tell you right now god wants you to believe him and trust him satan does not hold your life in his hand that doesn't happen to the very end and you most likely won't be here unless you're several hundred years old you are in the greatest days god designed to be on the earth he's just setting it up i'm sorry it didn't happen on the third i'm sorry it didn't happen so far in january that doesn't mean he's not doing it no because i do have something a lot don't i has a seer anointing if you were a prophet and you could see into the spirit you would right now see demons quaking in fear sliming their way to get out of the way because they know and they can see god is walking across this nation they're terrified now because they know their plans are going up in smoke literally they're running away as fast as they can so they don't get burnt by the fire of god and let me tell you your prayers are so powerful when you stand with god and you make declarations it begins to release something in the spirit realm that does cause fear and the camp of the enemy the enemy is not man the enemy is satan he just uses man he uses him for his own purposes to speak his words to say what his plans are his plans are never good and they don't bring hope or joy to anybody so don't listen to anyone who's speaking in doom and gloom and hate and cowering and having to put up with a horrible future maybe they want that future i don't the moral majority in this country don't want that future the true body of christ who are all knowing that god is going to move his hand when he is ready whether it is tomorrow or not you may hold your finger out and say you're fake news you're a fake leader we don't receive you we don't celebrate what you've said because fraud has been committed not sure that facebook will let me keep this one up make sure you're taping it make sure you make a copy of it and keep it all right and i'm telling you anything you want to keep that's been said and spoken or written make a paper copy go find your printer if you didn't forget what that was print it so you may hold it in the time i had should you for a few weeks need to do that if not i hope you're taking notes because i will tell you this everything god has spoken that god himself has spoken it will happen and it will be great and there will be celebration in the streets so the reality of god is make your stand and don't be moved and while you're waiting celebrate why does god say celebrate that shows the enemy and your friends that you're standing in faith your faith isn't going to be stolen from you it will be accelerated and guess what all your friends and family that made fun of you will remember the words you said to them and when what god's going to do happens they will be running to you for answers that is the reality of right now this whole week accelerate your faith trust god and let him hear you say that let's say it together father in heaven father in heaven i choose with my will i choose with my will to choose your promises to choose your promise and your plan and your plan over man's over for the enemies or the enemies i am your child i am your child i will serve no more than god i will serve no other you except you your son jesus christ your son jesus and the holy spirit and holy spirit you made everything you made everything you know everything you know everything you have great thoughts for me you have great thoughts for me and great plans for me and great plans those plans those plans i will receive i will receive and i will run after them and i will run after them everything everything is about to change it's about to change jesus name in jesus name amen amen there you go you said it with your own mouth don't step back from those words they are powerful teach your children to celebrate what jesus christ did for them and what his plans are for right now on this earth this is not a joke this is not a recording i'm live see here i'll pinch myself this is a real life this is god's reality all the rest of it is a smoke screen by satan wanting to try to convince us that we're going down life is going down the country's going down that's awfully funny i remember the last time god showed up when satan thought he won he got burnt i can expect to see the same i've seen demons slinking away from everything running from dc as fast as they can you know what that means if the enemy's power is left great confusion will begin to fall on the others get ready for a real show that's all i can say remember whose life you are in their hands right that life is yours the decision is yours the word should be yours that you agree with life and not death god says to choose life and to speak life whatever is a good report sir remind you of the word those words you declare so if you hear things that aren't a good report we know where that came from no matter who is saying them pray for those people do not bash those people man if they ever needed help it would be right now i don't care how major a prophet it is who all of a sudden overnight has decided the bad stuff is going to happen because guess what they're looking with their natural eyes and when god says they begin to do that this is what they see they can see as far as their hand and that's it but when you stay focused on god keep your eyes on him stay excited don't step back on the word and you will be accelerated and you will be prospered and you will be blessed and you will have the greatest memories that you can tell your children and your grandchildren you will not believe what happened in this beginning of this divine decade boy we had to make a stand so remember to celebrate and i will show you the cake in just a minute jen is waving me down keep us on track jen whatever whatever are we supposed to talk about um well you wanted to mention the earthquakes yes november the 4th was when god actually began to talk about what would happen and i can go back on the elijah list and re-share the november 4th uh facebook live with you and steve yeah so everyone can hear when you said that oh yeah that actual uh broadcast was so powerful and really neither one of us probably knew what god would say he just knew he wanted to speak after november the 3rd which of course we know was election day god knew exactly what would happen so it is very powerful that god since november the 4th what he said would happen has been happening you just haven't seen and heard it but trust me you will but on november the 4th that day when he said when the ground begins to shake look for the beginning of the landslide a fraud what happened on november the 4th john well there was a earthquake in yosemite valley california there you go that's the usa and um the thing that we thought was also amazing was the day of the election yes because remember they they they stopped counting they stopped counting at midnight or 1am something like that and then there was a earthquake around 2 58 i'm trying to remember where it was in the morning yeah in the morning that would have been eight pm that would have been the fourth probably when stuff was going earthquake i think it was was it alaska falls pass alaska of all names false past alaska are you kidding is that crazy i think god was saying something yeah and then of course we all know they mysteriously got all those votes that came in at 3am yes hey that's just a few minutes after 2 52 a.m not only that there was a second earthquake in alaska at 5 35 p.m so all those hours going by we're going to find out about all that really soon but where else in the world on november 4th were the earthquakes there was one in canada there was the philippines greece turkey actually many one yeah there was a lot have they stopped since then no not at all but not just the earthquakes there's been mysteriously mysterious ground shakings everywhere that's not reported that's right they don't know where it's come from and also there's been activities a host of heaven people unusual gust of winds that have come out of nowhere yes that were not natural right they weren't like a natural wind i'm telling you god why would god say that about the shaking it's to encourage you and let you know he is doing things that you cannot see right now but everything that is seen this is what the word says everything this scene was made by that which was unseen the unseen is the spirit realm it is a father son and holy spirit's activities and there is a lot of that going on they are driving things out moving things into position that they will need their place there for what is going to happen this week will be key i'm not saying tomorrow i'm not promising anything tomorrow except god won't stop moving and doing things until all of this is shown and you will see it with your natural eyes and hear it with your ears and then there'll be the great celebration your job is to stay in faith stand and stand therefore but don't stand looking sorry and sad and fearful remember please to pray for all those who are backing up apologizing for things they said there's nothing to apologize for people the truth will be made known and no one will escape knowing about it no one will escape being uncovered that did it so pray for those who've jumped off the train and backed up and god pray that they be reached that they know the truth and tell the truth to not get people to fear don't let people put fear in you then the enemy has something in you he can use it won't stop god from what he's going to do but why not enjoy every day of your life let god says you choose to be happy if no one else does heaven is happy heaven is excited we thought we would drink bring these up because we've had a lot of questions the last broadcast we did has already reached a hundred and forty two thousand people what they want to hear somebody who's hearing god and gives them hope god always brings hope so are you saying that even if a certain someone is sworn in on the 20th yes i think and we all wake up on the 21st yes and he still thinks he's in that position it means we should still stand strong stand strong and know this until it's all revealed it isn't over that's right god has the final say and when he says it and when it is all done somebody will be moving back in the white house and guess what they know it too there's no fear in the lives of those who just moved out they already know that they will be back so just remember covert activities hey guys just be thankful god didn't ask us to wait 120 years like he did with noah he's just wanting us to wait a little while so keep holding on it's gonna happen the rain is coming he keeps telling me the rain is coming the rain is the evidence but this time it's the enemy's camp that's going to be flooded and destroyed that's right and we are not for violence of any kind well maybe spiritual violence did you know there's a godly violence a spiritual violence that you wore in the spirit against satan against the demonic armies that is certainly okay we don't want to have violence against people although the group that says they don't want it seem to be doing it you already know what i'm talking about right god didn't intend us to have to put up or tolerate violence not in this country not in our lives actually not for those who believe him in this day you won't have to die to show who god is but you will have to live and live powerfully and rule and reign with christ in this world right now and he is not afraid was there anything else we were going to talk about jenna oh yes the holy spirit just reminded me guess what i still have lights on outside if at all possible go put some lights back up maybe you haven't taken them down the light represents god so let's leave some light up until the real inauguration happens maybe leave up the red lights red and white lights very white would be great that would be great but if you only got white we'll take that we're leaving ours up i hope you leave yours up i hope they're seeing everywhere and people go blows up we have hope for a future we are trusting our god our god is light why not put something up outside or in your window that represents god that's who our savior is that's someone who loves us that's the one who made you even the other side who's very confused right now i know jen wants to hurry so she can have cake yes by the way we will now discuss the cake when i said eat cake i didn't mean eat a whole cake i know some of you are taking advantage of that i know i have seen the comments okay when this is over you may have to have a flash weight loss program we will help you with that too right now just eat a little piece so here's my cake to explain this is a piece of cake but i will be eating this part of it you see the little piece cut out right there you may have

moderation people [Laughter] celebrate every day that victory is ours i said should i say it's coming god should i say it's almost here he said you say it's yours victory is ours okay so remember eat

any one of these or well you know i got to eat dinner first you know what time is it oh it'll be hours before i eat so i'm not praying for all of you trust me i'm praying for you to be strong not just strong to be dangerous against hell why not be strong be powerful enjoy this time in your life that you were born in an epic time we can stand with god and not be moved and see the fruit of our lips

facebook viewers this is an amazing time we have some new software now everything will automatically be on youtube and facebook at the same time i look forward to new people if you don't know anything about me there's about 500 hours of me already on youtube how about that and it's all for free and by the way i wanted to mention this if you go watch some of my videos and there's commercials on those videos those were not put on there by me i did not put those commercials on there that was done through other people who show things that i do also i'm not going to put commercials on anything that i do i do it for you to enjoy to know more to be more to run your race powerfully in this time to crush the darkness and i do want to also mention besides the connection between youtube and facebook we also have a couple of new things we're doing and this is a real fun thing it's called on the go with cat you never know when that's going to be posted we have some new ones make sure you check out our playlist on itunes is that itunes no not itunes it's on youtube eventually maybe itunes but right now go to youtube check out our playlist for on the go with cat and it's going to be spontaneous things throughout the day places i go things that do or say we're just gonna we're gonna tape it and then we're gonna post it and you'll get to know more about what i do during the day it's not normal okay now you can check out the intro and you can check out the new intro right now we've actually created an intro for on the go with cat so when you see that you're going to know this is going to be something exciting or fun or interesting and so if you're watching [Music] so anyway that was awesome wasn't it anyway i love doing things where i can connect with people you know i come from a really big family for those who don't know me at all guess what what about the pink hair i am going to answer that question we recently had a question from somebody why do you have the pink hair so there's some people who've known why for like 15 years right i've had this pink hair for a very long time it's because god asked me to have this pink hair why heaven is different it is fantastic it is amazing and i represent heaven wherever i go and he wanted me to show it on the outside so how about that heaven's exciting and because he asked me to do it i obeyed i think god would appreciate it when we listen we hear and we obey that is what he loves so this is just really obedience of course i was not a pink care person that would make it too easy for me but i have gotten used to it and i want to bless the heart of god and so guess what yes i get it done every four weeks god didn't put this pink hair on my head i actually have to pay for it so again guardians own people thank you so much for supporting me we have many things planned for the future it's going to be really exciting around here and a lot of action going on not just here in our studio but around this world don't take your eyes off of korea god is still doing something with that also hollywood i am involved now in helping to create a spirit realm input for the resurrection of jesus christ movie and by the way i just need to give a tip it's not the one with mel gibson we bless mel gibson and pray for him continually he gave us a passion was that not amazing but this one is being done through a different whole group you go to the resurrection of jesus christ website you'll probably see me talking on that website and find out some more information they'll be putting a lot more on there we're working really hard i do sketches of the spirit realm of heaven of hell because i've been to those places and then my prophetic artist makes them amazing and these are scenes and images and beings that will actually be in that movie so god notified me that i would be involved in this several years ago so i was preparing myself all along to be a part but it's absolutely amazing that we will get to change the way people think about jesus christ about heaven about how the reality of both of those places and also what really happened in the spirit realm in the garden on the cross in hell on the third day when christ wasted the principalities and powers and took the keys of hell death and the grave you'll be seeing on the big screen in a few years it's it's a it's a big project but i'm going to enjoy being a part of it we do a lot of on the on the go with cat you see a lot of those things happening and i give you tips about what goes on with the making of a movie and so i'm looking forward to being a part of that also don't take your eyes off of london especially concerning the royalty boy there's stuff going on right now isn't there we're gonna hear about that from here too uh i'm sure that i have we'll have a lot more to share later but uh we love queen elizabeth we pray for her we pray for that whole country you know we america was kind of birthed out of that country i do know in the habitation of god coming to this earth that america and england will be doing things hand in hand for that move of god in this earth so don't take your eyes off of there either there's a lot of other things going on in this world i know there's violence in some areas there's disasters in some areas we're learning to take authority over all that because as a believer that is your right to rule and reign with christ to have authority over the weather because we're over it not under it we also host weather warriors here we host um the the host initiative which is the army of heaven working with us we also of course i already mentioned drug champions and wonder women we have a lot going on god has put on our plate and we're going to be doing great with all those things don't take your eyes off of trump now that's hard to do right because you know this broadcast couldn't go by without me mentioning trump who will win in 2020 look forward to celebrating with him i already am i'm sure that i'll be at the um inaugural prayer breakfast in washington dc uh last time i actually got to pray for not in person but i did pray for the president for pence and at that time it was awesome i will be doing a capitol hill broadcast sometime this year i'll let you know in advance if you're in washington dc at that time stop by the capitol outside and say hi to us i'll make sure you get those days it's going to be amazing god will be exposing darkness but i'm telling you he chose trump and he has not done with him yet i look forward to all that god is going to do through him through his administration and you know don't worry about the fake news okay don't worry about him on you are fake news okay you fake your fake news yes and guess what even heaven goes about that heaven's talking about all the stuff going on on the earth it's not like they're blinded from it they understand what's going on everybody's declaring and decreeing for things on this earth god cares about you he hasn't forgotten about you no matter who you are he loves you he sent his son to die for you and something new that god gave us assignment on was to put out a 20 20 calendar excuse me let me take a little drink from my i don't do demons cup there you go this is something that he had us actually i know it's probably already on there but you know i'm a hands-on person so here we go i'm not going to show you a lot about it he actually commissioned us to do a calendar on heaven itself and is called the world called heaven we still have some left if you haven't gotten yours go to revealingheaven.com click on the store and get your calendar every month there's an image of a place that actually exists in heaven it also talks about that place that i saw in heaven and in during the month the dates of that month we've added some special days that we've included about celebrating heaven or life we have two interactive months in this calendar where you actually send pictures of something to us and we're gonna have a lot of fun with that but this is a powerful calendar you're gonna know so much about heaven it makes a great gift for somebody no matter what time of year you give it to somebody it'll be something they'll probably keep for a very long time so i hope you'll check out uh our store make sure you check out the calendar a world called heaven last year we did one on the host of heaven and for the first time god really is revealing heaven in images on this earth because we work for god and this is heavens one of heaven's bases on the earth one quest international with one purpose from one god that is to reveal and create heaven on this earth i hope you will check us out again i look forward to talking to you again i'm just going to mention anything else jen on the calendar we have fun days like you were saying and the fun day for this month is um download from the idea zone day oh download from the idea zones that day that gives me another subject to talk about what does that mean there is an idea zone in heaven literally over the streets of gold there's this beautiful cloud that's got all these like thousands and thousands of pieces it looks like little pieces of glitter every one of those is a witty idea an invention and god sends waves of that idea zone down to the earth and drops them into the mind of man that's how we get all those amazing ideas and so we have that date put on the calendar in february make sure if you already have a 2020 calendar you check that date out that would be february the 4th no the third 25th the 25th see you can tell i've really studied this i'm going to have to really check it out a little bit more [Laughter] so anyway um i still are you are you done y'all need to not be pointing at things okay your crew y'all just need to know this is new we have new equipment new lights i'm excited about this so i'm learning right along with you okay is there anything else i need to be saying anything that god wants or anything he wants to say okay well i can tell you right now god's excited about this time he calls it the divine decade the next 10 years are going to be so powerful and so focused by god from heaven about things that will happen you will be amazed if you don't belong to god if you receive jesus christ make sure you do that the most important thing you do in your life is to make sure your name is written in the lamest book of life because you won't like the other option okay been the hell been there seeing that nobody wants to go there but heaven itself is an amazing

and being so happy i hope you are by the way i just want to start by saying i have talked to several my prophet friends just to make sure they're celebrating and guess what they are they have an all jumped ship hope you haven't jumped ship if you have we'll throw you a life raft anyway i had to of course come on i'm gonna come on every other day as long as we're still up i'll still be speaking and guess what i'm running forward with my race running forward with life with joy with celebration and with god in his plans and yes according to the title of this post the shaking has begun and i'm serious about that i'll tell you why i'm excited you should go back and look at on the largest streams the broadcast we did on november the 4th and what god himself had to say about all of this guess what he didn't give a date and i'm not giving a date i actually never have given a date i let god choose his time because man has their own time frame some people can wait a few days some a couple weeks but man i don't think anybody can go past a month except the ones who really know what god said and i can tell you what god's doing yes there is a line being drawn who will believe him and stand with him and who he can use and accelerate in these powerful days ahead and who will have to catch up so i hope you're not on the ketchup side that could mean several things i won't go there however i do want to tell everyone hello all you people who are still standing with what god said i celebrate you i congratulate you you have blessed the heart of god that you're not giving up your stand we all know what the bible says when you make a stand stand therefore you also know what it says right when you're going forward in the kingdom don't stab back or what you will not be fit in shape or ready for the kingdom so there you go that's god's words to you i hope you all who switched and jumped to the side of darkness and that's all there is is darkness and light right now get out of there while you can and be one of the ones who made a stand that you can celebrate and run in the streets and shout and yell that's exactly what's going to happen because life will win god always says to choose life stand with life participate with life not the other side you remember we prayed for mark zuckerberg right so he knows he still has a chance to switch back and do what he did when he started all this he just he designed and made a wonderful place for all of us to come and fellowship together get to see different pictures and videos and laugh and enjoy them and enjoy life and something happened to him please be praying for him okay this is a great place to do social networking and that's why it was designed but you can't let them ban you because you want god or you want what is right or you want life and so in them who don't even know what they're saying you don't realize what you're saying when you don't want to be on the other side and not decide god has chosen if you think he's run away and he's hiding somewhere in heaven that is not true did you feel the groan shake yet because you will you remember on november 4th god himself said when the ground begins to shake get ready for the landslide to expose everything and you know what god's plans are you've heard me say it from the very beginning from 2015 guess what he's not changed his plan what he is do is exposing all the darkness he's going to clean that platform off no matter where they are what they're saying what they're doing god's preparing us for the next 20 years of greatness no you don't have to get used to wearing masks for the rest of your life you don't have to social distance for the rest of your life god intends to actually take the virus off the earth maybe he'll put it with the other ones who were running away i don't know i just know this i know what god's plans are he hasn't changed them and unless he tells me differently i am not changing my stand i will be right here releasing justice releasing the host of heaven and by the way yesterday released 50 billion of the host of heaven and if you did not know this god calls florida over the skies of florida he calls it his battle station on earth what does that mean that means their billions of the hosts posted there to be sent out on assignment and he had me send 50 billion yes people he has a lot no one knows but him you haven't counted them you probably haven't even seen them you'd probably be hiding if you had the host of heaven are not beautiful pretty boys with blonde hair and harps they have weapons coming out of them the frequency of god the fire of god they fight with lightning bolts and guess what some of the ones who've been assigned now are the same ones who fought in the flesh on behalf of israel go back and read it in the bible how one angel took up so many hundreds of thousands that shocked them all we have some of those fighting with us i enjoy commanding the host of heaven and they enjoy going on assignments they need orders from headquarters and let me tell you headquarters in heaven is very excited about these days i know you've heard several times different people sending things around i'm sure some of it's conspiracy stuff some of it's just being made up to make you feel better some of it's actually the real thing you should decide on what you think it is i just say this get plenty of supplies including cake and maybe for a couple weeks or so just to save you a trip to the grocery store this is not a time for death and destruction for us this is not a time for civil war in a civil war you have to have a divided nation we have a pocket of people who'd rather have communism here i said it the rest of us almost 80 million of us that's the majority in case you can't count we want life liberty freedom justice and righteousness in this nation and we are going to get it if god can save a world when eight people are praying how much do you think he can do with millions of people praying for this nation for its destiny and also the impact that will have around this world there are millions and millions of people praying and agreeing with you what you shouldn't do is begin to bash one another you're speaking the enemy's words i'll bash evil all day long then i'm gonna bash the ones he made god sends people to this earth they're already anointed they're already appointed i happen to be just one of those but i will not lose my stand and i will not back up because these are powerful days if people say what's going on their powerful days and when the hand of you god is about to move for you yes you can sit and eat cake and watch you've prayed you've read your word you've laid on your face you've cried out to god guess what he heard you he's not going to ignore your words when they line up with his when your words line up with his they create something that no man and no devil can stop so this is what we have to say go host make toast i can tell you that they were released 50 billion the other day today 10 more billion god had me release two key points in this country and key points around the world to be ready what can they do they can expose things they can speak to people and change the way that they're thinking they can say things of god to their spirit just like the devil says to yours if you're hearing it's all over let's just give it up you're hearing the wrong voice the shaking has surely begun that god spoke up on november the 4th when he said when the ground begins to shake get ready for the great exposure the landslide of exposure that will happen he's not changing who he has chosen to keep in the white house and it doesn't matter to me when god finishes what he's going to start i am celebrating with him he took me forward in time again today and showed me people running into the streets in america laughing they forgot if they didn't like someone of another color nobody cared they were so happy and joyful they were grabbing they were hugging each other without masks people nobody cared because freedom and liberty had come to this country and then he took me and showed me different places around the world when this landslide is done they were running into the streets they were grabbing one another laughing they were dancing they were celebrating that is your future so don't give up don't step back and don't take any fear the only ones who should be afraid are the ones who committed crime i'll tell you who is afraid hell i've seen demons quaking everywhere they're terrified of what is about to happen they know what's going on they know the hosts have been loosed on this earth they know what they've even been assigned to they're running so why not sit down get your popcorn and enjoy the show because it's going to be great people one day will make a movie of all this and people will roar and laugh and clap at the end that's what you should be doing and jen has a report to give a very short report about what god said on november the 4th when the ground begins to shake get ready for the landslide to happen so she's going to come and share with you all just a couple of earthquakes that have taken place uh over the over the last couple days and especially the one that happened on the fourth there you go john come here i'll just stand over here okay go ahead and say it loud then so um there were quite a lot of things that happened especially on the fourth i pulled up an article and i'm trying to find it yeah it's the world earthquake report for monday january 4th 2021 and it said that there were 10. 24th of november january 14th january the 4th okay yeah and it says um 10 of the largest earthquakes in the world happened and it just lists all the different ones and then the ones that were felt were places like croatia and um let's see there was a couple in croatia there was one in south dakota there was new zealand and puerto rico and if you just go and just you can literally see every day from from on this website including and then when she was talking about when she sent the host out um yesterday how many did you send out 50 billion 50 billion you'd hear that well it it's crazy because i pulled up an article this morning when i opened up the internet and it the first thing it said was south florida residents report shaking no official reports of earthquake or explosions and it happened in areas like ballard county miami-dade monroe counties also in um coral i think it's coral coral springs and just various people were reporting that their house started shaking this dad was working with his son doing virtual school when their chairs started to shake and then um the rest of the family came running the room asking what was that because he thought am i imagining this they went outside to see if it was like a big truck there was no big truck they've checked all the size were seismographs the um geographical whatever people that check for for earthquakes they there's no reports nothing none of the graphs moves none of the things and then they said well maybe because there's a lot of military that maybe they were testing the jets because when they they do the sonic boom but they they so they contacted the military bases in the area and they said no we did all our jet testing on thursday nothing was done on friday so at the very end of the article it says the official cause of the shaking and rumbling is not yet known yeah because you can't see the host leave so but you can sure hear them so i did share the article in the link but um there has been a tremendous amount of activity like i even uh googled earthquake um january 12th there was a magnitude 2.9 earthquake in utah um and then that does not mean god will destroy with earthquakes that's letting you know something is happening yeah and if you even do earthquakes for today you just google earthquakes for today it literally shows you a list of all of the ones that happened today uh do they have one here today um in the u.s um let's see i think it was indonesia earthquakes today here we go uh there was uh 5.5 in iran a 5.5 in afghanistan i understand that completely a 5.9 in guatemala a 4.0 in hawaii and this one really when i told you this one there was a 3.6 in conrad california which is smack in the middle between sacramento and san francisco wow and what did you say about san francisco yeah they just put a notice out that they were banning trump from any kind of broadcast or saying anything whatsoever from san francisco in their area in their frequencies and that's exactly where that earthquake happened i think god is saying he's not happy about that so this is just a little heads up to encourage you to let you know that shaking has definitely begun and no one can turn that back nobody can turn back time nobody can stop god from what he wants to do i just want to encourage you all really seriously keep celebration in your heart again god spoke to me and he said don't get off the path i put you on keep encouraging them to celebrate like freedom has already come because it will so we want to remind you whether they're still up tomorrow or not whether anything is taken down i'm talking about the actual social media is taken down as the networks are taken down if all that is taken down you have to remember this god has not changed his mind and do not let fear interfere in your life i'm not going to and i will still be here when it's all done i do need to let you know that i've become so popular with the criminals and criminal activity that they have another fake cat curb it's called decatur facebook page and again they're using the same plot they're trying to trap people into joining and signing up to win a thousand dollars that is not me yes i know that's my face they swiped one of my videos off of my page and used it to prove to you that that was really me i'm letting you know it's not me it is not me i think it's like it's got v then it's got like um a hyphen and then it has cat cur on there it has my picture if you see me in my studio sitting next to my uh portrait of the peacock and that's the picture they've used that's a fake one go on there and tell them i'm not falling for it you're a fake you know let them know that you're not happy about that whatever you do do not sign up to receive anything there is no money they want to steal your personal identification i do not do things like that i bring you revelation from heaven i'll let you know what's going on around the world what god is saying from heaven but i'm not going to do any kind of crazy things like that so don't fall for it because people actually are that's that's my picture but that that is not my facebook page and once again i want to remind people that cat does not know how to send private messages so she will never send a friend request a private message and she doesn't tag people i don't even know what a tag is a dog tag i don't know she doesn't tag people in comments on her post saying you've won money so please just report the people don't click on any links to see if you won money because report that they cannot cash fake it's not me okay they're using my stuff to get to people they already did it once before and now they're they started a whole new page and you know everybody knows people can share stuff from anybody's pages but when they use it for criminal activity they should be stopped and brought to justice at any case let them know you're not falling for it you know they're fake you know it's a lie and then report them please again it would be have a picture of me sitting on the sofa next to my uh beautiful uh artwork that somebody gave me i held it up so they could see it yes you saw it okay if you see that picture it's a fake here i am right here in my studio i'm alive okay just watch for anything that looks like i'm asking you for money or i'm having prizes to give away that's not going to happen or if i if you give me money i'll give you a personal word yeah i don't do that either you can't pay for words people god has something to say he'll make sure you get it i bring corporate words to the body of christ and even words to the government even words to this world but i'm not going to do that so i care about you so we want to let you know what's going on and i should be back hopefully tomorrow maybe if we're still up then we will be here and i want to encourage all of you thank you guardians for helping to guard the treasure god gave me the revelation you gave me i so appreciate guess what your gifts are arriving we'll be sending them out we're waiting on one more thing to come and we're going to send them out to you but you are precious to my heart i'm so grateful for all of you who support me who who pray for me especially who declare but the best way you can thank me is by taking the revelation and you live it yourself that makes you dangerous against hell and i appreciate all that you say and do on my behalf and on behalf of heaven this is because of father speaking he wants it clear he is not giving his country away he's already touched it and laid his hand on it and you will see the results very soon go host make toast go justice [Music] we will see you later

i do need uh pastors both to come up here i have some mantles to give out both of you if i go there's going to be mantles and he doesn't do you know i can't just say it i have to do it that's the way it is with me so um yeah god has highly honored you and who wouldn't right i mean even a little bit of time i've known you you're passionate you show people and you're hungry and you are so determined and fierce those are the kind of people god needs to do things for him those who want to be quiet and are you know i i hid in the i didn't hide he had me hidden for years but now of course with pink hair you can't hide so be glad he didn't ask you to have it he was going to make sure i couldn't hide and i was known by 40 pastors in our city i did all kinds of things for them my dad did we just love people we didn't care who you were we loved you about we were fierce against the darkness and you are totally fierce against the darkness and i absolutely love the name of your church because i have friends who are some of the hosts and uh you may think that is strange don't think it's strange angels appeared all over the new in the old testament and actually came and ate with uh you know some of the greats of that day but you don't worship them okay it doesn't actually say you can't talk to them if someone if one gives comes to give you a word from god make sure you by the way i have to add this in there always test the spirits there are groups out there teaching you to you know send yourself somewhere and do all kinds of things but you have to test and if an angel appears to you and says come with me you better ask them are you of the spirit of the most high god who sent his son to die for the sins of this world because if they're not they will disappear and they can't answer wrong with that i've done that since i was real little i always would test them even though i go to heaven all the time and i'm around angels all the time they live over my home in my home and if something appears to me though i will still ask them that there is a safety measure that needs to be taught because more and more pastors will find out we are connected in the spirit realm with heaven that's where our rulership is we don't rule over people we rule over all the darkness trying to control people and some some of those beings those demons can appear as angels of light and stuff like that i mean they can they can be very convincing like the left is trying to be right now but anyway just test the spirit so don't reject something i want god wants okay he wants you to know him he wants to know all about him he wants you to understand who you are why he sent you in this particular time on the earth this is a powerful time the divine decade but then also 24 years in the white house god will have total and then after that that 24 years prepares us for the next 100 years if you thought you were leaving you're not going anywhere so don't hide get your crown on roll up your rapture rug you can keep it for later or someone down the road someone generations from now might need that okay and i just need to say this for free the holy spirit say is free the rapture will not be a rescue party it will be a celebration of such glory and power it is a party say it's a party it's not a rescue party it's a party party so uh i i knew what was coming before you invited me because you know he told me and he said you're gonna give out mantels to them they both are going to get mantles for this new season and um that's why when he had me send that word through sunil he said bill bill bill he is serious about the broadcasting i believe you will have a network one day because you already taken authority in that whole system and the frequencies in the in the in the ways that come through to produce that you're already ruling in that and by the way the first thing he wants me to tell you is you have reached the level of king in the spirit realm and uh only god chooses who the kings the lords and the priests are those are spiritual levels of authority that's why he says you are kings and priests and to your god that's not just a title that is a position and i know the church doesn't always talk about that either but i understand it completely what that means so you reach the level of a king in the spirit realm you can't go any higher than that you're not god okay we're lower than him but in the spirit according to dominion and authority a king is as high as you can get and it comes because you fell in love with jesus first you can't skip jesus okay we can't skip the word of god you can't just elevate yourself somewhere i know people have put themselves in the five-fold ministry that never belong there and they can get away with that but you can't get away with saying you're a king because when you declare a decree nothing will happen if you're not but the kings actually have very high rulership and any king even in the natural realm you have an army so does the king in the spirit realm and this day i didn't just come by myself i came with millions of the army of heaven that i i command them get used to that word say we command because he commands god said here you're going to get some revelation on the scripture now when god said command ye me he wasn't saying you tell me what to do he was saying me i want to see you command yes command you me me i want to see you command and that's what he meant we have authority and dominion jesus said i give you power over all the power of the enemy not some of it some of the time all of it all the time but when you rule and take authority over it you're ruling and so the greater you get in those levels of authority you increase in many ways and so we may have had angels helping us in the past but since 2014 a scroll was opened in heaven that had the words on host initiative okay it's that host initiative that's what i'm wearing right here this is their logo they have a logo and it represents the army of heaven working with us but we are not we are over angels right in authority the angels are not over us do you understand that it says in the ages to come we will judge them is that right that means we have seniority because we are we came from the heart of god he made them by speaking but we were birthed from him and so because you've reached that level of king he has sent with me one million of the hosts of heaven that are being positioned here i brought my staff i didn't bring it here with me but i brought my staff to decree for them to be here and so they're actually outside this building right now one million that you will command you will send them you'll give them orders to go and do things in the spirit realm pull down strongholds that you see evil or where wherever evil and wickedness is going on and i mean for instance i take power over all the part of the enemy trying to cheat lie and steal and hide and cover up so i command the host of heaven to go uncover all that that's being hidden no matter where it is how long it's been there or what it is you will go now in jesus name and uncover all of that pull down the strongholds of satan that are helping them empowering them inspiring put down those strongholds that they no longer can assist them in any weightless ever shred platforms the evil high levels of evil and spirit realm are operating in over our country over all the stuff we command the host of heaven now you go and shred those platforms when you do that fear begins to fall on the humans doing the wickedness as long as satan is working with them empowering them and inspiring them they feel bold they feel like they own it but when that is removed they no longer have that this is how you rule the spirit realm that's taking power over all the power of the enemy i'm not controlling people but i'm totally telling through the host of heaven they were made to war for us you don't want the spirit roman battle anything right we are more than conquerors they are a weapon for us weapons are not natural they are spiritual right they are mighty say they it didn't say it in the bible they are mighty to the pulling down the strongholds and one of the ones those weapons is the army of heaven and we get to command them if you're not playing games in the darkness they hearken unto the word of the lord in you so what you say if it doesn't sound like the lord or if you're out there blasting people crushing and hurting people with your mouth or your spouse or whatever you're doing that's not godly they don't have to listen to you so there are requirements okay you've got to have accountability if you have an authority like that you have to god knows he can trust you he trusts them that's what he said to me so this day you are being right now your army outside right now you need to say i choose to invite heaven's army to be my weapon to fight against the darkness i receive them right now [Music] and i i have i have two mantles that came out up here uh this one actually belongs to both of you but this one is just for you [Laughter] i'm going to give brenda hers first isn't it beautiful and so is she to him so chief you're beautiful to the lord and so he wants to bless you with his mantle and it's got many pieces in this mantle it's all the things you'll get to do that you desire to do because you have been willing to do those things that aren't the best that aren't always comfortable there are always uh uh that that maybe other people would not want to do you've been willing to say yes to love people for him to support your husband to love your husband i would say love your husband love your husband you've been willing so he is giving you this is actually a mantle of beauty beauty from heaven and you will get great reward do this so this is yours in this day and i can tell you that we are seated in heavenly places because he takes a layer of our soul that looks just like you the layers in your soul are images of you those are your emotions when you give yourself to jesus christ he has the right to take that and he seats it with him in heavenly places so you are really seated it's not just something suggested it's not symbolic there is a layer of view in heaven looks just like you and at this moment he just put that mantle upon you it is a mantle of greatness greatness love and beauty and so there you go get ready for great things to happen and fun things to happen okay amen and i know this is another mantle [Music] this is a mantle of presidential favor and even though it has trump's name he is president he will sit as president for four more years no matter what anyone else says that is god's plan so he's putting on you not just for this president but for many presidents to come you will have favor from god and they will have your ear to hear god and your hand in friendship so this is a mantle right now of governmental authority presidential favor that's what he called a presidential favor and that includes you and your wife but he wanted me to place it on you as a head come here you just get underneath there too there you go so father right now i i establish and set upon your children the mantle of presidential favor which means they already have favor without measure with you they will have facial favor without measure with the presidents with president trump and with other presidents coming and so long as you have them hear god they will carry and operate in this mantle and they will find out very quickly that is going to begin soon so receive it in jesus name and i bless them god and i thank you for the army of heaven that's been assigned to them father that it will continue to grow the more you send them the more you get them i thank you father in jesus name so be it yes and i have one more gift for you this is a sign of my personal friendship with you i have one i got one for you the same so thank you for being my sister [Music] god bless you god bless you there you go wear it well amen now when i came i already posted a thousand of the hosts of heaven from my own the army that he gave me to command i lost number i don't even know how many there are and we can actually do that today for whoever wants to you have to invite i know this protocol for heaven did you not invite christ into your life is that right i hope you say yes you invite it's the way heaven is you invite christ to come into your life you must invite holy spirit to indwell you is that correct you have to invite heaven to be a weapon for you no they were created for that the army of heaven was never ever designed to protect heaven they don't need it and actually they didn't even get to throw lucifer out and one-third of the angels they didn't get to throw them out they wanted to trust me i don't know what all these people think about this whole thing going on they said there was sadness in heaven they were weeping they were rejoicing they threw a party when they were kicked out god does have a government in heaven and he has a way that he operates that he doesn't abide evil it gets unseated it gets kicked out and that actually did happen in heaven one day and so those angels understand stuff that we're going through right now they understand what we're going through some people have lost family members over this whole thing they really have they've lost businesses and business partners and even churches have split people love churches because they're choosing the wrong thing the wrong thing right you cannot choose or partner with darkness and think you're not going to get some kind of a consequence of that you cannot side with those who want to take the life of people who have no love for anybody that always is a sign that the enemy is involved when life want to be taken or controlled or crushed uh god never put america here actually didn't put anyone here for that reason but america was made specifically by god for his own purposes in his plans his will his way that's why even here in america as we have fought so many times to keep our ability to be free but you don't have the right to hurt crush and bash people and i think the other half the left side doesn't even know what that means they have no lives matter actually is what they ought to be if you want to know the truth no lives matter to them no lives matter to them not even the people they're using matter to them they don't care this is the way the enemy is satan doesn't care who he uses he doesn't care who he destroys he doesn't care who gets stolen from and as i so today i am going to talk about america i can't help that that's god's biggest thing right now with me back in 2015 the beginning god caught me up to heaven and said um trump's going to win and he'll be in the white house for eight years because i need him there even though it might seem impossible it's going to happen he said i'm going to shift america onto my timeline and into righteousness and he said i even have inventions and things to be created that i will not allow to be created until i've dealt with the darkness that's in the government and great exposure to levels people never dreamed of this is still god speaking to me will happen he said it will be great some people will not understand it they'll think i've abandoned them i have not abandoned them i'm actually setting up their lives for the next 100 years [Applause] this country is a light to this world that light will get greater the body of christ will learn how to operate in authority and dominion and it will be so hard for anything like what we are experiencing to ever happen again not until the perilous time is coming nobody knows that day don't plan your life around when the perilous times are don't plan your life around the rapture you have way too much to do we're just beginning to understand the operations of the spirit roman even who we really are we are meant to be in authority in this earth we're not under anything if you belong to jesus christ he's not under anything either on earth as it is in heaven is what god has always desired and yes god does have a dream it is him and mankind operating together as one and so great days have to happen on this earth there has to be those days and everybody thinks well some people think i always get corrected but if i change what i just instantly said the holy spirit just tell me what to say some people think it's the end because things are so awful they're not awful okay i know they may be hard and inconvenient and i know yes people have been affected by this that was not god's plan but there is an enemy in this world and when he can find people who are wicked and evil to do his plan they're going to do it if they've already said yes to him they're going to do it and that can affect our life but in the future it will be much harder because of the discernment we'll be walking in the understanding of who we are living and taking authority uh practically almost everywhere in this world wherever the body of christ lives he actually is going to create regions of light in this country probably the first country because he calls this god called his gift to this world i know his son is but he means literally it is a gift for hope for a future where to find him how to know him how to live free free in order to live free you have to have justice you can't be free without justice so what is god doing today serving out justice [Applause] he said i could not allow trump just to win normally he won oh trust me he won he did win but he said i couldn't let him win the normal way because the darkness would have remained hidden what he's got planned for us is so great and the ability to do things and help people and even change things drastically for the better and the greater would be a better word to use for the greater of god's purposes in this country he had to deal with the darkness that's been hidden for years so he already had a plan it wasn't the scam democrat and it wasn't the pandemic which by the way has been lied about most of the time because god said they'll use anything they can to keep people away from each other keep their mouths muffled and not speak and say anything don't let them gather together because then they'll know truth because they'll be together it's they're too strong together so they came up with a lot of these plans amen [Applause] and all this that was going on god said i haven't changed my plan it's working and he said i will the only one i'll be the only one who gets the glory for all this but of course he wants the glory amen so he already knew this stuff would happen he knew it but we who are the body should always remain strong really strong if you represent christ in this world you represent heaven on earth we represent heaven on earth one day you'll go there if you die y'all stand at me what if you chose you to remain but if you're here for the millennial reign would you want that there will be some that will i'm not planning on dying he won't let me talk about dying he won't let me talk about retiring there is no retirement okay you don't retire in heaven you have a lot of fun and recreation and using your powerful gift that you love whether it's tennis or horseback riding or running a rodeo or a old antique car show or if you're a baker if you're in the theater it's all in heaven it's your gift he put it in you before he sent you here raise up a child in the way in the bent in the gift i gave them to be and they'll never depart from it that's actually what that scripture this revelation it's one of the first things he taught me he said parents that sit there all week long trying to figure out what their child's spiritual gift is is true we'll all sit here and figure out what what is my spiritual gift well in heaven you don't use your spiritual gift people that's why we all think we'll be bored it's the passion he put in you it's what he gave you that you're good at that you think about night and day if you could be paid to do it you do it your whole mansion is being designed around that gift if you were gonna have a rodeo you'd have thousands of horses you have all the property you have real supernatural places for people to come and be a part of that and the horse would be yelling you the whole time oh i'm bucking you [Laughter] it's heaven but right now he wants you here he needs you here he needs you to not just be he doesn't want you just to wake up he wants you to wake up stand up and stand out you need to stand out by the way you live your life the choices you make that you make your stain and you don't back down you do not let fear interfere in your life fear should have no part of you he has not given us a spirit of fear and i know a lot of people think well he didn't send you know spirits of fear no in your spirit man he never put fear that is something that comes from the enemy the enemy brings fear but god didn't give you a spirit of fear he didn't put fear in your spirit man it's not even in you he doesn't send you with it in you you should be free from that he wants you again you know who you are in christ when you become dangerous against hell they don't want to be around you they beg not to be assigned to you do because they know when they go back and they haven't fulfilled their assignment to get you dragged into the darkness they will be beaten satan doesn't reward anybody he does control with fear even in hell so his plan is for us all to be dangerous against then there's no way fear can get in you there's no place for it to even enter in you're so full of him so full of the authority he gave you and the knowledge of him and understanding and having revelation from him revelation on the word revelation is a lifestyle heaven culture isn't just a something it is a lifestyle then you are dangerous and every word that comes out of your mouth will be powerful because it's filled with love with life with hope he said always be ready with an answer yeah the issue is there but the answer is him so how well do you know him if you want to know him more you pursue it amen i was raised as a child one of fifteen i knew it wasn't about me when i was three why because there were others already in the household by the time i was eight i was a mini parent i didn't have anything given to me on a golden platter but i sure was watching those platters 60 loads of laundry a week 50 pounds of potato a week to peel and all those chiefs to watch over because none of them were indians okay none of them don't mean that in the wrong way they were leaders and they knew it that's why he had to give a sear into the household they couldn't get away with nothing i knew what they were doing if i was not even there i wasn't easy to live with i'm still not easy to live with we'll go place oh we need to pray about that okay don't go in there don't sit there cleanse it for the kingdom there are scum on it i don't sit anywhere without going i cleanse it for the kingdom let me never switch mics it's probably my electron whatever oh does it you having a there is an electro energy i can't remember how they tell me i can't wear a watch even in the natural is speeds it does something so god made me before he sent me he sent me as a seer that is god's right but there are people who have that gift that also can the enemy knows if you have that gift by your reactions and how you how you respond and say things about things but so since it was little i could see angels or demons i saw either one and by the time i was like 10 11 12. i knew how the enemy operated i could go tell people don't go there don't do that this is what happens in the spirit when you do that you don't want that to you know and they look at me like i was wild i didn't care he also gave me an attitude of i don't care i don't care what you think it doesn't bother me i am not afraid of the face of man i've seen the face of god and by the way yes you can see the face of god if you receive jesus christ as your savior you think you're going to get holier when you get there you think you have to have a special pass when you die to get into the throne room to see him say no you've been washing the blood of the lamb your name is written in the lamb's book of life he is building your mansion i do love it that he used john the beloved the one who jesus loved i i just john was a showman he really was he was the son of thunder what do you think yeah him and his brother used to fight over pretty girls in the beginning of jesus ministry one day god the father took me back and showed me a day in the life of christ when he was just starting a minister and he had the the rabble i'm talking about the disciples the ones who were with him right and they had left people and they left things that they were doing and luke had patience running down the street asking him why did you leave us for him this is this is a this is him going into minister christ and all these people they were throwing stones at the tax collector because the tax culturals didn't usually go out and mingle they stayed in their little shop okay and you come in paid but when cuz because he was out there he was a target so here's them they're ducking from the stones for him listening to the patients yelling at luke why did you leave him for us and then there's james and john fighting along the side of the road over two pretty girls this is jesus a mighty man sent by god to share the good news and this is who's walking with him and there's the other one with his hand in the money bag all the time and the father said i didn't make it easy for him either because i also am the ce ceo of one quest international i actually do have a position i have a corporation it's called one quest for one god to create heaven on earth to reveal and create heaven on earth and so i do have uh i worked in the business world for 25 years and i loved it then god said okay i'm taking you out of your cushy job i'm taking you out and then i'm going to take your husband out a year later so you're really going to have to love me and believe me we slept on people's floors for a while i still celebrated i didn't change who i was i worshiped i gave i served the whole time we were sleeping on people's floors and people thought we were crazy and my daughter spent their birth each had a birthday sleeping on somebody's floor we ate whatever was there put everything we had in the storage and just trusted god at the end of one year somebody walks up with keys to a million dollar condo at pond division beach and said here you go just stay here long as you want didn't cost us a penny or a dime because we did not change who we were even in the midst of something that people would say it was a disaster my own daughters called it an adventure they belong to me okay we had adventures we never had disasters we never had a crisis it was an adventure you have to live like that so people see you if they don't understand oh no i love him more than anyone else i'm in his hand not some other somebody of the person's hand i trusted him it's a way of life and then i said yes every time he wanted something every time he required something to me i never said never said no to him i'll be almost 70. i forget how old i am it doesn't matter i'm getting younger because i'm claiming timeless you tell me that one day do you want to old do you want to get old well not particularly well then do you want to be timeless i said yes he said whatsoever you say you don't doubt in your heart but believe that it will come to pass you'll have whatever you say so i'm timeless and i have pink hair and god asked me to have the pink hair that really gets some pastors not the black ones oh no girl they like this there's a white woman who preaches and she has a pink hair we gotta have her come that's not what the white one said you are too over threads you have fallen off the edge god would never do that no we can't do that to the people and say your people come to my meetings they will find some way to find me because they want revelation about heaven about god about who they are they're hungry you need to take it up a notch in your church [Applause] it is very true i have like what fifteen thousand black friends i do and they won't let me leave they make me they make me speak four or five hours they don't care if people miss dinner if they miss lunch they don't they don't even care they reset the clock i don't know how many times i went to this one church i went to this really nice church i was invited i went to help rescue this little woman pastor she was gonna get out of the ministry because she was being beat up by other pastors saying she didn't belong there and so i went to this little tiny place outside of washington dc and after three days she was ready to never quit and this other the other they found out about me so they come so i stayed in like this little hotel that had cracks under the door that you know you stuff things underneath it hoping nothing to crawl in that's where i had to stay when i was there and then the other one said oh we found out you're in the area we're going to let you minister and they sent limos and they put me in the wealthiest hotel in washington dc and they had a congregation of 5000 people and i had given all my money to this other little pastor to help her and um and god said he he gets so blessed that my heart is to love that was my my earthly dad heart was to whatever i get i'm giving away that's why i have margaret margaret was created to make money and keep it i was created to give it away so he had to put us both together she's my sister-in-law by the way and she married my brother that took enough bravery right there you ever heard me talk about rj there's margaret she's r.j's wife his solution to all this would just be to kill all the bad people send him to hell then we'll have a nice nice time to that with my brother don't ask him to counsel you if you are in sin he will seriously say that i'll get my gun and we'll deal with it and as you're dying over hell maybe you'll change your mind he really gets invitations from black pastors you're a man you come into my church you didn't know you never know what you're gonna get when i speak okay my life was not very normal but rj is my brother he's my older brother and so he got into all kinds of things he'd he would always ask me because you know he'd say i'm i'm braver than you so you won't do this i i did not not like send dangerous things or dumb things but like you won't stick your finger in this tube because i will and you won't and i did and then the fire pit department had to come cut it off those kind of things were seven eight and nine years old so i went through this whole testing time when my brother too finally went you know i'm not dumb anymore i'm not doing it but r.j usually if there's a killing going on they'll be he'll be there before the police they'll find or he'll find the villain for the police board and he also was in the uh in the military also but he's always been so fierce about un injustice he's friends with all of our police department all of our fire department the military and he's about my size and he's not afraid of anything hell's angels invite him into their to do funerals for them because they'd rather get rid of you to look at you but they know he's a godly man and he's he he's a biker he creates hearties and stuff like that so he's not normal he'll minister to people in nursing homes we're about to go to heaven if you're wicked that person he'll send you either there to the other place and i grew up with him was enough to humble anybody trust me so we have all kinds of a mix in my family then we have all the adopted ones like really adopted and so my dad was creative so we always had fun things to do exciting things to do at home feed the 200 pets we could do a funeral for a pet at the drop of a hat i guess god thought maybe one day we'd actually do real ones i wouldn't do a normal one we'd have cake lined up by the casket they'd have it in heaven right we would have to have music we'd have to have dancing and we'd have to have cake if you want to do it the way they do it in heaven that's how they do it in heaven you go up there you're having a celebration party they have lots of cake everybody dances in the throne and the father greets you he gives you rewards you get to go see your amazing mansion and the whole time we're down here mourning and grieving upset we didn't have enough money to spend on them when they don't need it anymore get cremated it's cheaper the holy spirit told me to say that one time tell me to get cremated it's okay we can put the ashes back together that that's what the holy spirit said so there's a holy spirit quote right there straight from heaven we know where the ashes are okay you can't get clean what if you died in a fire and burn up you don't get your body you're going to get that body back people you better be happy about it it'll look amazing in the bible it says you will be known as you are known you can't be someone else and he doesn't want you to be someone else right now don't let people influence you to be somebody you're not he wanted me up here he picked me out of all the tribe of my family i'm happy that he did and i'm happy he put me in america and i'm happy that our country represents and stands for god one nation under god and and the father would talk to me all the time ever since the elections right before the elections the first time he said i'm going to throw you out there so far you'll never be able to go back like go back where i knew the the media would all act up and you are so right he keeps telling me that they'll lose their many of them are going to lose their networks just so you know that right now and other networks will rise up that will tell the truth amen and they'll give us the true news the right not the hidden the stuff you know not not hiding things but letting us know i travel overseas a lot and during this whole first election that they had i got talked to i mean strangers come up to me and go you must be an american it must be the pink hair and we want to know what you think about your president oh we in america love our president don't watch the fake news whatever you do because they won't tell you the truth about anything and this is even like three years into his term and they went you know what they still they have a problem they can't let go of what they first started with which is the bashing and the accusing they said they don't actually give the news you find out almost nothing about what's important you keep hearing it's like they put it on repeat all the time they're just doing the same thing you know why they've convinced their own soul that stuff is true and when you get in your soul you'll choose again what you choose to do or say you'll choose it again that's what happens that's why people who listen to it have changed people who are nice and kind now are not because they've compromised their soul and so the more people go and say oh no you need to listen to what they're saying they're talking what's right i'm talking about the what the people are saying that haven't made any decisions and there's still some who don't want anybody because they don't like anything they're hearing you choose life you always choose life no matter who you vote for you choose life amen god said this day i offer you life and death what does he say and so they've been hiding so actually their whole mess has gotten worse i'm talking about the news media still out there it's important to know what's going on right we need to know news good news correct news unbiased news and he's going to raise up several people i know for sure several christians that will have their own and first class first-rate network it's nice to have a show it's nice to have a show somewhere but he wants a network that can replace the false networks that are out there and i can tell you right now there is great fear in the camp of the left and there's great fear they may not say it but they're great they're terribly they're awfully afraid some are already hiding they're afraid in the news media they're afraid you may see some people shortly leave their leave leave that to get out before they're taken to prison you cannot commit a federal crime and not go to prison a lot of people in the post office that were paid to change ballots add ballots steal ballots and and that's why i always tell people don't mail it in i always said never mail it in don't mail it in it's too easy for people to take and i know there's two point some million votes that were actually taken away uh and even then you know our president still he still won even that and there were created new ballasts that were fed into the thing when they were supposed to stop counting and close down they weren't and i was watching kenneth copeland also that night i was seeing you and he said okay we're just going to go for the evening and then they announced we're going to stop counting the ballots and the holy spirit said yes that's so they can feed all the false ones in he said this is when they're going to do that this is the holy spirit saying they're going to do the big switch this is on the 3rd of november and they're going to they're going to do corruption and fraud they're going to create brand new ballots and replace the ones that they've even harvested people's names off of ballots and change those ballasts and then put those into the electoral machines that's what they did they caught people in illinois that were throwing trump's ballots by the bins into the river they were up they were arrested in time because of course they were doing it but it was filmed and people saw and they threw them in the river the thing about crime if you're going to do if you're going to do a scam or whatever you want to call it if you're going to commit fraud on a large scale you don't have teams of thousands of people with you so you hire whoever's willing to do it but when you hire these small time criminals guess who's going to yell first they have no bond with those people we are bonded by our love for god and our love for our present we have a bond and the one thing they weren't counting on was that we weren't going to go along with their scam you can't convince people who know the truth to accept fraud you just can't convince them and i mean he had these rallies with forty thousand fifty thousand people in it and i've never seen any would buy these people so where did all these millions of votes come from that he had no people to vote for him i don't know why they don't think well i think they're dumb maybe i don't know they think we are but the one thing they didn't count on was the moral majority in this country the moral majority they don't want socialism they don't want their rights taken away they don't want to be controlled or hand-fed okay they don't want to become a third-world country they have families they have a future they want a destiny for their own children that's the moral majority and a lot of those are believers but some even aren't but they still want that kind of life they're not settling and they could put those million dollar ads on all day long the only ones watching them the ones who made them it isn't changing us and there are people who are blowing whistles even in higher places and they're very much afraid but they can't they can't lose face right now they got to keep their momentum not with us they got to keep their own momentum going for the lie they know they they know they stole it they know they cheated they know that they committed crimes but they can't cave in but there's a lot of ones under them that don't want to take the fall so on november the 4th god had said to me when the ground begins to shake and at this time they were still doing all the false stuff when the ground begins to shake you watch for the landslide the landslide that will go cover from the top to the bottom when a landslide starts it starts with a little shaking and as that momentum builds with that landslide it gets louder and louder and more and more is pulled into that landslide until the whole mountain has been uncovered and god said that will be the crime the corruption all of the stuff the lying the cheating the stealing it will all be made known and even though they won't want to report it can you get over that they won't want to report it they cannot stop president trump from being announced as the president amen he said it will start it will start with one phone call and after that one call is made and known everyone else will be getting in line to rat on that whole group and even though it's happening they well they're it's like i think they're in the fantasy they think if they keep waiting long enough they'll convince us to change our minds and just drop the whole thing now we're not giving our life away we're not giving our destiny away we're not selling our family down the river we are here for the purpose that god put us here for and we are not to be controlled amen and i don't know how long it take to get into their heads the other thing legally in the natural you can't call the presidency until all the votes are counted and i don't know if you know this they're now recounting new york they're even recounting the recounting they're going to get to the thing where they can recount all the states they think that need to be recounted they can't call the election there has been nobody called who has become president the media is just making it up hoping we'll believe it i'm not believing that that's not god's plan and that is not what will happen we don't have to settle in our lives right millions of people i want you know this have prayed around the world who aren't even americans [Applause] because they don't want america to become a third-world country we stand for justice liberty and freedom and we help many other countries and have and still will they don't want to see us they don't want to see us fail and even they don't believe the lie and they don't even live here just with statistics and proof it's called proof people even with the proof that all these millions of people are following and supporting trump they still had a plan they already planned this they had this plan before he even started running again they knew how they would steal it they knew that they could do it they knew there was a way to do it they knew they could pull it off they knew if the media would be on their side that that's all what everybody would believe but they didn't and so i wanna i wanna encourage people don't talk about losing you don't talk about losing when god is still working his plan why we have already won we have already won we won because we voted we won because we prayed we won because it was god's plan and all that is needed in the natural realm has already happened for president trump to keep his seat amen and and god a god god who knows everything of course he told me because i'll just be walking around all of a sudden he'll just start talking to me when i say god i mean the father yes i hear jesus all the time people find the craziest things to say about you one thing you don't even know jesus you don't mention him oh yes he is my first love and i talk about him all the time you must not be listening to the right videos i have nothing without him i am nothing without him i'd have no future i would have nothing but i do have him and i know him well i know what happened to him on the cross i know what happened to him in the garden i know what happened to him in hell i know what happened to him when he went back to heaven and poured out his blood on the mercy seat i know what was happening in hell when he was pouring his blood out in the mercy seat the loser was in hell groveling in the dirt of hell stripped of all his gemstones broken and beaten by the son of god and no longer had the keys to hell death and the grave so he took his beauty and he took his authority away from him that gave us absolutely the right to operate in authority in this world satan is a false king he's not even a king he's a false prince a false one who never was given authority or the right to do anything he took what he wanted and used it while he can and that side no matter what name you give them that does the same thing as all the same thing is always what satan wants he wants it his own way he wants people to worship him he wants him to only exist with him and that's what happens no matter what you put name or tag you put on that that is satan's plan is to kill steal and destroy every person and everything that's why he is afraid of america satan hates america because it causes them more problems than any other country because we preach the gospel from here we train people and send them with the gospel we go over there and help people learn how to give the gospel we feed people everywhere we're doing kind acts we care about people we rescue people for him if you were the enemy you wouldn't want any of that so what is your plan i'm going to take over i will deceive them this thing's going to stop i can't take it anymore it's not working with my plan i'm going to take over this country i'm taking it for myself there's enough wicked people here i can already get to use to do that but what he didn't count on was we have the truth living in us it's not something we hear is something that lives with us and the one who brings the truth lives in us why would he think we would believe a lie [Applause] you need help if you want to believe a lie we'll have deliverance right now you walk in the truth you live the truth you breathe it you speak it he came to set us free [Applause] justice is on one of the steps of his throne huge words justice yes he wants justice yes he wants accountability yes he wants people to pay for the things they have done wrong but those who are at the top that lead others into it are in even more trouble with god when you deceive others to join you and twist the truth and ruin their future and ruin their destiny and so many have been brought into that place right now and i always encourage them if you're listening go tell the truth while you still can go repent and they'll cur turn them in tell the truth about the crimes that were committed and i have sent the host on a daily basis to encourage people who committed those crimes to tell the truth do it now while you can don't wait till it's too late you'll go to prison you know satan tells people things all the time do you know the spirit of god does too he can speak to people to inspire them to encourage them and heaven wants us to remain free because he has god has a plan i'm telling you for 24 years in the white house he's not willing to tell trump oh you can wait four years and then i'll put you in then can you imagine the one who made everything holds the air you breathe no has been from the beginning then they've been could you ever see him oh i guess i'll have to change my plan we don't understand his ways but we need to everything that's happening is to set us up for the next 100 years the inventions that are waiting they're just beyond your imagination that god's gonna send to this earth to help people and make their life better cancer will be here no more i really believe they already have a cure they just don't want you to know it there'll come a time as this administration trumps administration and then pence is after that for eight years and then i i live prophecy i live it and he doesn't just show me a few years i clearly know what will happen for the next 50 years clearly have seen it and been there god's not changing his mind in his master plan for america he needs who he chose in that office when he chose him to be there and he is not willing to let the enemy have those times some of the greatest leaders in the body of christ are still being born who is throwing mountains into the sea who's walking on air are raising the dead that were cremated who's stopping an earthquake and make it go back the way it was before it came including the dead being raised and the buildings going back together that's the greater works why would he all of a sudden decide i just don't want this his son died so he could have that happen the death of his son and resurrection of his son was so these things could happen in this world that he created so they could happen and people would know there is a god he told me he was erasing the gray area that existed in america what's the gray area the one saying there is no god that is getting smaller and smaller there come a point where people know i'm either in the darkness or i'm in the light there's there's no hiding there's no wondering you know who people believe and what they live they'll either live in regions of darkness and it will be legal and they'll be living in regions of light the great light the greater light regions and cities sometimes more than one city and people will drive their dead family members in there and they'll come to life that's how powerful the presence of god will be the authority of the believer will be great in these regions of light sickness can't abide no crime i saw demons flee like dust out of these cities to get out because it was painful for them the annoying king that was put in you when you were born again is painful to the enemy what anointing the anointing that breaks the yoke you have it first john 2 27 there's a scripture for all you who want that it's in the bible i have a little cd i made and we made it in this very old church because the pastor thomas he gave himself up and ran from a denominational church they tried to steal his church in mississippi in the heart of mississippi in this little tiny town it says little town where big things happen and it's one little pastor stood up to all the other religious people trying to shut him up and didn't want him speaking about certain things and so finally they said in in two weeks you'll be out of here and he stood up in the church and he was the pastor and he said okay i'm leaving now whoever would like to follow me and have life and have holy spirit just come they all left with him i think he had four elders left and he started this church it was never got really huge but man the impact it had on that whole little town and he found out about me i think i went to his place like eight times in like two years and they ended up by getting people together and they trained them and trained them in the host and they ran witchcraft out of town they ran it out i mean you talk about manifestations they they had them everybody was afraid of the witches and uh god said when you go this time witchcraft will be run out they will run it out and when we were leaving down when margaret and i were leaving we had pictures in the sky of a witch leaving town leaving town those people are so determined we want to be free from the effect and the control witchcraft is not a joke don't watch it don't watch it don't read it it's all about controlling people that's what they're for it's not a joke one of the things coming one day because you know whenever god does some great things the enemy brings in a counterfeit right well people will begin to know okay well i can't believe this lie anymore it's too obvious that god is here it's going to get more and more obvious that there is a god his name is jesus christ and so it will be hard for the devil to come up with new things but one of the things he will have at that time will be good witchcraft because all the movies are preparing people for him oh in front of people they'll raise the dead and heal the sick and say you can still be a witch see this thing is coming we have to be powerful we have to be strong we have to be fierce we have to understand uh it says in all your getting of wisdom get understanding that is knowledge of the holy one and how he operates that's why these days have to come they have to have manifestations of the power and the passion and the plans of the living god because that is the one thing we can come against it with because there will be a lot of impressionable people think oh this is a good thing they have not one ounce of discernment in their being because they've been fed it by movies and books oh there are good witches they're against the bad ones there are no good witches and they've been around for a long time and the bible says have nothing to do with a necromancer go look it up there were never any good ones in the old testament there were never any good ones in the new testament and there are no good ones now don't consult a medium or a psychic you're getting this for free don't consult them if you did lose it from your song repent for it they don't work for god he's fivefold ministry his prophets or prophetic people anyone can prophesy make sure you're accountable in your life and your actions right and you know how you get more you step out and do it you step out god gives you word if he's like you're going to explode and burn inside you need to say that you're also not accountable for forcing that person to do it i'll save you some grief if you deliver a word from god it's not your job to make them do it you're going to start a whole different war you deliver it let the holy spirit work on them not your job and the hardest people to prophesy to are your family my family still wants to know what's for dinner when laundry's gonna be done even though they have they have all this revelation he knows how to keep you humble give your family [Laughter] and even if i go too long let me know i just gotta talk about jesus bless the lord jesus christ and all that he's done more than any of us all put together he's been through it all he really has the hardest part was the garden not the cross he died before he got there he died to the father's will if it be possible let this cup pass from me because what was in the cup wasn't in him it wasn't anything he ever would do or want to do but what had to be nailed to the cross was what was in the cup that's the only person who can forgive our sins is him he's the only one that drank all that sin in and nailed it to the cross no one else can say they can forgive sins no other religion no other god none of them in the garden was the most important thing he did when he said but not my will let your will be done and two angels were sent from heaven i got to talk about this cup when jesus when he was on the earth and it would say even when he had his disciples especially after he got the disciples he'd go away to the mountain to be with his father he'd go see him he'd meet him and talk to him and he went there and he took him a cup god his father made him a carpenter he put business in his son so he would have a door to speak to anybody anywhere that's why he likes business people you get more invitations if your business right and so i also opened a door for him to talk with sinners all the time they wanted him to do he was a master carpenter not just a finish not just a little finish she was a master carpenter joseph was a master carpenter so he made on purpose for his father he made this cup it wasn't really beautiful it was wood of course very perfect mastery the way he made it in the handle was beautiful and so he met with him and gave it to him this is about his um second year into his ministry so when the father had to choose he already knew this would all happen he had to choose a cup to put all that in and he knew his son would have to drink it or the plan wouldn't work the plan was to for him to die for our sins that we might be free that we would have a way back to the father so the father got that cup and he put all that stuff in it he chose two angels from a gabriel's group because gabriel angels look more like humans with wings most of the army look like creatures i mean some have eight eyes some have weapons coming out of them they're an army so he picked two of gabriel's that already the lord knew who these angels were he knew them he knew them when he was in heaven and they brought that cup to him and they were in the garden the whole time and ministered to him while he was having to drink this cup but as part of their reward god does reward as part of the reward for willing to do that it would be very hard because they couldn't come against anybody there who was coming to take him the army actually probably had the hardest time because he was the lord of hosts the army of heaven he was over all the armies of heaven christ was and and they loved him and so it was probably very hard they were all told in heaven this was going to happen they knew it so they didn't come down and beat up people or rip up the people that were going to try to crucify him i'm sure they wanted to do that because to defend to protect him would have been their number one thing when christ came and was sent down to earth and made into a little seed and planted in the womb of mary they already knew they couldn't go down there and fight for him if you remember what he said before the sanhedrin court if i wanted to do you remember he said that if i wanted to he was letting them know i'm not i'm not who you really think i am i have the ability to do these things i lay down my life but if i wanted to i could call the army of heaven these creatures are like 150 200 feet high they have eyes where you wouldn't even think guys would be they have spears coming out that shred the enemy when they spin the the in satan's army they they have all kinds of weapons they turn into missiles and go to where the battle is and they come back to be their self and then they go in there and attack he could have called them to fight for him if he had said even one word they would have come but he knew he had to die so these two angels were in the garden with him their reward was they also were chosen to be in the tomb with him and they were the first ones to see him when he came back up from health i was recently in israel they're still outside the tomb they still protect it's a holy place they're still there they're on assignment they were the first ones who got to see him they're also the ones that talked to the disciples they talked to mary and they said why are you looking for the why are you looking for him he's not dead those two same angels were the ones who were in the garden with him with a cup so god does give rewards angels get rewards for completing what they were sent for now in this time they are millions of them have been sent to fight on our behalf we have the right to command them because they were made like a military and you can't go to an army a natural army and say would you mind please going over here and doing that could you imagine standing before hope or gay going to ship them out somewhere would you mind would it bother you uh please i have a request would you mind going over that they would look at you like you were nuts the army of heaven is the same way they need orders from headquarters well headquarters is here because the lord of hosts lives in us and they have been very very busy over these last few months and even more so now to make sure every single thing gets exposed they know where everything is nothing is hidden from god he knows where every stolen ballot is he knows where every every machine it was messed with or tampered with or changed or whatever he knows the name of every person who participated he is not clueless and he meant it when he said the exposure will be great so he said i said well what do you want me to do now i mean i i pray every night i'm not i call it prayer communication i talk to god if i have a request i spend another time just getting to know him i would just spend time talking to him like he was right here because he is and one day he walked through the wall of my home now he walks through the wall of my home all the time but they need you need to give them commands they can't take a written prayer request okay they can't do that back in the day even in the old testament i think it's in isaiah it said that the israel was under a siege for something i remember what it was and it said the captain of the host that's michael went to the far ends of heaven and gathered the army of heaven to come and fight on behalf of israel so that's the way it normally was done until 2014 there was already a major shift into our authority and dominion and i can tell you this the army of heaven cannot they cannot finish the whole purpose he made them if we do not do this they were always designed to fight for us amen i just want to assure you that trump i hear my in my ears all the time trump's winning trump's winning he's sitting in the white house he's going to sit in that white house he's not going to be evicted he will sit there and you'll begin even more and more to see him bring pension on different things because he'll be preparing him he will be preparing him to be president after him how do i know god said so i say what god says and i show you things that he showed me and he will sit in that white house and to me it doesn't matter what date they give that it is happening it's happening i've even already received a request to come and do um to pray for the president vice president at the inaugural prayer breakfast because guess what they're carrying on with their plans too [Applause] they're preparing like none of this ever happened they're already scheduling events for the inauguration making plans hiring companies to do things because they know the truth is everybody stand up for just a minute you don't have to wonder if you've ever been chosen if you're alive this is what caused it if you're alive and breathing you're chosen if you remember the body of christ you have greatness written all over you god's plans have already been written about you and god said these days that we're living now will be sung about in heaven in eternity this so this is not just another time on the earth this is an event on god's timeline it doesn't count time like we do it's all about events and this is an event in heaven part of the divine decade that we'll be living in and the things you'll get to do people have never even seen or heard of on the earth before because you're chosen nobody can tell you you're not i'm telling you you are chosen how do i know you're here if he times your birth on the earth and you are here you are chosen chosen to be great for him chosen to manifest the power of the living god it is a great thing to be a manifested son or daughter he trusts you you don't have to have a real high education it's not about how smart you are it's about how willing pray that my people be willing in the day of my power those who are willing and obedient shall eat the fat of the i know the word i don't carry a bible it's in here we were taught to read the word of god and know the word of god we were taught to pray before we could even speak we had family altar but it didn't make me not want god it made me want him more he loves every person in every country no matter where they are right now no matter who they are no matter what they're doing he still wants them so if he doesn't have us if he doesn't have the light in the spirit realm you have light coming from you some people have great light some people have light some people have darkness in them [Music] so i always know who knows the lord and he doesn't know the lord if there's any way possible now these people have to shake their hand they don't know they don't want me hugging well some might want to hang them it's so important to learn to release the anointing if you don't if you don't do that why did he put it in you to release it [Music] you only got to deposit [Music] it says in first john 2 27 when you receive jesus christ as your savior you receive a deposit of the anointing what anointing the anointing breaks the yoke that's what it is the more you release it the more it grows that was not peter's personal shadow that healed people it was the cloud of anointing because he released so much it builds a cloud sometimes you can walk in the room and it fills the whole room that's any believer any believer you have it in you it's a deposit so the more you give it out the more you get back and it never stops it just grows and grows and one day you feel yourself when you go i release the anointing you actually feel it it looks like blue fire shooting out of you so everybody put your hand here we're gonna stir it up say father i choose as an act of my will as a believer in jesus christ to release the anointing so stir it up okay now i want you to lay hands on somebody next to you and i want you to say with everything within you and you say this and you wait until i say i can feel i can feel leaving you i want you to open your hand the person say i release the anointing in jesus name i want you to see i can already feel it i want you to picture it leaving right here and it goes up your arm like blue fire written out of your arm so if i walk here like i can feel it coming from all of you it's like up here it swirls like a river the fire does everywhere i've been i feel it like waves hitting me right now it's very powerful i want you to say thank you jesus for giving me the anointing encourage me every day to use it wherever i go amen okay y'all stop [Music] [Applause] when i sit in a restaurant i always put my hand on the table and just say i release the anointing and i will see blue fire come out of my hand and coat that whole table it will never wash off it will never wear off whoever sits at that table will get the anointing on them i do the same thing to the glasses to the silverware when you go through a door if you touch the door release the anointing when you slide your card release the anointing everyone who slides their card in that thing will get the anointing on them before you send a text get it typed out let your hand say release the anointing when they open it the anointing will get on them [Music] it is transferable there's no excuse not to do it it is free you will begin really i'm not kidding you'll sit in the seat and get up and someone sits and they'll feel the anointing i can sit and people people's seats like when we used to do i used to do hospitality of our church of 5000. we would do the feed the board every once a year it would be like jesse and all kinds i can't remember other names right now but powerful men and women of god and they get up and leave i wouldn't be in there when they were eating i go sit in everybody's chair i knew who it was i always knew jesse i'd start laughing whoever was i i could feel it it's like light electricity on you if you want to have encounters if you want to feel the power of god it is in you it's already in you when you got saved he put it there you release it you can put on clothing like i prayed over their mantles like i release the anointing every chair in your office including your desk now has the anointing in it it doesn't matter where you go the more you do it the more will come out and you do that one day you'll be shocked and you'll feel it leaving you so when peter would walk past people we did it so much the cloud of the anointing like far exceeded him and when they said his shadow touched him they were healed and demons came out it was the anointing that breaks the yoke that you have don't ever forget this you have a weapon from heaven that breaks the yoke of darkness put in every gift you give every gift you give release into the gift if you give something away people release it if you give food to people release it don't ever stop doing that one day you walk into a place and people will fall out from the anointing the glory you create glory for god but you also carry the glory how do i know christ in you do you know what that means that's something that's deposited in you too the glory at one point will begin to be released from you it looks like it looks like shock waves of light the glory looks like light the fire looks like fire it feels like i when i see people release it it like shock waves i can almost hear it and it was somewhere speaking somewhere and the holy spirit said go back to the products table and as i started walk through the proxy table people started falling out now i talked about the glory in the meaning guess what it also makes a difference because of your soul that when you speak about these things it increases in your soul you can't hear something and then do nothing you can't do it heaven doesn't operate that way it's your actions along with your words if you want to rule you have to do something who cares what people think so i went to the broader table these people started falling out and i'm like i could feel like wow i could hardly i could hardly stand up on wow god they're really anointed aren't they i heard the holy spirit he laughs at me a lot he was laughing and laughing goes that is coming from you because i was looking no matter what these people are falling down they're lining people waiting to get products and my son-in-law who's my son-in-law just kept right on selling the products i'll always decide now just do this it was funny because okay okay what do i do you said just say already used to glory and i literally could see light waves go like shhh and whoever they touched they started falling down people got healed people got set free and went what is this when the bible goes the knowledge of the glory will cover the earth life the waters cover the sea he said it will cover them because you will be releasing it people will be this not just me this is for the body of christ christ in you is the hope of glory the glory being released showing up impacting people and nations and things and places that god wants you to go to this is what you get as a believer do it in your family's home how do you do that you just start doing it i release the glory i release the glory i release the glory just take time to do it pretty soon you can do that one day and you'll feel it coming out of you if you speak for christ if you share with people if you read your word it's building in you let it out let the anointing out let the glory out fire when the baptism in fire comes it's going to be so powerful it just burns the world out of you it burns any fear you'll never be afraid again the boldness that rises up in you you begin to carry that fire places will actually look like they're on fire buildings look like they're on fire people will see it on you one day his eyes were flames of fire our god is a consuming fire that is spiritual fire that will transform you and places and people because you carry it

by Sermon For You Apr 20, 2021

or https://youtu.be/KKsMrCIJDRw
yes we are on right now i believe so hello everybody again it's always worth waiting for something from god isn't it and you know we all need extra grace here too sometimes but i don't know how much you heard or i don't know but we're going to start all over again so thank you for joining us i'm very excited that i get to share um revelation from heaven you're going to get news bulletins from heaven during this time you may even get something brand new given to me and if it comes from heaven i'm going to share it but this is the very main purpose for these this broadcast today is to share what time it actually is on god's timeline and many people don't know god has a timeline of course he does he created time and there are certain things he will make sure happen in this earth he made the earth he made us he put us here for a purpose and so guess what he has worked out this whole timeline thing even to the very end which by the way no matter what people say or think or try to calculate or assume only one person knows when the end will actually come that would be the father so even jesus knows that right so we're going to flow with what the father has figured out for this time and he does have a plan even while you're taking a unexpected vacay at home and i'm praying all the time for people you know and in their situations and how this is going to affect them in many different ways i have been outside at night in the street probably for hours praying over all of you and i want to say hi to my friends that would be my pastor friends who've invited me to come and share their place to bring heaven to this earth i'm excited that some of you actually get to see this broadcast and from now on as much as we can we're going to give you all a heads up if you would like to before we go live and then i'm very happy to be with all of you today and very grateful for all that you have done and paid a price for yourself to allow god to invade and inhabit your sanctuaries in your meeting places because you want the more of god and i hope everyone out there you have had an opportunity to be a part of meetings that give you revelation that train you that they don't just give you a nice little message that makes you feel warm and fuzzy but will make you powerful and dangerous against the darkness that's why we are here it's the body of christ that is the audience i'm speaking to right now to those who have been born again who've received jesus christ as your savior those are the ones i'm speaking to anyone else listening you're just going to get blessed anyway and by the way i need to let you know that my words carry the anointing that abides in me the anointing that breaks the yoke of darkness so if you're out there for other purposes or uh you have an agenda of your own zap bam you with the anointing so that when you leave this broadcast no matter what you thought you came here for you will be filled with the anointing aren't you excited about that we need to learn about these weapons god has given us like the anointing i may share a little bit about that later by the way this is not the only broadcast that we'll be making during our little vacay at home stay whatever we want to call that i don't like the word quarantine we don't actually have anything ourself right now and let me tell you we you will learn how to come against every spirit of infirmity sickness or disease before we end because most of the questions i get from people are what do we do about this can we do anything about this you know we're not over sickness what can we do well they obviously don't read the word of god because jesus said the things that he did we will do also in greater works and he was over sickness he was not under it you are over it you are not under it you need to start saying that yourself don't repeat every every doom and gloom thing you hear about today or you know this is the end we need to get ready to escape on the rapture rug i can tell you also this is not time for your rapture rug roll it up and stick it in the closet and as you've heard me say before get your crown on because the word itself says that we are kings and priests and to our god those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion that is something powerful christ gave us you need to learn to rule even in this time even while you're at home or wherever you are right now you know that you can speak words of authority and dominion and take that authority and it starts to change things number one open your front door if there's a lot of arguing going on if there's strife in your home right now open your front door and you evict it out right now you don't want to keep that stuff in your home make sure you're speaking words of hope and life and truth to all of your family and even to yourself so these are just little tips maybe the holy spirit may add throughout this broadcast because he really is the director no matter who we think we are what we're doing the holy spirit is the director of all these broadcasts if he wants something sad that's not on my little tiny tip list here then he's going to say it to me and if he says it you're going to hear it that's one of those news news bulletins from heaven but our primary purpose today is to discuss what time it is on god's timeline so that you be prepared for the future and by the way the main thing he wants me to say to you is this is a temporary situation some people act like it is the end of their life and it's not this is only temporary it will pass like many things that come and go on this earth this too will pass and hopefully you will be stronger and better and more understanding of god himself and be able to ruin reign in your own home learn how to crush the darkness and push it back so you will be stronger yourself and i want to also just add this i have called many different places where i do business with or a frequent and most of them have left the nicest kindest and encouraging messages on their answer machine for everyone to hear when you call just as an example i had to call steinmart because i have to know if i can still come in and make my little payment and guess what they said they said this is just a temporary setback we will be back and when we come back we'll be stronger we can't wait to see you again that should be your attitude not like it's all over oh god what are we gonna do now do we need to take all of our money out of the bank and go hide somewhere in the hills with it number one you can't spend it in the hills and number two i would not do that unless god told you to you're gonna need that bank account you're going to need it to still thrive and not just survive on this surge you're going to need a place to keep your money send your money and spend it and so unless he told you that don't run to the bank and drain your bank account and close everything he'll just be going back and reopening it later this is a temporary situation and i do take everything seriously people said you should be serious about this is really a desperate time i would not call this a desperate time i would call this god's time and i'm going to go along with what god says and what god wants and i'm going to keep my attitude excited and expectant because that's what you should be if you belong to him he knows where you are he knows every hair on your head he knows every day of your life he knows the day your mansion and your mention in heaven will be done he's already planned your homecoming so why not stay excited in your life and you choose to be happy instead of mad angry upset don't let that get into you and whatever you do you need to crush fear don't let fear rule you no fear no interfering of fear in your life and why i keep saying that because a lot of people are also i get listen i get text messages from people who actually have my number i get emails from all over the world i get phone messages left on our phones which we have obviously on our website that anybody can call us that wants to and so after listening to these or looking at these over these last few days i understand that people are in fear they're confused they're in fear maybe they've never faced anything like this before my mom would be sitting right here with her plum switch next to me saying hey they survived the depression this is not the depression it is not a plague and it isn't a disease it is a virus a virus comes and goes it also has a time limit and why have we chosen the symbol for our theme that says god's time and it shows an hourglass like an actual hourglass because the sands of time in an hourglass have a limit and when those sands pass through the hourglass that time is over well that's exactly how we see this whole situation it is a temporary time it is a limited time in your life and i look at this times break in time or moment in time that we're in right now is very special that means i get to spend more private time with god i actually will get to spend time with my family now that's exciting for me since i do so much traveling and i do a lot of broadcast i do a lot of other things that takes up the time on the earth in my life so i'm in one in one way i'm very grateful and thankful that i actually get to spend time with my family or maybe even call the family members i haven't seen in a while i hope you're going to take advantage of that maybe even make a few notes of wow i can spend time doing this instead of just being a fearful or upset or confused get rid of all those things in your life right now and fill yourself with the life of god the plans of god his expectancy you can choose with your own will to take this in one direction or another i hope you take it in one that takes you up and not down in this time god has planned on the earth he's not changing anything it's not going to change his plans or what he's going to do just because a virus is passing through and hopefully will pass out that would be i say rather than passing the virus just pass out and i want to also repeat something you're going to things i've heard god say to me and he this is what he says about this whole thing this is not a government takeover but it is a takedown of the virus so doesn't that sound much better than people yelling the the government's taking over they're going to take everything away we're going to have marshall uh law is going to come in and we're going to be be putting body bags and ships somewhere yes we've heard all these things given to us that is not what god's got planned and don't let your mind go in that direction okay we need to all be in agreement with what has been decided on for our best our government that is in place right now number one god chose our leader he's a powerful man he does love america and he's doing his very best to handle this in the best way and to think that anybody would even consider that possibly the country would work together to try to limit the spread of this uh virus and really care about us and he is talking about financial help i am not um crazy enough to think that that doesn't interfere in your life i understand we have to have money to buy things and to get supplies that we need and my prayer for all of you out there is that god will so inspire you feel you so full of him make sure you think about others other than just yourself because i know right now some people are kind of isolated with themselves but you do remember that all the people in this country are also experiencing the same thing at the same time which is rare okay there's people in other countries and many of them are my friends and i want to say hello to everybody out there who's not in america yes god cares about you too make sure you're speaking life and hope and the power of god and everything you say if people ask you questions about this going on say we hope in our god we trust in our god our god knows and he cares about us and he cares about people other people too so the way you think and the what you say makes a huge difference in the atmosphere of where you live this place i live in right here i call it my dwelling place because it's not a home it's my office this whole entire structure we used to call a home is now our office and i mean it's our studios it's our shipping receiving department it's a duplicating place and we have learned to adapt to that but god has a plan even in doing this this wasn't something negative he planned for us we had to adapt our own lives we do know at one point in our life we will get another home and i will so enjoy that personal space and private place but right now we're giving this place almost to the whole world so you will know who he is why he sent you to this earth what his plans are for you and we on purpose on the hourglass took the h off of the word it's not hourglass h-o-u-r o-u-r it's o-u-r it's our time with god's time it's us doing something together and one of the other things that we'll be talking about maybe not tonight are the keys to the kingdom and they they are so powerfully amazing christ gave us so many things to live with to make our life better if we apply it and that's another major thing for you when you get revelation from god it is not ever something just to hear it's something to live by and there are tips on how we can do that in the earth and make sure no matter what every day when you get up you ask for grace for abundant life it's free it's from god it will fill you with fuel from heaven so i'm going to encourage everybody out there listening let's just do this together right now because like i said i'm here to explain and train so i'm going to train anyone out there if you've not learned about asking for grace for abundant life there's two graces one is grace for eternal life that christ brings us the other one is grace for abundant life that even christ operated in it says in the word that as a child god this is the father filled his son with his grace that was grace for abundant life it's one of the reasons why christ was able to be happy and successful uh living downhill with mankind when he used to live in heaven with his father and then all of a sudden here he is on the earth walking just like you and i facing everything we did but he didn't sin how about that so don't let people tell you you cannot live sin free yes you can you choose but in this time we're going to ask for lord anybody hold your hands out if you're watching right now and repeat these words father i ask for and receive grace for this day for abundant life amen now i can tell you right now i feel it coming into me it's like a shower of a light electricity because i am a seer and uh you know i am a revelator i experience the things that go on in the spirit realm and that was fuel from heaven being poured into me that i will need for this day and if you get that every day of your life before you get out of your bed it won't always be your selfish self showing up it'll be heaven showing up you'd be surprised that just as few words that you've asked for and received will help to change what's in your soul and joy will flood your soul expectancy hope will flood your soul and then you'll be coming out ready for that day and so i hope of all of you who did that you don't never forget that it'll be one of the greatest things that i ever train you in is is called heaven protocol for heaven culture because i've been having many times no one up there is upset or angry or offended nobody's confused nobody losing deception there's no worry there's no anger or wrath up there they live in that abundant life grace so when you ask for you get filled with that it changed me from the first time the father taught me how to do that it changed me it was so important to him that he literally caught me up to heaven before his very throne and taught me that like i was eight years old most of the things god has in his word for us are simple but we in our human mind feel like we have to understand every single thing we reason it out we don't step forward in faith we use reason instead of faith faith is what draws heaven jesus said himself when i do return to the earth will i find faith he didn't say will i find divine wealth will i find uh you know will i find people laughing and celebrating what will i find so one thing he wants to know is will he find faith faith is something that creates for you is something that you can live with and live in every day of your life it is a source that you will even use when you get to heaven okay you get trained to do things in heaven also i won't even share some of those right now because that's going to be our next broadcast but you know what faith is more important than the food you eat or the air you breathe is faith it comes from heaven god fills you with it the more you operate in it it grows until you become very powerful in the spirit and it's hard for the enemy to deceive you these are simple basic truths in the word of god and people always tell me well not always some people say you don't even have a bible it's in here and it's very much alive i was raised by my earthly father who helped to take care of 15 of us how would you like that living here in florida we're in florida i love florida it doesn't snow you know we were from upstate new york we got frozen all the time we were the chosen frozen back then but now we're not and so you need to learn the important things in your life right now i know you say well we need a house to live and of course you do we need food to eat yes and here to breathe but even more important than those you need faith in god you need to be trusting him not just when things are going well but in the other times when things are maybe a little bit challenging or you're struggling with things even if it's something that's not good in your life you're struggling with it god still loves you he wants you to step out and use the faith everybody got a measure of faith the bible says some you need to learn to operate in it so it will grow and it will become productive and it will change the way you live your life in this day you're not supposed to be living in doom and gloom or hopelessness you are supposed to shine like the stars in the heavens by the way we are over those stars we're not even under those stars all that god made whether here or throughout the cosmos he made that for us we are his offspring he is our real father we came from him you need to know about your dna you need to know about the generations that went before you you need to know about the generations that god even had in heaven the ages that have passed down the earth that you don't even know anything about god holds that in his hand if he wanted to right now he could sit in heaven and hold the entire earth in his hand or he could become small enough to step inside you that's who he is he knows everything everything that was that is or ever will be that's who you are trusting right now with your life in the midst of these challenging times you need to trust him and make sure you say that he loves to hear you say i trust you god i trust your father even when i don't understand i am trusting you i will serve no other god there will be no other god before me and make sure by the way you say that to satan he hates to hear that by the way it makes him tremble in these days these few weeks we have of being with our family and being with god make sure you're productive in them make sure you take full advantage of them do fun things with your family create and to be very creative and inventive and adventurous in this time with them so they get hope built in them and not fear what you say what you say with your mouth right now is very important don't declare the doom and gloom don't declare the time has come where everything's going to end when god just brought you some of you have brand new babies in your life right now and children young children did you know he has generations of time planned for them too don't make a decision in your head that it's all over because then you'll be running and hiding you might miss something god has for you these are great opportune times for god to bring something new into your life new jobs new homes new positions do you know that's how he looks at it we need to all be in agreement for him to do what he wants how about if we say god we want your will your way you all know that scripture that talks about on earth as it is in heaven that is his desire for all of us and i know some of the prophets even pastors and leaders if they don't know what time it is you know what they do they go to the end of the bible and they start speaking about the end leaving out generations of time for things that god has planned that hasn't even happened yet on the earth some of the best times have not even happened yet i want to encourage you to seek god on your own get the word and stop reading it there's even scripture in the word that says jesus himself said even though that nation will rise against nation there'll be wars rumors of wars nations will rise against nation kingdoms shall rise against kingdom guess what he says at the end of that but the end is not yet so i will tell you from heaven from god himself the end is not yet so roll up your precious rapture rug and stick it in your closet and maybe get one that says this is god's time and then live by that time yes i know things are different in your life i know that they've said you can't go to church you can't do this nobody likes the word can't but you know they actually have a reason for doing that like i said just a few minutes ago this is not a this is not a government takeover this is a takedown of the virus their purpose is to try to limit the contact between people so that anyone who has that will not be able to spread it they're trying to limit the spread of the virus and you know even it has a time it has a very limited time that it even remains in your body it's a virus remember it's not a disease it's not a plague i think hell's about to experience a plague though it's called the faith of god in his people that's like a plague to them they don't like it they don't want to hear that and uh so we're going to make a lot of hell unhappy a lot of hell's army is going to be very unhappy because we'll be operating with heaven's army by the way they do exist also maybe we should take take seriously the things that god said in his word it is uh is a platform for life and how to live it it even has a time frame in itself but i can tell you you are not in the end day these are powerful days start thanking god for the things that you desire in your life get your children teach them how to ask for that grace do you know i have grandchildren that learned it when they were not even two years old yet and now that they're six and seven and eight if they start to have a meltdown do you know what they do they reach up and they say father i ask for more grace and their meltdown stops you know how this could change the way your children grow and live themselves this is a powerful time to get to teach them revelation that will even inform their whole life their lifestyle and how they live don't run into the darkness don't satisfy yourself with that i know they're even saying you know your entertainment can't take place why not entertain yourselves for a while i want to actually sit down and have conversations with each other i know there's still television out there and there's not much on that eye there is there i am grateful to god that he is taking hollywood which is one of the things he's had me talk about what does that mean that means he's taking that throne away from satan see he's got plans you maybe don't even know about he has big plans for this time god's time he calls it the kingdom age we're in a new season in this kingdom age there was the introduction of the kingdom age and we stepped off the platform into a new spiritual time that never existed you begin to hear new things that god had planned and things that you are able to do yourself and now we're getting into the season where we need to be activated and literally start doing those things i want to thank all those who who follow this facebook live or the my youtube out there you get filled with revelation all the time i hope you're applying that and you know what don't just apply it make sure you share it with others these words are not my holy words these are gods he's given a whole new way to live why not introduce a whole new culture on the earth instead of trying to change it's really hard to change a culture on the earth but why not introduce heaven's culture why not have a habitation of heaven in your home and not the world i'm not saying you have to throw everything out there is some funny things out there that are decent uh there are different games you can get and play or make up some of your own with your family i know my family was very creative growing up uh we had a lot of drama people in our lives and we had a lot of leaders and i can tell you the most challenging children you have right now are probably some of the most anointed that's a tip on letting you know that's why they are like that maybe they have a very powerful personality you know they have a strong will and they're so you know why god likes people who are strong-willed because when they learn his you can't change it you can't make them stop it god says that he likes strong-willed people when he gets him on the path he has nobody can pull them off so maybe that will encourage some of the parents out there who are now doing 24-hour a day homeschooling or home living i bet your children are excited about it they probably get to see you more now than they ever have before and so like i said take advantage of this time maybe have some cooking classes with your children they love to learn to do new things all the time my parents did that with us too that's why i actually do know how to cook and my sister jen who is here where are you jen just say hello i don't like her she gonna come say hello you know i couldn't do this without her i have a whole team of people here some of my family are part of what we do but this is my baby sister we call her number 15. thank you for saying hi jen we got some we have some fun things planned also like we're gonna do j and k in the kitchen i don't know when we'll do that but hopefully maybe during this next two weeks we'll be able to do that and we're actually have some cooking classes for y'all in our own kitchen now you know if i'm doing it's going to be sweets i have a sweet tooth blame it on jesus jesus loved honeycomb he lived on it all the time and i happen to know that before the throne of god people actually leave sweet treats for him because he loves them so we do have something a fun time in the kitchen plan with everybody and maybe you learn a super new recipe that we have for you but we have to have fun in these days also we're going to help you have fun we're going to have the fun depot and one of our events that we have broadcast will be just for children and they will be very excited of course you can listen and you can watch and we'll let you know well in advance we're going to have that we're going to have some really fun things for children and they will love learning about heaven and who their god is so i want you to look forward to this is a special time god can meet your needs you know i'm going to declare right now father i thank you for meeting the needs of everyone watching god and their other family members and those even not watching father i pray that you will give this team who's over this whole uh take now and the virus that they will give you give them great ideas on how to help in finances or even delay payments on things i do want to let you know there are actually already companies you're right jenna need a drink we've heard from companies that are actually going to delay people's payments if you have monthly payments doing different places planet fitness is one of those places if you're ever interested by the way i'm giving them a free commercial i am a member of planet fitness i don't always agree with the videos that they're showing you know on the screens but they have great equipment they have a great plan some of it's very inexpensive and it's a good way to get in shape which the holy spirit has said to us since we've been doing this heaven thing get in shape we have a long race to run but planet fitness has already announced because you know now they have to do all their stuff online and if you if you can sign up and watch it online learn some new exercises and stuff but they've already announced that they are not going to be charging their monthly fees as long as this is going on and you're not able to use their gym they're not going to charge you they're going to withhold your membership payments and i do know that there are other companies out there doing that and there are still some a few restaurants open of course two thumbs up for chick-fil-a chick-fil-a that's a company that was founded by god and is a really promotes the gospel if you work for chick-fil-a you are blessed in this world if you've never eaten a chick-fil-a don't show up on sunday because they will not be open they want to make sure you get to go to church we're going to talk about church in just a minute but chick-fil-a is open i think most of the ones that are is probably drive-through but there's even some that actually can come to the door the restaurant they've taken orders right there and then filling them for you they are actually getting witty ideas instead of just closing it all down because you know we can't meet in the restaurants or meet out in other places and i know you're missing a lot of your special favorite things do you know there's a thing called the royal fast that god taught me a long time ago the royal fast is even harder than the daniel fast you know to eat almost nothing is actually harder than giving up every one of your favorite things and you wouldn't believe it was unless you tried it but on the royal fast that's what he has me do off and on you don't go to your favorite places you don't even wear your favorite clothes okay you don't get to uh go and be with your friends who are your favorite friends you fast that and spend that time with him so i like to look at this as part of the royal fast because you can't go to your sporting events you can't go to your concerts you know you can't go out to your favorite eating places you can't meet with all your 20 or 50 friends you've got i pray god you've got friends and god if there are people out there that don't have any send them good friends who will lift up their life and not crush them down or held back you need friends in your life you need people in your life who are going to inspire and encourage you especially to know god but there are many places and even god i pray for those who have their weddings planned during this time family reunions planned i know a lot of things are getting interrupt interrupted right now i just want to encourage you again as i said this is for a temporary time remember the hourglass thing the sands of time are moving through and eventually this time will be gone and i hope you have great memories that you will create and make during this time make up fun photo shoots with your family but there are a few restaurants still open out there you know just check out and find out who they are get their time frame if you still feel like you need to go there meet with very small groups of people and like here in our city now they have closed the beaches one of my favorite places even if i don't get to go there very often so people were learning this is the thing people were learning that they could not gather inside places and have big events together or just have a party together they started doing it at the beach our beach here is free it's a very long beach a beautiful beach and they started doing that i mean huge groups 50 people here and they were meeting and they weren't listening to what was being asked of them and so now they have closed our beaches i'm sure people are still bicycling up and down you know maybe outside the beach but i just want to encourage you please try your very best to go along with what they have asked us to do for a short period of time and when we do that things are happier the atmosphere is better knowing that we're working with the government or your city authorities or other people who are in charge they're wanting to help to preserve our life and like i said before this is not about limiting our life this is giving the right to live without that virus and father i pray for all those out there if it's already invaded your life family members or yourself god i pray for them and take authority over the sickness jesus was over sickness we take authority everybody to say it together i will no longer tolerate sickness sickness or any virus or any virus in my city in my city in my home in my home and i command it and i command it to go to go in jesus name jesus in jesus name and do you know there's even a blessing when you bless your dinner did you know that you should end your blessing the bible says that when you do that when you bless god and you bless your food it says he will take sickness far from you you may not have ever read that scripture but you know i do remind god this is what your word says i i thank you for blessing my food to the nourishment of my body i thank you for the provision of it and that might be a good idea to do that now even if you don't have food thank him for it and asking to bless what is coming to you our own family experienced people we would give so much away our own family we'd even give our food away and then my dad would have a set the table and thank god for the food and i am not making this up people would show up at the door with food so don't limit yourself to what man thinks or man's ways not even your normal ways step outside your box and believe that god cares about you but yes this is good news chick-fil-a is still open it's all drive-through there's many few a few drive-throughs like i said they're different in every city so check in your city make sure you pray for your local government as well as the federal government pray for all them to hear god's plan to get witty ideas to use sound wisdom get them to step outside the box and make sure you bless ask god to bless them it says to bless those who are over you when you begin to do the things the bible says things are going to start happening for you so don't get moved by things you move things this is a kingdom age quote you don't get moved by things they don't get moved by this virus are you having to stay at home are you being quarantined make sure you move things by declaring and decreeing taking authority in the spirit realm over anything the enemy is trying to do against you those of you who already command an army from heaven and yes that is possible jesus did we can too he harkens they hearken unto the word of the lord he is the lord of hosts he sends them here and yes it is our privilege to send them to pull down strongholds they are our mighty weapons to put on strongholds against the enemy and i know jen is standing here with something in her hand if i'm talking even in a church or someplace my family have to get in front of me and jump up and down because i'm so focused like when i look at this camera i see you it isn't just a camera it is a portal to the whole world that is watching and when i bless you in the name of the lord you know what happens the host of heaven the army will carry blessings into every home that is right now connected to this facebook page right now whether you're watching it now or later i bless you in the name of the lord and your finances and your families and your food supply your creativity i bless you in jesus name because i really mean that and i'm gonna let jen say something to me what is it jen oh okay yes we will do we will add something else because you know there is somebody on the earth on the earth in this country especially working very hard for all of us even if you don't like him even if you don't understand him even if he's not perfect i will tell you this yes god chose trump and yes we here at one quest international that's my company and studio oq1 we are supporting our president not just in his decisions right now but in his reelection which god has assured me for all those wondering yes he is still god is still planning on him winning in 2020 and we have created this little uh video to support what he's doing letting you know we trust and that god has chosen him and believe in him so we're going to let you see our little promo for the trump 2020 race [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so well we're back i hope you enjoyed that and again as i said that we are going to support um president trump right now in the decisions you know they're not easy the decisions he has to make but he has such hope for this country and not just this country but for the people of this country and i know you hear me talk about america but you know what this is where i'm from this is my realm this is where god sent me to live i am aware that there are other countries out there even great countries that have done wonderful things for god you know i could start listing them and man then we go forever but i do want to say you know some of the greatest revivals we've had in the past many of them were actually in um in the uk and i can tell you they're the covenanters of scotland there was patrick and all the kings he won for jesus christ in ireland and then the welsh revival wow if you never read about that maybe in this time you should go back and and to study these things and maybe share something with your family because there were great people on the earth before we were here and we're going to be great for god because he wants us to be and then even when some of you go on to heaven there'll be more great people on the earth because god wants us to be great for him and with him and so i am grateful for president trump if you haven't decided i would encourage you to vote for him and nominate him you know in this new election in 2020 which will start a whole divine decade for us and while we're talking about your time right now at home this little break in time uh we're going to actually show some fun things because we like to laugh laughter is a medicine it's also a weapon because satan can't get to you when you are laughing so i hope they make you laugh here's something we've taken off of facebook and other people have made it's fun so here we go we're going to start watching some of them right now i hope it makes you laugh and we did enjoy every single one of these jen did her best to get some of the best ones and if you have opportunity to see them or even create some yourself that might be a good idea i think one of my favorite ones of course is this whole discussion about the toilet paper you know i do have some rolls i haven't counted them lately but um maybe you could count them and let us know how many you have and put it in your comments you know that might be fun for people to read oh i've got 10 you know i've got 100 if you've got 100 you better be sharing them with other people right and uh but people can be very fun and you know who gives that humor it's god and so i hope you laughed at those there's many many more out there um being shown and this is funny i love it when the pastors and this i'm just going to give rod parsley a you know a thumb two thumbs up rod that was a great little funny thing you did with the toilet paper with the tp and uh i think tp's taking on a whole new meaning right now during this time never have we had so much discussion about toilet paper and uh who would who would think that would be an item of interest right not just that of course paper towels come right in behind that and tissues and we go down that hole line and you can tell what the most important things are right when you go to the store what is missing the tp and even some of the suggestions that other people have of what we could use instead i haven't found one good suggestion okay i'm not adam and eve i'm not gonna go pluck leaves off the tree that's not gonna happen with me and so but i know people people love humor and sometimes that's a door that will open things for people to have discussions with you like my pink hair i might mention briefly about the pink hair i honestly i mind sitting here i cannot see the pink hair on my head and believe it or not sometimes i forget it's there but this was not my plan this is an example of god's plan right here this painter on my head and yes it does divide asunder the flesh from the spirit people who don't like it who bash it who say horrible things against it they're operating in the flesh the people think this is a great idea wow god is so creative look at that you know what the rainbow belongs to him why not have color on your head why not wear some of it on your head and so that's the spirit the walking in the spirit walking in the flesh and so god's bringing many new things to this earth hair color is one of them and i'm taking another little drink of my strength that my man ran up and got for me because you know i've been talking a lot i'll be talking a whole lot more and so why not put fun in your life and i remember years ago when the holy spirit told me yes fun is a medicine laughter is a medicine the word says it is but he said to me while i'm at a platform i can't remember where it was might have been up north somewhere he said did you know that in this time that laughter is actually a weapon fun is a weapon i mentioned that a minute ago why is it a weapon satan will put all kinds of thoughts in your head and the word says take every thought captive that takes itself above the plans of the life of god that means anything that is not good anything that does not bring life or hope or fun creativity or you know to inspire you encourage you it says to take those thoughts captive that means don't let them keep running through your mind if you've got bad thoughts running from you through your mind guess who sent them it was hell right not heaven heaven wants life for us and life more abundantly for us so you need to realize what is running to your mind what are your thoughts saying what you think about enough is what you will do and that's what my husband says also you will do what you will to do and your will is affected by the things you read the things you watch and get this even the things you say will affect the way you live your life so make sure you are laughing that you make others laugh especially in this day it really makes the enemy very unhappy i will give you a list of things that satan hates he hates people who love especially when they're not being loved back he hates it when we're kind to one another right he hates it when we laugh he hates it when we learn to celebrate he hates it when we realize that he is the one causing all the grief all the hate he comes to kill steal and destroy that's going on in your life that comes from one place and they don't get any thumbs up they get thumbs down there's two thumbs down for help right and while you're doing your dinner blessing why not ask for triple trouble in hell you'd be amazed what you could ask for and god will actually do it and so i just want you to realize there's a real devil i have been to heaven i have been to hell you want to choose heaven hell is not a place it's not going to be r r there's no parties in hell no food in hell no rest in hell that does not exist there's torture plenty of it non-going ongoing torture that is what is there don't side with the enemy don't help him advertise negative things hateful things mean things don't repeat things that are going on with your friends and especially don't repeat negative things about your family if you're going to stand for their salvation you need to make a stand the bible says stand and stand there for that means you declare that there will become a a living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ you declare that they will not miss the destiny god has planned for them you declare that they will know christ and serve him all of their life those are powerful piercing words in the spirit realm and yes it does do something for your loved ones as well because you're making a stand for them even if they're not nice to you and i know that happens okay they're not nice they hate you they don't want to talk to you all that comes from what and the enemy is doing with their lives so why not make a stand and don't change the stand in other words don't be double-minded if you're saying something powerful god will do don't turn around and say the opposite you don't want to wipe out what you just prayed and i can tell right now in this time you need to be declaring that this is the time for celebration for expectation a time for god to propel you on your path that it says we go from glory to glory do you know that's an upward motion i want to go from glory to glory to glory i don't want to go from glory to the pit and fall into despair and fear glory to the pit where are you going you are going nowhere so kick out of your life choose what you will to lose from your soul any fear any anger any any uh deception any confusion all that stuff comes from the enemy you bind to your soul because i will say this one of the things we will be learning about over these this next week or so is the keys to the kingdom and how that opens up there's my key right there how the keys to the kingdom will open up things in your life you never had before and it will eliminate things you don't want your life that you have not wanted for a very long time but keep coming back and bombarding you or tormenting you you can use the keys of the kingdom to get rid of them an artist friend of mine did a painting and sent it to me which is so beautiful it shows a person with a key about to put it in a keyhole and inside this whole keyhole you see heaven what are they doing when you use the keys of the kingdom you are unlocking heaven to operate in your life so i know a lot of revelation but right now we have decided and god has asked us to do this broadcast mainly to let you know that this is not the time that he's wrapping everything up this is not the time for the tribulation and as the holy spirit says the four horses of the apocalypse are still in the barn and you know what the nephilim are not roaming the earth right now coming to knock on your door and drag you out in the streets uh the antichrist this is truth the antichrist and you can say i believe it or not the antichrist the antichrist spirit is on the earth because that's satan and the antichrist spirit is anything that is against god that would be like a false religion that's an antichrist spirit anyone who is against christ himself and speaks against him trying to say he is not the son of god that none of that stuff is true in the bible that is an antichrist spirit the antichrist spirit is on the earth but the antichrist himself and there's even some people to say he's not going to be here either they are mistaken at one time generations down god's timeline those things he said in his word they will happen he has a purpose for them happening even when we don't understand them but you're in a blessed time to be alive on this earth you are not living in the time of the tribulation or the perilous times or the antichrist who will actually embody a person it's just satan embodying a person that's what that is the antichrist is not on the earth he and what he will do is not on this earth right now because the word says until he until he is removed that withholds the antichrist can't come guess who that he is it's us the body of christ ruling and reigning with christ the manifested sons and daughters speaking to the lamb the sea and the air commanding things to happen with jesus christ and they happen if they were all still here the antichrist would not be effective people wouldn't even receive him it wouldn't be the tribulation time because this time of the manifested sons and daughters on the earth things will be great things will be healed things will be better we're living in the time okay god's time right now is for us to be great for him to take the knowledge of the glory that's not just a saying that is an action the glory of god coming from you is like it's like something begins to just go and waves from you and it will remove the enemy in people's lives it will invade their life their very person with the presence of god it's like a cosmic shock wave like if i have my staff right now and i just hit it on the ground wherever i declare things from god and i hit my staff which is always out with me at three in the morning as i'm declaring the things of god i see in the spirit a shock wave of the fire of god going that's what the glory will do you will take that around this world and that hasn't even begun to happen yet so we're not living in the perilous times we're living in the great times of god the times and all those things would begin to happen he talked about be excited you're alive be excited you have children yes it's a good idea to get married and have children they'll be greater than you will look forward to your children doing greater things and being greater for christ than even you this is just the beginning of a time on the earth that's never existed so this is not the very end he is not going to wrap it all up and roll this earth away when he hasn't even begun to do the things he himself declared would happen look forward to celebrating with you i look forward to sharing with you that god is about great things he's behind the scenes of everything on this earth right now even leaders it's a time of being shifted god is shifting the leaders of governments so he can then shape their nation and that's what's happening in our country right now no matter what you think of it or how you look at it the virus thing that gets attached and now it'll be gone okay i hope you'll be greater and more powerful in god and like i said give your family a lot of love because one day you'll be out there back to work again maybe you'll even have your own business look forward to the great things of god trust him to do the things and thank him for the things he's bringing to your life and so father we all declare together let's declare this together everybody watching make sure y'all do it [Music] say father father as a child of god as a child of god i make a declaration i make a declaration that this virus this virus is passing quickly it's passing quickly so your time so your time can be done in the earth can be done on the earth and that is what will be established and that is what will be established we all ask for we all ask for and receive and receive and want to walk in and want to walk in your will your will your way your way we invite heaven we invite him and push

bless her so much you would bless her you would overcome her with blessings overcome her family with blessings that you would bless them in everything that they set their hand to and lord we thank you now as we just honor cat as she comes in jesus name amen amen come let us have it sister [Music] good morning this is early for me for those of you who don't know me i i go to sleep around 6 30 or 7 now it used to be four but now i'm up even later so uh i'm i'm so glad to be here you know because i get stretched in this time and yet some of the most powerful things come out of me in this time and so i i can promise you first of all i'm going to share what was going on in the spirit realm while all this worship is going on you have some new hosts that are posted here as sentinels and uh i used to call them well well they look like native americans but no they've always looked like that there's whole tribes of angels that look like that that wear garments like that with the symbols you know and the way that that came into this world was god has always had seers and some of the first nations were seers and so they took some of those images that they've seen on these beings and they put them on their garments they put them on their on their tents their homes uh many of the things you buy that are called southwest images are actually images from the throne room and he has some pretty wild drummers up there and they were here today and there were two new ones i had not seen they weren't even here yesterday they're about 70 foot tall they had fallout headdress on them they had pelts with living eyes the feathers had living eyes every feather in the headdress they were like blue eyes all over them and their garments just shown with the glory and there's one right there and there's one right there and they were dancing the whole time we were dancing and i could hear that drum i love the drum drum sound from the throne room um when that is played and they were playing somewhere outside playing there were those two main ones but there are others and then some came in and were dancing on this platform and i recently saw the same ones in reno nevada on the platform and they're angels of freedom they were they were doing a freedom dance here and uh freedom is coming from everything at the enemy in golden in denver colorado [Applause] and if you've ever seen some of the the first nations or the native americans dance when they do that thing where they're like this they were up here there were two of them and they're like dressed in blue they have blue feathers going at the very top of their head right up here and there have eyes in those feathers and all the feathers coming off of their wings have eyes and when i saw them in reno i asked the lord what are they and he goes those are freedom dancers bringing freedom to the area so i i can tell you also that god is taking las vegas and reno as regions of as regions of glory this will be a region of glory where crime or sickness where disease cannot exist so i was i was so excited when i saw them here today and went so i knew who they were i knew what they were and i could tell you the men that were dancing you were dancing with them up here on the platform and the glory was just rolling off of them as they were dancing the glory and so freedom and liberty is coming uh tour land two to colorado to nevada god is taking those regions all right so your lives will not be the same and even after this weekend you cannot remain the same because when you have stepped into and receive what god is offering in this time you can't miss or escape receiving it you're going to get it because you said yes everyone yell yes now look look up and so say i say yes [Applause] and so uh well i'll try to speak if i can but they they're really outside right now looking in there are they are huge beings and in in their chest they have these strips of like it looks like gold metal to me it's probably real gold i'm sure it is and in them and all these metal pieces are shaped like that and they have living eyes in them in the front in the back to see anything of the enemy that comes against this ministry against your people these beings will drive them off and deal harshly with [Applause] them yes yeah just like the things of the enemy are drawn where there's evil where there's darkness where there's hate where there's violence and i know a lot of people think well i won't go watch movies that have immorality in or defiling language but violence is just as bad it is and i want to remind you that one of the accusations the father had against lucifer was you have filled yourself with violence so be aware when you go to watch something make sure it's not graphic sadistic torturing violence because that will go in your soul you don't want it in there amen we're about life not death watch things that give life they bring celebration in your life they're going to help your soul to prosper there is a promise for divine help there really is even as your soul prospers you will prosper in be in hell that is a state of existence coming to the body of christ who will let their soul prosper so we need to keep the darkness out the violence out anything defiling keep it out you have to guard that innermost part of your being the very heart of your being is where your soul is that's why it was so important when god said adam became a living soul we are not just people we're not just a spirit we're the with a body people go well we have a soul no you are a soul according to the father you are a living soul it's one of the main parts of you you can't leave that out of your life you can't remain ignorant of your soul because it's what you think on what you choose and then what you do i would say that was you yeah so more and more in this time we must be aware of of our soul and what we're letting in there as a man think us in that place so is he out of your soul will flow the way you live your life the issues of life out of it before the issues of life that means the way you will live your life that's what the father told me and so the soul is very key in your life even in your children's lives what you put in their soul growing up it's going to help them become who god wants them to become you're not just raising a child not even the next generation you are shaping souls in your life every day you're shaping your own soul your soul gets fed 24 hours a day whatever's going around you whatever you're whatever you're seeing watching saying or hearing it goes in there it goes in there a lot of meetings but i get excited i had to almost sit on myself to not start screaming [Applause] i've heard that around the throne i have been there and i've heard it it is stunning you will get so undone by the glory over the throne and the seraphim who come down and dip out of there they're so full of the fire they are on fire they sing some of the most beautiful song they will dip down over the throne and go back up and dip down over the throne and go back up yeah satan didn't get any of them even in heaven they choose how much of a relationship they want it was obvious and you would think the ones who were created for worship would not have been deceived but they were the very ones because they followed they began to follow the one who led them not the one who made them if they were deceived by the enemy deception is still it is an anti-christ spirit and even then it was it was even jesus said it was then it was there even then it was there and so i think one of the most one of the most number one weapons the enemy uses today when he realizes because of our relationship our intimacy with god when he realizes he's not going to get us to just outright sin then he will try to bring us into into deception or distraction because we need to stay on that path we are running after him and no matter what i talk about about the encounters that i i've had or what i've seen or the revelation he's given me still the number one thing in my life is to pursue him to be passionate about him to desire his heart his ways his words his presence it feeds me i eat less and less because i eat of him there's a whole revelation about eat my flesh and drink my blood that is total consumption of who he is you are totally consuming all of him all of what he did i love to talk about the blood of christ i was caught up to heaven take him back in time and i saw him pouring out his blood on the mercy seat so many encounters but nothing more powerful than knowing the love of christ to know him to know not just know about him but to know him and he said that if you pursue him with all of your heart you will find him and when you find him you will want to be just like him it says when we see him we will no longer know in part or understand in part it says now we see darkly like through a glass we see in part we know in part but when you see him you will no longer know in part that means you will know details that means you will know his heart his ways have his thoughts so don't ever stop doing that no matter what you go after in your life don't ever leave him out i have written in the front of my bible don't ever let me get to a place where i do not need you [Music] in the past god would do things to make sure that people weren't elevated above because of the revelation that they got you know even in paul that thorn of flesh he got was blindness it would come and go it would attack him and go attack him and go and a lot of people don't know what that is they they try to figure it out but it's in the word because paul said the first time i came to you you wanted to give me everything if possible you would have plucked out your very eyes and given them to me why would he have said that why did he need to scribe all the time because it was hard for him to see to write so whenever he penned a letter that said i have penned this with my own hand you need to go back and read those because he was so fierce about having this given to them and them living a right life a powerful life he would write that himself even with that on him now i can tell you that he stopped asking for that to be removed when christ said my grace is sufficient my grace is sufficient for the evil for for the day for the evil thereof and that was grace for abundant life christ was talking about christ never came to put sickness disease infirmities he never brought poverty with him he didn't bring fear with him he didn't bring hopelessness or unworthiness he didn't bring any of those he came to bring light and life more abundantly and we need to walk on that today now not just when you go to heaven [Music] in the past people died to move to heaven to walk in a certain way on in their life they were free from everything creative inventive in heaven adventure excitement fun no fear no hate no deception no distractions filled with the light and the glory of god but in this time on the earth we have a commission to live a whole new way so what you've been hearing me talk about is not just some nice things to make you feel good it is so you can have a new lifestyle to live on earth as they do in heaven that's not going to be a normal life it's going to be the most amazing life you have ever lived in this world and god wants it wants it seen openly and visibly in our lives the goodness of god overwhelming us flowing off of us wherever we go the creativity of god we are supposed to be creators like our father say amen let us make man in our image what is your image he's a creator what is christ's image a commander they rule there's no higher level anywhere in existence than the the triune godhead and yet how awesome is that that he said that statement in genesis let us make man in our image and after our likeness that word likeness means operate like we do we are joint ears with christ he walked in so much and we're living so far below that but in this day because of revelation this is what revelation is it comes from the heart of the father it does not come from the mind of man so it will not sound normal to you it won't even make sense to you sometimes it seems absolutely impossible but with god nothing is impossible all things through christ are possible so we need to understand and realize what did christ give us when he came here what was he on this earth walking as a righteous man he had power and authority over the storms he multiplied the food he raised the dead all the time he never blinked at one demon not one demon was he afraid of where he went they were tormented he could shift time and step in the spirit realm and walk through people he didn't walk around those crowds he walked through them because the spirit realm supersedes this natural realm that's why angelic means can walk through the walls so christ did all these amazing powerful things and then he says the things i did you will do and greater things than he did we will do we're still trying to figure out the things he did you're not getting anything without faith you're not ever going to get to a point where you don't need faith to do things you have to start trusting god and telling him you trust him he wants you to say something he loves it when you make declarations he gets up off the throne and he shouts when he sees people on the earth with faith christ didn't say when i come will i see power will i see dominion will i see creativity will i see souls being saved no we didn't say they said well i see faith and so many people they just want things but they don't even use their faith you go from glory to glory because of your faith your faith can grow when you when you hit a certain level your faith just gets accelerated where no matter what he has said no matter what that word says you live it like it's truth we all have measures but did you realize that a measure means it can be increased [Applause] if you pour something in a measuring cup can you add more and you can get a bigger cup until it's pouring over isn't that what it says overflowing if you get to a place in him i want everybody to say this christ operated without measure on this earth [Music] his dream and his purpose is for us to get to that place in him where we also operate without measure i know what i'm talking about because i was uh in law i i worked in law that was a god thing told totally let me tell you they hired me with no experience because i was anointed with favor and literally i was hired because of the favor not because of my typing skills trust me you type 40 words a minute no one's going to want you in the natural but i was taught i was hired and i was taught by the lawyers how to do real estate law estate planning business law i learned all kinds of these different levels of the different law and the legal system one thing i really got was in a probate in a state i totally knew what it meant when it said you were a joint heir if you're an heir to somebody even like in england the heir to the throne no one can say you can't have that it's written as law in those countries so guess what was written in heaven as law that there was a last will and testament called the new testament that the the names of these books aren't just put there because they sound good every one of those names means something like revelations someone tell me there's nowhere in the bible that talks about revelations i said god calls me a revelator i'm here to reveal heaven i'm here to reveal the spirit realm i'm here here to reveal the true authority of the believer the dominion and authority of the believer and they go there's no such thing as a revelator i think john was one a revelator simply means you reveal the things of god and what do you think revelations were those were the revelations john re received and shared things never heard of before things that were hard to comprehend you think the book of revelations is easy to understand it's because it came from the heart of god and he reveals himself all the time even john the baptist gave some of the most shocking revelations of all time he was totally shifting the way that those who believed in god were going to live hey they knew you had to go to temple and make sacrifices and once a year your sins were forgiven and here was this wild man wearing camel hair turned inside out lived in the wilderness he looked like a wild man ate locust and honey was his diet pizza and chocolate ice cream is a whole lot better and so is pink hair pizza there's pizza in heaven yes i do like it but i like thin crusts not that zero calories yes and zero calories in heaven it's one of the reasons why they call it heaven but it's the place where things have never been heard of or seen or even understood but god has prepared for those that love him but i love the next part of that scripture unless and accept it be revealed by his spirit so that shows you the things of god can be revealed there are mysteries in the word and the first time you hear them you'll be shocked that they were there all along but you didn't see them because they were a mystery but god loves to share them with his children so be more like a child laugh a lot more dream imagine the impossible there's places telling you not to even do that anymore and yet let me tell you if you're an artist if you don't imagine things you can't you can't produce or create that god puts that in us to be creators uh like an inventor that's still a creator right inventions witty ideas we're creators you should be creating something all the time you should be doing something new all the time you should be new all the time i heard the father yell tell them to be new do something new go someplace new think of something new say something new don't remain the same old same-o that's right yeah don't be boring see this world needs to see this they need to hear this they need to know that you can live without fear when you belong to jesus christ because you do have power over all the power of the enemy that we can crush the plans of darkness that we can have none of him in us [Music] and be dangerous [Applause] i love the whole army thing yeah heaven has an army strange weird fierce unshakable unstoppable created by the hand of god himself to defeat that army of darkness but they were never created to guard heaven that army didn't even kick out satan the father did the father did he didn't even get off the throne went up there shaking in heaven he wasn't shaken in heaven but lucifer was going around tempting all of them he knew he would lose but he was going to let others see who really was worshiping him who really had given herself to what they were created for we replace all the angels that worship before the throne so you go before the throne every single time you worship that's how he inhabits the praises of his people you're connecting with heaven every single time you worship so when you hear about heaven it should be something oh yes i was going to tell you what else i saw right before the trumpet blew i heard the lord say that calvary is coming i was really having fun in this service because i was seeing um heaven here and what they were doing then i saw the people connecting the worship connecting the dancing connecting that they were all hearing what heaven was saying and singing so they played it and the dancers were actually impressed by what the angels were dancing up here they were doing the same thing yeah and even the ones outside and the drummers that were lightning bolts were shooting off of those drums [Applause] and and i would get so undone i had to sit down so i wouldn't fall down because the glory was so thick in here and they would dance and dance then he would turn and look in the window to watch you dance and worship and flag and shout [Music] [Applause] [Music] every congregation needs a seer because you get so excited to really see you are a part of what heaven is doing that's right because every time you shout it whenever you shouted they shouted in the throne room every time you shouted something the throne room shouted it [Applause] and the father would sit there and he would laugh and laughter he threw his head back because there are those who worship in spirit and truth on the earth and every time we do it it pierces the enemy and every time we do it there's the father began to laugh and it goes like dominoes around all of heaven it just starts like a wave of people laughing and laughing and laughing because there's a people who worship in spirit and truth the enemy doesn't want anyone to worship anything but him and you you know he stole the glory that's what he did he wanted to be the glory and have the glory and he wanted all of it even when he was in heaven that was a bad decision bad decision so we get to carry the glory produce the glory and carry the glory around this world for him and is going to undo this world they will be undone i've seen some of that happening and i know it will it will cause thousands to run into the kingdom because they know what kind of life they've been living they know what darkness is everything darkness has marked everything it's left its mark in the movies in books and children's toys in apparel it's just marked everywhere it's about to be wiped out because heaven's going to put its mark on everything [Applause] you'll be able to buy home decor things to decorate your home with rugs things to put on your windows even the furniture will have symbols and images of heaven on it and you are past it'll speak because god is going to put his anointing on it it's one of the ways the glory will invade this earth that's one of the reasons why heaven is invading this earth you'll sit on your amazing self of this anointed and you'll just hear sounds from heaven your walls will release frequencies from heaven in them you've already created when you create an atmosphere for heaven to inhabit your home and it will if they see the life of god they see worship they see honor being given to the name of the lord jesus they cannot escape they cannot they want to be and know your lives they're watching your lives they've all been watching your lives and they're cheering you on they are heaven is very much aware of what's going on this earth your own family members are up there cheering you on run your race don't get off the track this is an accelerated time the race will be greater the impact on the earth will be greater the glory will be greater the revelation will be greater the creativity will be greater the blessings and the and the wealth will be greater than ever before what we build for god on the earth in the spirit and then the physical is about to be accelerated because this is god's time for that to happen so when you step into what he wants you can't escape being blessed you're not going to escape he used to say that to me other times you are not going to escape when you say you're going to go say this and you will not escape doing it okay no matter what they think no matter where it is or what it is i'm saying it and i'll say it as loud and as boldly and as often as you want to you want me to i laid down my life died to myself and i live in christ and the devil can't impact a dead person he can't tempt a dead person he can't put fear in them if there's none of him in you he can't do anything to you amen jesus said i give you power over all the power of the enemy to tread upon so i can't even say it serpents and scorpions tread upon them and nothing by any means shall harm you we're living in those days in this new time we are living in those days that our life will be different because we will be living on earth as they do in heaven if you heard me talk you know a lot about heaven you should know a lot about heaven because god is bringing revelation on purpose why is he showing us heaven why do we need to know how it operates what is life like there what goes on what places does he have what do they get to do you need to know that because we're going to live like that down here oh yeah they worship it's called living worship not just in the throne room bowing down sometimes everybody just jumps up and down for fun [Applause] yes it's holy but it is fun some people think why should i even go to heaven it's going to be so boring no you've lived boring down here because they have the greatest adventures in heaven god wouldn't have said you must be like little children to enter into the kingdom of he'd be in big trouble if we all got up there and we were like you know old minded with all the fun stuff he's made but he knows when you come there that's how you feel because you're free of any cares any concerns you're not always warring just to to stay safe and pay your rent everyone up there pays for nothing god has already made a provision and supplied your mansion's built before you ever get there and everything you want love or need is already there but god has a sense of humor the number one thing before besides going in the throne room people love to do is take tours of heaven and they have tour guide angels that has a cap that says tour guide and they have a money changer belt you know the little things that go push click click click and the coins come out nobody has money in heaven they do it for humor and and and you'll get there for the first time they'll they already know who the new people are because they're like this and then walked up one of these tour guide angels and they go um do you have your pass [Laughter] on purpose and you hear people all around they're giggling because they know you don't need a pass however the real characters go his name is jesus christ so if you've got one in your family this probably will be the response some of the others are like we need a pass who gave out the passes and people laugh i mean they will laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh there's no past required and you're not going to give anybody money to go anywhere [Applause] you can step on a road of light and just go yourself and everybody talks about the humor of god but but when you really experience it you realize how funny he can be and his goodness people live in his goodness about a year ago he started saying start declaring the goodness of god over your family your friends especially your enemies there's almost nothing more fun than blessing those who are cursing you as a seer especially it's a lot of fun because i see the demons controlling the people who are blasting me and i'm blessing them and those demons are going stop [Music] they're screaming it's like arrows piercing them because i'm giving them life which cancels out the death that's why he said bless those right who curse you pray for those who despitefully it's powerful blessing is a weapon joy and celebration is a weapon fun is a weapon they laugh all the time in heaven they have amazing adventures there's so many places to go and visit in heaven valley of the falls passionate paradise techno city cartoon village jello land the friendly forest the sky mansions valley i always say valley falls i love that place the mountain of spices that they mention in the word really exist in heaven the all the aromas of thanksgiving and fall the leaves are like this big and they're the most beautiful uh every kind of color you can imagine if you love the fall your mansion will probably be in the mountain spices i mean from burgundies to literal gold and all those shades in between the deep vibrant oranges and some are even blue these trees are like 200 foot tall and you can hike as far as you want and never get tired [Music] if you like to backpack on horses the horses will be it will be their pleasure to take you and they will have conversations with you all the way up they'll even show you some of the best places to go and see a tour guide without the cap oh yeah the hunting is in heaven is something else people say nothing dies oh no nothing dies [Laughter] you have photo shoots you capture what you're hunting by photo you have a scope camera i'm serious about all this uh somebody well known i don't ever mention their name but i always tell the story it's amazing one of the encounters i had a young man had ended his suffering and a lot of people were telling this uh prophet that it was too bad that his son was in hell when he had served god his whole life the people in the world weren't saying that we are so sorry that you have lost your son we know you loved him we know how we would feel so you know we we are having compassion for you we really are caring about you and we'll pray even people who don't pray will tell people we'll pray that's the world saying that most of the body was saying they're burning in hell and that was the first time god taught me about the difference between suicide and ending your life and ending your suffering he said when you're not in your right mind control of emotion whether it's emotional physical or mental you're not in control of your own emotions you're not you cannot think clearly or make decisions you just know you cannot suffer any longer so you end your suffering and he said those people go to heaven he made me go to the dictionary which he does many times uh he has me gives me scriptures in the word but he also says to go look in the dictionary to see what man says about it he said go look up the word suicide and it says willingly knowingly intelligently taking your own life he said but what most people are experiencing that's not that's not what they're doing okay a suicide bomber or a terrorist that is real suicide they know that their life will end and they purposely go do it because they know usually to bring violence or hurt to someone else to make others suffer is usually what suicide is about so these these bombers are coming bomb strapped on them they're intelligently making this decision oh yeah i'm willing to do this to take the lives of others they committed suicide but people who either through accidents or mental stress or emotional uh when they get to despair when you reach despair it's like sickness that they can't handle any longer so they're ending their suffering it's not that they don't love you it's not that they don't want to live anymore they can't stand the suffering and i literally was caught up to heaven and told that and the father said you will tell people about that and i had people say don't say that how can you say that i went would you like to go stand before the living god and have him explain what this means and then you say i'm not going to say it and they go well maybe not and he said this is going to help relieve the pain and agony that people have been put through with the loss of their loved ones who no longer had any control over their minds or their thoughts or their will and he said those people i would be unjust and unrighteous especially if they knew me i would be unjust and unrighteous just to give them to the enemy who actually destroyed them and he said you let them know they're in heaven they're with me and so he actually did this because of that young man because of what happened to him and what people were saying to this this prophet god said i'm going to show you where his son is this person was visiting our church i was doing hospitality for him when he came and i actually had bought all the stuff to put the food together and in the parking lot of my church she caught me up to heaven and i saw this miss this man's son i think he was probably in his 20s and i didn't know anything about him and i saw him standing in his father's mansion that was still being built and there was a trophy on this mantle that said satan zero god won and that was because satan didn't get his son and he said you're gonna go tell him that his son is with me in heaven and then i and this went on for a while he caught me up a second time he said i'm going to show you what he's now doing now and i saw him putting equipment on on this horse he was going to go backpacking and up a trail ride up the mountain spices and i saw this at the foothills was this huge mansion that he had come out of that i knew was his father's mansion and so it was this beautiful amazing place all made out of stone living stones not just stone there's nothing normal or plain in heaven there were this whole place was built with living stones and so i saw his son and he was talking i can't wait for my dad to get here one day man he's going to be so excited to find out there's some other way to hunt animals this is going to be exciting this is his first time going up there by the way i'm sure he had some other thoughts about that but but he that's what he was doing us i put camera equipment on the stuff on this this beautiful horse there was another horse with some other stuff on it so if you want to camp you can still camp in the mountain of spices without fear of anything attacking you or getting lost because you can't get lost anywhere in heaven you're in heaven so this is where he was going he was going on a hunt he was going on a hunt and i saw him the whole time see they talk about you all the time in heaven they talk about all the fun things you did the things you love to do together you still get to do those things in heaven and so he was excited about his siblings and his father knowing about this this hunting trip he was going on and so he's starting up the mountain of spices and i see these creatures almost transparent peeking around some of the trees and they had a scope camera well he was hunting now they were hunting him [Applause] and the father said hunting will take on a whole new meaning so that's how i learned about that that they do that in heaven and so i saw him i'm doing i started doing other things i saw him another time in his mother's mansion which is right next to his father's mansion and on the walls of that mansion i saw siblings that hadn't even been born yet i saw family pictures of the i knew who the father was i recognized the father i didn't haven't really seen his wife anywhere and you know when he traveled or whatever but i saw the father the mother i saw him i saw another sibling and i saw others that hadn't ever been born yet god knows who he's going to send and while this is this is exciting i know how many more she's going to have and so you have precious things captured memories and things put in your mansion so if you ever wanted to take a photo and you missed it and said man i wish i had taken it the angels take it they print it they frame it and they put it in your mansion [Applause] and i had to give up that gift to do this that was my gift i am a photographer so he used a business person to do all this i'm the ceo of a company he used a business person to reveal this stuff he likes business people they think clearly they're not afraid to make plans for the future they they make sure that they line on everything to see what they need and that it gets done they make sure the people they hire have the gifts and the things that they need they have strategies they have excitement they have creativity they don't mind connecting and contacting with other people no matter what they believe they're not afraid to go talk to people so business people like his son master carpenter and paul the tent maker and luke the physician all them they were in business so you need to be in business i'm serious god in this day will have more entrepreneurs in the body of christ than in the world or you'll be a part of a business or company that's headed up by somebody like that it's coming and so i saw the stuff going on and so i went and wrote everything down i saw and heard i typed it and i brought it typed when he came to speak now i didn't get to hear him speak because i was in the kitchen i was hospitality and i was preparing all his meals and decorating the room he would eat in and i went up to my my pastor and i said um this is what got my pastor knew i was going to heaven all the time and i said oh i said this is what i saw and he said you need to give this to him they need this word desperately it changed their life forever because number one they didn't believe what anyone else was saying about their son being in hell because not only i did not know this but they actually lived their actual home is in the mountains and the thing that they did the most together was hunting now i didn't know that about them at all and so god already see that's this is the evidence he gives that their loved ones are doing things as they always did down here and i didn't know any of this so this is what they knew that i had seen their son and the wife was so healed she wouldn't even go out in public anymore because of the accusations and i want you know what the body of christ needs to stop doing that no matter what happened or how it happened you need to have compassion on those people because if it happened to you you would want compassion given to you amen so yes there's all kinds of fun amazing things to do in heaven and they are never bored they are filled with the light and the love of god they're excited about us about us who are on this earth right now because this is our time to shine like the stars in the heaven where even when we go outside at one point the night will be like light about us the word says that we're that generation that will experience that i know that the word says there will be a generation which is a group and type of people that will be on the earth that will taste of the powers of the age to come the next age after this age is the millennial age and the powers that will be present then for the people is that they will live to be hundreds and hundreds of years old christ will be sitting on the throne his life will permeate the entire earth just like back in the ancient days in the old testament days you know they lived to be five six seven hundred years old so when christ sitting on the throne it will begin to change the earth heal the earth there will be many millions of natural people on the earth that didn't take the mark of the beast nor did they die in the tribulation and people will still have children in that time in heaven you don't have children but if you never had one god has a place in heaven called the reserve of babies if you never had one you can go pick one out it'll be you will be its mother its father you can see it grow step into its destiny its true destiny is to use the gift god your ultimate destiny for everyone sitting here not necessarily what you do for a job aren't you glad it is the gift he made you to be so even when children go home to heaven they will not miss their destiny their destiny has not been stolen from them because their ultimate destiny is to grow up and be the gift he put in them their gifts are their gifts and callings are irrevocable and they will step into that and use that in heaven so if you're if you're one of those who's lost a baby or lost a child or a youth don't sit there and think that their whole life was taken away from them they're living in the most glorious place having the most fun they've ever had with friends going all over heaven without parental guidance isn't that the best of the best going places doing things with jesus he has all of your children he has all of your babies they're filled with life they laugh they play even they get to create things the greatest levels of creativity and technology are in heaven and some of those technologies that i saw in heaven are literally going to be in this earth because this is the time for heaven to invade the earth people are saying things they don't understand how powerful that is what they're saying heaven is coming to earth heaven is invading the earth do we say that on earth as it is in heaven is one of the most profound statements anyone is making because that's a lifestyle it's a culture it's not just sounding good your will being done on earth as is in heaven is a culture it's a way of life called heaven culture so we who are alive now get to live in a way never lived before because this is the time where we will manifest demonstrate speak to the earth the sky the sea it'll be healed because of the glory we carry we'll step into time and go forward in time we'll see things forward in time we won't be bound by time or space because christ wasn't and everything i say will point right back to him the things he did we will do but you have to get your head get your head and put it on the shelf and open your spirit realize he said greater than so he actually saved the best for us to do so get off your rapturog roll it up and stick it in the closet the holy spirit laughs every time i say that because that's the first place i heard i heard him say it to me when i was saying were people trying to figure out and figure out in their natural mind everything that was being said i said you don't get revelation that way your spirit receives the things of the spirit so if you're if you're sitting there trying to figure out the first one you missed all the rest of them revelation is sent by god and there's different revelations he sends for certain times on the earth so you're hearing new things you've never heard about before or it wouldn't be revelation so i'm not going to be normal i'm not going to look normal i'm not going to say normal things that would be the same oh samo and god's not old he is new all the time so if you're going to hear about heaven it should be things you never thought of or heard of before but not just in heaven but on this earth the greater works he's not coming to rescue people and take them out here we haven't even done the greater works we're still trying to do the first works so god has given revelation on many things that we know are in the word but we don't necessarily have understanding so he's revealing mysteries i love his mysteries when he gives me one i get someone done like a little kid why didn't i see that why didn't i think of it that way why didn't i see it that way and he said because your thoughts aren't my thoughts but you can have my thoughts and you need to walk in my ways i didn't realize how many times it said that in the word even in the old testament he was telling people you need to walk in my ways you need to know my ways because they're not man's ways his are different they're unusual they're amazing fantastic life-changing they'll get you undone just like isaiah got undone i know how he felt when he had that experience you have no words to even say anything about it when you stand before him when you see that throne you see the living creatures massive and huge with thousands of eyes in their body and in their wings worshiping them continually the throne room is round the throne goes up like this like a pyramid with different levels and the throne is at the top that's why satan stole that image yeah almost everything he's told anything he says is his he stole it that throne goes up like levels and there's columns and levels and columns and levels but all goes like this and the throne is high and lifted up and there's four sets of steps that go up to the throne people are all over them gifts are all over them for the lord and for the father just gifts thrown up the steps the river of life flowing down these steps people are laying at the bottom drinking it sometimes he floods the throne room with it and you're swimming in it sometimes he opens the throne room floor and you literally see the river of life that goes down the streets of gold and then people jump in it it's a structure there's rooms under the throne that are under the altar where the souls go in there and they're under the altar crying out and we've always pictured them like here's the altar you know i know what altars look like and i've always pictured people crammed underneath these altars like how many can you fit because it says they cry out under the altar but that's because the altar is up here by his throne and there's rooms that you go into under the throne and even people go in there to clear over their families and people go in there and they they declare they worship they they say things over their families they bless their families but there's people in there always crying out for justice and if you ever walked up the steps of the throne they're very high very wide i clearly can so clearly embedded in my mind is the word justice like this big it's one of the steps of the throne justice is one of the biggest things we're going to get in this time as the body of christ justice against what the devil has done to us for generations and generations and generations [Music] to unseat him from where he put himself the righteous have learned he has no right to be there we were given dominion in the earth he was not he took it christ won it back for us so we're supposed to be like him we're supposed to be different we're supposed to be powerful we should be fierce against the darkness because the violent take it by force not the lazy not the ignorant not the ones who don't care the violent from the time of john the baptist that wild man who was shouting in the wilderness repent of your sins you wicked people the kingdom of heaven is a hand repent and get baptized in water do you know how weird that was you talk about bizarre at least i don't wear camel hair [Laughter] what time what oh no but my husband has threatened to buy me a camel costume so every time someone says god does not use pink hair i show up with the camel okay would you rather see this or the pink hair i've had many pastors say god does not do things like that he wouldn't do that you know you need to know him more because i know what the word says and at least he's not trying to tell me to walk around naked for two years sleep on one side turn it over sleep and cook my food on dung pink hair is a lot better and you know what they can't fight against the word i think john wore camel here is that correct well that was for that time no and that way god never changes he always does weird things to his prophets because he doesn't hide them he makes sure you don't ever forget them this is a marketing ploy for heaven right here and it works i get people saved on the plane in the airport security check-in tsa i get favor all the time in the airport because i declare i do people even the security people walking through the airport recognize me now they'll walk past me really quiet and they'll just kind of edge me over like they're going to interrogate me or something they do they come up with their badges and everything they get me over where no one kisses them they go so what is god showing you from heaven and then they'll just walk with me wherever i'm going they're walking me so uh it's okay um and they'll say i know you're busy and i know you got a plane to catch so you can just talk to me while we're walking while we're walking it's quite fun because they recognize the pink hair you can't hide one day this will be normal because heaven's invading earth and everyone in heaven at one time or another has highlights in their hair if they have a big celebration in the throne room everybody puts highlights in their hair they do it with light think really hard about doing that it's heaven culture because it's strange but i can't tell you how many people have said i love your pink hair and it opens a conversation about jesus christ that they didn't expect so i leave them in their soul with words they never expected to hear that he asked me to have this in person so the world would know he loved them and so i'm not bashing them or accusing them or threatening them i'm giving them life and they will never forget that [Applause] and guess what it's too late to escape because the anointing's already going into them and the anointing breaks uh so pink hair let you really see anointing green hair blue hair purple hair whatever they even put diamond dust in your hair in heaven it's beautiful isn't it and some people are so afraid to receive revelation and yet or they want well i like a cafeteria it's a cafeteria i'll take these revelations but these are just too wild i don't want them this is just too far out no i don't think that's god and when you miss him when you do that because if he's anointed someone to speak on his behalf and they live what they speak you should pay attention if they're sharing deception or if they're living unrighteously trying to tell you things from god i wouldn't take anything from them because their their souls been twisted either to live in deception and believe it and share it and you can tell deception they always end up by saying that you don't need jesus christ no matter what they start with it's an anti-christ spirit all the false religions are an antichrist spirit but the deception that is so released now into mainly into the body of christ because the world doesn't care the world wouldn't need the deception they don't know christ anyway so he's hitting the body of christ with deception and it sounds really good and even plausible because people can take the scriptures and make anything out of them and it can appear that it doesn't matter whether you sin or not you know or that god loves everybody so much the earth and the fullness thereof is here so he's taking everyone to heaven they'll actually use that scripture for that that's not what the word says or they'll say there is no satan there's there's beings like him but there is no real literal satan well then jesus was blinded when he was encountering them on the mountain of temptation he talked about him he was kicked out of heaven there is a being and i've seen him also and his eyes are filled with death but he's not red he doesn't have a pitchfork or a pointed tail i think that image is to make him look sort of like a cartoon but he's not he's deadly he hates everyone even his own demons he hates them he loves nothing or no one and his greatest desire is to take everyone to hell so we need to be fierce about winning people of course but in this day we have a greater revelation to do things in more powerful ways and accelerate it like be free stay free of everything by losing stuff from your soul the keys to the kingdom which you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven you don't have to keep not even a care if you realize that you're having a care you've been being concerned about stuff and then it goes into worry and then it can actually turn into sadness or even levels of grief or despair you don't want that in your soul so if i even realize that i'm sad i will loose that sadness from my soul i won't keep it you don't have to keep it we cast all our cares on christ one of my favorite scriptures another one is luke 2 52 and jesus increased in wisdom and stature in favor favor favor favor with god and man is that what it says yeah then we need to be doing that don't we when we take the word as truth absolute truth and we begin to apply that to our life you'll see your life change even if you didn't have revelation on it and you just start applying the word not just reading it it's a life book it's a book the way to live your life but when we start applying what we're reading he then gives us revelation so we can go from glory to glory we have weapons we have been given spiritual weapons not earthly weapons we're not supposed to fight against people everybody say that we do not war against the flesh so why do we do it because we're listening to the enemy he wants to keep us busy fighting so we will never come together because then we will be deadly he wants you dangerous but when you begin to come together and operate and rule and reign we will be deadly to the plans of the enemy will crush darkness push it out of whole regions he's going to have a miserable life [Applause] i want him miserable i want him terrified he's been doing that to us long enough christ didn't walk in fear i love the scripture fear not take no thought for your life if he holds it in his hand and you're running after him then nothing can take you out of his hand if he takes you home you're still in his hand [Applause] it says the grave and death they have no victory right and people go well we'll know each other in heaven no no death shouldn't even touch you in your thoughts life should be there not death to be spiritually minded is life so if you're focused on life and living and giving life and helping people to live and be greater and do greater then death will be far from you i love what he said about john when he said what is it to you if i let him remain till i come back they couldn't even kill him he's a good example of living life and sharing life the first words out of his mouth was always about life and love his last great message love one another they didn't want to hear they want to hear mighty mysteries they want to hear more revelations of heaven but they brought him out on the litter what did he say love one another we need to do that more too the more we focus on living and being something and doing something for god we're agreeing with him when you agree with him that is powerful the world should see as powerful they should see us loving helping and caring one another even more than we do the world it says to consider those of the household of faith first does it say that then we need to stop fighting each other lay down your differences you're going to live in heaven you'll wish you did it sooner i'm speaking to the pastors not just the body you're the example of god in your church start acting like him don't put fear in your people don't tell them the end is coming buy see rations and run to the hills tell them to get rid of the rapture rug let god decide when that happens get your crown on start reaching out to each other and caring cross those denominational lines or just wipe them out completely [Music] when the fire god begins to hit you you're not going to care what the name of your church is [Applause] the fire of god and the fear of the lord will hit you at the same time you crawl on your knees to love one another because you can't stand up you forget what you were fighting about christ set a wonderful example of loving people especially his disciples he gave me a whole new picture of them god took me back and let me see a life a day in the life of christ with his mary man now this was like in the first year he was with them when he was still having to tolerate them the sons of thunder there was a reason why they called him that they weren't calling fire and lightning down from heaven they were creating it on the earth because they fought over pretty girls they were so full of themselves they liked themselves a lot and competed a lot even while they were walking down the road to take the truth in the gospel behind the messiah luke the great physician all his patients were chasing him down the road why did you abandon us you left us for him we need you you took care of us we need we need you we we need you to take care of us we're sick don't you care about us and they're all hobbling down the road after luke the tax collector they were throwing rocks in him you better duck they didn't like him at all so here's jesus with this these these people that god had given him you ever felt that way about the god the people god sent you god sent to you are you sure because i don't think it sounds like you it doesn't look like what i thought it would look like i have to pray even harder for my own staff can you open their ears so they can hear simple things [Music] then when you think you got it made they're all together he adds some more that were harder than the first ones he sent you and god said i didn't make it easy on my son that's why he ran to the mountain to be with his father all the time don't you ever feel like you got to get away christ's dead and on top of that his family was always pursuing him this is not what we thought you would be doing are you done when are you coming home they didn't want him for his revelation they didn't even want him for the miracles he did i know they probably never asked him where did you hear that that's amazing wow you raised the dad are you coming home to make more wine from heaven now we gotta work your carpentry business it's going to the dogs don't you care about it does this sound like family and jesus knew he was going to be about his father's business and he didn't go back home do you realize sometimes they actually lived with him when they traveled so it wasn't like just going down the road he had to listen to when they all got together at the end of the day and in the beginning what they said wasn't good i know when you live positively and deal with life and someone starts talking negativity it's like crushing you it says don't be the friends of an angry man there's a reason for that you're going to get filled your soul get filled with it well if you live with someone who's negative every word that comes out of the mouth is negative you begin to you cannot bear it okay i taught all my family to lose stuff you better lose it because if you don't i'm gonna know it if you didn't ask for grace for that day that's gonna show up too no wonder jesus had to be filled with god's grace as a child it says so in the word as a child he filled him with his grace god has grace it's the abundant life grace that's at his throne of grace christ came to bring life grace for eternal life but he also was allowed to impart abundant life because as a child his father filled him with abundant life therefore he can impart it but god gives you infusion with you can impart it he knew he's going to need that grace to live with those men and yet look how powerful they changed the world didn't they they became exactly what he wanted them to become took a while but they had it in their soul they saw him he was mentoring them for three years gave his life and so their his life into their lives and was excited when they began to travel through the spirit realm like philip and where john became love he didn't just share love he became love he was saturated with love that's why he said the one that christ loved he didn't even give his name sometimes he talked about love poured love into people all the time that's why people were drawn to him after christ was gone he actually believed when he went to the tomb you know why he was the closest one to jesus he would not be apart from him he wanted to hear every word he said oh wow i can't believe time went by that fast the closer you get to christ the more you're going to become like him we cannot lead jesus out of anything that we're doing you wouldn't have any rights to do any of this you can't be a commander but we can't because he was a commander we can't be a creator but the father and he both were creators we can be creators we are over time because they were over time we're over the weather because christ was over the weather he didn't mind demonstrating he was trying to teach his disciples to do that we can multiply food i've already done that at a funeral he has connected me too he's so connected me to life after death no one can ever tell me there's not life after death there's more life after death than you had down here that's why we have to live on earth as they live in heaven so people can see life in us [Applause] christ was the lord of hosts this is my last thing i want to share with you it's about engaging with the army of heaven i love the song we're supposed to engage with the army people think that's just too weird we're not supposed to have anything i've heard something you're not supposed to worship angels do you know where that came from back in the day when the angels were sent watcher angels were sent to help educate mankind god put them here because he had no one on the earth to represent him they had severed the relationship with god so he couldn't teach him himself like he was teaching adam he literally put there's a whole tribe of angels called watch your angels they all have flesh melchizedek is the head of that tribe he also is the father's personal high priest he has always existed he wasn't someone who lived on the earth died and went to heaven became melchizedek i know people believe that even some of the jewish tribes believe that he was someone who you know walked on the earth but it said he has no father no mother no beginning nor end so there's still mysteries we need to know about but the hosts were created to protect us to guard us to keep us in all our ways part of that taking power over all the part of the enemy is using the host of heaven that army was created by the father in detailed tribes fierce they become weapons they ship shape from their person into weapons when they go and fight the demonic but he didn't need them to guard heaven he was on the throne so why did he make them they waited for ages to actually do what they're created to do to be weapons in our hands they those weapons they are mighty they literally can get ahold of the strongholds and pull them down we rule by what we say by the way we live our life like christ did he was a commander and the lord of hosts when he spoke they did it does christ live in you if we do the works he did and greater works than he did those angels were created for this time and day we live in for those who run in the kingdom who live in the kingdom who rule in the kingdom in that spiritual kingdom there is a spiritual army at our call walking is a man a righteous man on the earth christ said to the religious hierarchy if i wanted to i could call the army of heaven to come and fight on my behalf are we joint heirs of all that he had or did then why would that leave them out that's good they are bored there was a time and day on this earth that god said that said from this point on they will command an army like my son commanded an army because they are joint heirs i have created them to protect them keep them and all the way till one day they won't even dash their foot upon a rock and nothing by any means shall harm them you can fight against this revelation argue about it this is something from the father you invite heaven's army to be your weapon like you invited christ to be your savior and by the holy spirit to indwell you heaven protocol you have to invite they don't just come on their own generally in the past when we all pray in groups they could come and do some things in general areas but this is the time for us to be fierce to be focused to crush the plans of the enemy to have power over every single power of the enemy and they are a weapon your weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds you need to pursue that you can say i don't want it and not do it but in this day of what's coming on this earth they will protect you and keep you i have not been attacked at all from the day the father came and taught me how to invite heaven's army as a weapon and then give them orders to bring destruction to the plains the enemy to pull down strongholds wherever i go send them before i go somewhere so that nothing will hinder me haunt me or get in my way you can think about it pray about it but i know about revelation you don't just hear it you do it the work of the lord you don't just hear it you do it when you rule and reign you don't talk about it you do it if you're going to be violent against the enemy you can't just keep it inside and go i'm so upset and angry you do something about it so stand up i'm going to pray over all of you father i declare and decree that these children of you're standing here today that you open their ears to hear clearly spiritual ears open their eyes their spiritual eyes to see clearly in clarity let them see the host around them let them see them in the sky let them see them sitting beside them let them see carrying out orders because they were sent from headquarters [Music] by the lord of hosts who was their chief commander because he was a commander we are supposed to be commanders god said command ye me he didn't say beg yes this is our father i declare they will stand up and they will command they will rule there will be destruction they will push back darkness they will handle the wealth of the wicked they will get revelation they will have encounters they will not be the same because we are a new creation we'll be a sign and a wonder to this world because we won't be normal [Applause] i thank you father as people today choose to invite heaven's army if you want to say i choose with my will [Music] to be like christ i invite heaven's army sent by the lord of hosts to be one of my

thought i would talk a little bit and then maybe jen could come up with some questions because you know we get them all the time either about heaven or something else but um yeah i'm so filled with god right now after doing that interview it was very powerful and so i thought i'd talk some more about the restart of america which is still continuing and i know some places is a little bit slower than others uh we're having really a great response from our governor here in florida so we're really excited about that we're praying for others who aren't really maybe getting the same response from theirs just remember on election day who you vote for next time and i just want to encourage you that that we're hearing more and more things are being reopened and then the reopening is being expanded to like more people able to attend and stuff like that i don't think they're quite ready to do mass crowds meeting together for big events and stuff like that so i'm sure a lot of people are being affected by that i'm sure that that was not easy for any of them and i know many people try different things like drive-by church you know online church was amazing yay dede and david in colorado at um up on lookout mountain they did a great job i think they broadcasted every single night since the quarantine happened they're still doing it and they're still doing it and that would be um gateway on mount zion gateway on mount zion online you can go yeah their facebook page or their website their website in uh yeah gateway on mount zion in golden colorado they're really powerful and i know there were many others who do that i just happen to know that they are one of them and let me tell you god is going to be really be visiting places it was a wonderful thing the day the holy spirit invaded our earth and let me tell you he is my best friend make sure you know him well he will share things with you to come he'll give revelation on the word of god he'll tweak your life all day long and jen and i both know he does that with us he'll even go shopping with you and tell you the best deals to get and honestly i'll even go to get something like i want to pick apples out he'll actually tell me don't get those get these other ones are going to taste better it depends on how much you open yourself up to him you know he's the third member of passing that's what god's been saying is just going to pass on and there will be no second wave he has assured me of that many times so i hope that encourages some people and i know in other countries people really also been praying to god for many things that they need help with and we pray for people all the time to be touched by god to be ministered for resources to come for help to come to different people and you know i know to some people it looks like utterly impossible don't say it's impossible you need to stay with god all things are possible and begin to thank him for the things you need if you've been praying and asking him that's fine but start thanking him for these things it says call those things that be not as though they were that means you talk about them like they're already here that's called faith so i want to encourage everybody i hope your faith has been increased during this time and i know this is something probably most people will never forget of course there'll be generations coming behind us that don't know anything about that but i think this has been a very different time and and hopefully the best part of you has come out during this time don't forget to pray and reach out to others there are many people who we may have less of things but let me tell you there's some that have nothing and my dad's heart was always to help those kind of people we spent years and years helping people feeding them finding them clothes finding them jobs finding houses for them that was just put in me and so that's my heart is to be help people be generous you know and sometimes be generous even when you need something yourself that touches the heart of god when you give out of your own need it really does touch god's heart and i know that right now he's got great things prepared for all of us i just finished saying that in our interview with steve schultz of elijah's i'm going to encourage everyone out there if you are not signed up to elijah list.com you need to go do that because he has the proven prophets you'll hear words from prophets some you know some you don't know and then you can watch and see what god does once they have spoken and declare things he's had me on there several times just discussing things prophesying things god has said and he won't let people come on there if all they want to do is bash and bring doom and gloom and death and destruction this is not the time for that to happen in this earth these are the greater days of god and so i really want to encourage you keep declaring that the restart operation restart will be fully taking place and that people will be able to go back to somewhat of a normal life i hope it's not going to be normal as far as god is concerned i hope you've increased your relationship with your family and with him and then get ready for some awesome things to begin to happen for all of us and that we also pray for people in other countries god i thank you for helping to bring supply to those countries that don't have supply we speak against and take authority over any of the virus right now we won't tolerate the virus even anywhere on the earth in jesus name we are over sickness and disease we are not under it christ was never upset he was never controlled by any form of sickness or disease when he walked down this earth and you shouldn't either he didn't have to put up with lack okay with violence he didn't have to put up with um any forms of oppression or depression he didn't keep in him and he didn't participate with it and make sure you're saying that yourself there's people out there right now if you're oppressed don't tolerate it loose it out of your soul get rid of it don't let it control you don't let fear control you because this is not going to drag on for years and years and why am i saying that because i was in the grocery store the other day and the person just you know just ringing up my my supplies they were saying that their self oh i just think this is going to last for years what are we going to do we don't have any kind of a life and i said well that is not correct this is for a very short time it's going to pass and then your life will begin to increase again so anywhere i can give hope or encouragement to people i'm going to do that that's what we're supposed to do and so thank you for all your prayers and all you guardians i want to thank you so much for your support you have blessed our hearts you've blessed the heart of god every chance i get i'm going to make sure i thank them and we have so many more things coming we have other broadcasts right coming up more programs coming up right now that we're designing and creating so today because we have some extra time in the the studio is all set up we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and answer some questions i think jen has some questions that she can ask me we've been trying to figure out why the internet was sticking so and i do know you know that we've had some issues here techno you know with some of the technical stuff here that i don't understand yeah i don't understand that at all i just know that i know how to talk and so that's my part and we do take authority over and we're not towering the enemy getting in any of our systems frequencies technology whatever it is we're kicking him out in jesus name because i know people are probably out there praying now i'm in agreement with every one of you and so we want to have a great broadcast and a signal to be strong in jesus name so what do you have today jen for a question well i just asked everybody on facebook can i play the intro oh yeah oh we're gonna we're gonna do a short q a so we're gonna let you see our little intro we're gonna so okay we're ready for our q a but before we start i already have a question that i was asked the other day and jen just reminded me people are asking about our 2020 calendar i know the year is almost half over but this isn't just about the months or the days of the months this is about revealing heaven and these calendars we create are what god wants he wants to reveal heaven to the earth the spirit realm to the earth the host of heaven the army of heaven whatever it is he once revealed that's part of our job to reveal heaven to earth and so they want to know about our calendar because we've been talking about it lately there's some fun activities in there that you can do with us that interact with us and one happens to be this month that's how this whole thing started this is the calendar right here i hope you can see it it's called the world called heaven and on the cover is an actual picture of a place that exists in heaven we all know about hebrews 12 1 that talks about the great cloud of witnesses that are watching this from heaven this is one of the places they do that this is called the portal and they have them all over heaven people come in way here this is the doorway walk down here they walk up steps these are steps that go up here to this opening you can see the opening right there and that's where people look down in they can view the earth declare over the loved ones see things happening good things happening on the earth and they sing they go and sing to you on your birthday they they understand they get to see weddings and babies being born and all kinds of things like that so this is a beautiful place that's mentioned in the bible i was taken to that place and so this entire calendar actually that's what this is about and every month you see a place or a being that is in heaven and i'll show you one more and uh but we have special days we put in here we put some of our own days in here what is not in here is satan's holiday you won't see that okay we're not giving him any place whatsoever uh and so let me find one of the other places there's so many i want to show you this is just awesome and most of these places were places i personally was taken to in heaven here's one of somebody going home to heaven this is called the transport and this woman who you can see standing there with the red hair she was 90 in her 90s when she passed and when she stepped her spiritual body stepped out of her body this is what she looked like young and happy she's very happy those are her two guardian angels about to take her home to heaven and then over here you'll find an explanation at the bottom of the picture over here you'll find an explanation of what this picture is about so you you get understanding not just images and then like i said and at the bottom of every month we have a declaration that we make like here this one says heaven celebrates each time a believer comes home so you get this at the end of each calendar month we make a declaration like that for you so it's very exciting you will see places in heaven you never even dreamed were there we do still have some left but the reason people want them is because we have interactive days like we have a day we said uh tell people you know show us with you wearing angel wings and that was one of the days and but you have to use the email email address that is on the calendar for those interactive things we do still have some left so maybe for the next month or so we'll have some so you can find them on revealingheaven.com go to our website click on the store and you'll see this calendar there uh we are already in the in the we are already right now creating to the 2021 calendar and the one before this one which was 2019 was about the host of heaven we we revealed and introduced heaven's army into the earth because the father had asked us to do that and so there's many other things in here i'll show you one more this is called the hall of knowledge i'm not the only one who's been there there's these beautiful towers made out of emerald like they look like emerald glass you ride on roads of light through these towers and that you can learn all kinds of different things the books actually show you the book you would take the book out of the niche and you lay it on this little table and it opens up and shows you like a movie of what's in the book this is heaven this is not the earth so if you're interested make sure you go to revealingheaven.com you can ask for on the web store on the web store and then you can find the world called heaven calendar and they need to click on the correct link that pertains to where they live there's a link for canada there's a link for the us and then there's a link for all other countries because you know we ship internationally around the world and they have different costs for different um for shipping and so that's why it's important you click on the right one so your calendar is not sent to the wrong country and so there you go there's a little bit of information from a question that we got so what do you have next jen um i have a question from eagle eagle and um they asked can our loved ones visit us in our dreams how can our loved ones visit us in our dreams the loved ones from heaven eyes and right yes that happens to many people people have very vivid dreams and i would have to say absolutely that does happen god speaks to people and visions and dreams it says so in the bible so that is possible for you to have a dream or even a vision of your loved one in heaven and actually some people have been caught up to heaven while they were sleeping and didn't realize that and they have very vivid dreams of being in heaven with their loved ones so you know with god those things are possible but absolutely that is possible for that to happen and sometimes it will happen like right after somebody passes away um i've heard of some people just appearing briefly in the room and waving sometimes they don't say anything sometimes they just say i want you know i'm okay or i love you and i think that depends on getting permission from the father for them to get permission from the father to do that i know people are so undone and overwhelmed when they first get to heaven their whole head and heart is just trying to take in that glorious place of splendor in heaven and of course the relationships they have with people they are meeting the father and the son and holy spirit just seeing the beauty that's there the things you prepare for them their own mansion they're just getting undone it's like one gift every time they go somewhere else it's something beautiful but yes i do believe it's possible to have dreams and visions okay um i found this question almost quite well not really humorous so it's it's a good one it's from dawn and she said cat do angels ever mess up like when someone gets in an accident or something is that them maybe not paying attention or slacking off on their job lol just always wondered about that i don't think it's about an angel if an angel messed up it wouldn't be something to do with rescuing somebody or protecting somebody i think so many different circumstances issues in our own lives you know the enemy will try to attack anywhere that he can make sure you're declaring and decreeing against that happening make sure that you're involving the army of heaven in your life um make sure there's all kinds of things so i have to say for sure angels don't mess up on something that would be that important they probably you know you have to realize these are real these beings have real personalities like you and i they all have souls they all have emotions and so i think sometimes maybe they're not quite getting along especially on an assignment i think they would get maybe a harder assignment given to them i do know sometimes that does happen i don't know how often but like i said some people have stronger personalities some have really fun personalities i know that there's some angels that are almost like comedians and there's others who are very focused and fierce against the enemy and that whatever their personality is that that's definitely going to come out in their assignments that god gives them of course they're answerable to him the thing about being an angel is nothing is hidden god definitely knows everything that's going on with them and they live with him so i think he has to handle that stuff and i know um we always have new people that come in or people that haven't heard you talk about stuff and people who've heard you say this stuff a million times but it's like certain people need to hear it and i really feel like um i want to ask this question this is from pam and she said you may have addressed this already please forgive me if it's a redundant i am a nurse you've mentioned we will do the same work in heaven there isn't any sickness or lack in heaven we all that um i know i've done on earth uh let's see what will i do for papa god if my job won't be needed well it's not your job it's not your job that you do in heaven nobody has a job it says actually says you labor no more what you do for a living is not what you'll be doing in heaven unless you've been using the gift he put in you let's say someone who's a recording artist and they're singing and they're so anointed they will be doing that in heaven but they'll be doing it for everybody in heaven for free so it's probably your hobby or something that is your passion uh maybe even though you were a nurse and you took care of people of course there is absolutely no sickness in heaven whatsoever they don't need lawyers doctors nurses there's all kinds of things they just don't need them in heaven because that stuff doesn't exist there but somewhere in you he put a natural gift not a job okay those are skills i'm not talking even about skills skills can be learned but a gift is something he puts in you and that's the thing you love to do the most that's how you can tell what it is it says every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights that would be you and when he made you in your little spirit man he placed in that spirit man a gift whether it is an artist whether it is a dancer whether you're going to sing whether you're going to grow the best flowers ever whether you're gonna make the best i don't know chimichangas uh donuts whatever it is the culinary arts are absolutely i don't know where that came from somebody probably likes them i don't like them whatever whatever okay baker's bakers are loved in heaven because let me tell you he gives you your own shop everything you make it all make all the wonderful stuff there's no gluten free no weight gain i can just go on and on yeah none of this stuff you don't have to have keto you don't have to eat keto stuff at the same time and so they're let me tell you there's fried chicken there's pizza i've been to a pizza parlor and haven't had ice cream cones and everyone that's their gift because that was their passion on the earth and they knew that it says your gifts and your callings are without repentance and he will not take irrevocable means he'll never take it away that means if he put in you to be an artist yes and maybe you never actually had a gallery or anything like that but maybe all you want to do is sketch you're a great sketch artist maybe you you understand colors and stuff like that maybe you want to make pottery with your hands but you don't do that for a living but it's your passion that's your gift it's what your passion is maybe it was a drummer and one grandson he started drumming on everything before he was a year old we knew he was going to be a drummer guess what he still loves it that's his gift when he goes to heaven one day he'll be a drummer that's not a job you don't have to labor it's not something that you don't like it's not something that's hard it's like breathing you love it so much so guess what and all that i do and all that jen does we are photographers my gift is i'm not going to be a revelator in heaven okay i'm not going to be a prophet in heaven i'm not going to be those things i'm not going to be any minister i'm not going to do that i will be a photographer why because i love it it is my passion from the time i was little i'd make fake little cameras with a box and pretend i was taking pictures until i got my first camera and i have never stopped loving it i already know in heaven i'll have a studio come by and see me one day when you get there i'll take your pictures for free and create beautiful stuff out of that so that's what you'll do whatever your hobby is whatever your passion is it's in there somewhere that's what you will be and all your property will be designed that's why there's amusement parks there's rodeos there's all kinds of wonderful fun things there and every time someone comes home to heaven there's something new and exciting to do but they're not working they're not laboring it is the most fun they've ever had in their life so there that's a good answer for those people who don't know they keep sitting on the pew their church this is what god says all my people keep sitting on the pew of their church trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is and yet the thing i want them to know the most is what is their natural gift that i made them when i sent them to the earth because when you get home to heaven that'll be the most exciting thing you do there yep okay one more what's one more okay um i've been screen shotting questions okay um back to uh the when you were talking about the angels um this one person didn't quite understand her her name is i want to say remy home um she said how could they not get along there is no evil in the angels so i guess she does she thinks they fight no no no i'm not talking about fighting like evil there is no evil there is no hate they don't do that in heaven but they have personalities everybody has a personality okay and you have to understand angels are spiritual beings we're physical beings okay we both have a soul but we have to make our we all get to make our own decisions because you're a believer and you're going to heaven doesn't mean you always you don't ever have disagreements with people okay there is no anger no coveting there's no jealousy in heaven there's no wrath nobody fights nobody hits somebody nobody does things spiteful i'm not talking about that kind of stuff i forget sometimes to relate things my answers to heaven culture and not earth culture so your mind is thinking earth culture earth atmosphere earth living it's not like that in heaven but not everybody wants the same thing even in heaven but they still agree to enjoy their self to have fun you still have your favorite things your favorite colors in heaven that god doesn't take all that away from you but there is no anger no wrath no hating no spitefulness no coveting there's no offense that part that part of your your flesh emotions because right now we're spirit man but we still have our flesh when he talks about your flesh lay down your flesh right that's not talking about you dying as a person that's talking about your opinions your rights your attitudes your anger issues that's the flesh that stuff is not there but people still have their personalities their likes or dislikes and sometimes when angels are sent on assignment god on purpose and this is why he does it there's no marriage between the angels they don't get married on this earth we get married and one of the things that he does with marriages sharpens the husband and wife that doesn't mean get you angry enough that you divorce but it stretches us right it makes us to come into agreement on different things sometimes you know we have to give a little take to get you know we have to come together in agreement even as husband and wife but it stretches it says steal sharpen steel that's what happens when you're married you sharpen each other you make each other care more understand things aren't going to be perfect but you're you're willing to work it out in heaven they don't have that so god has another way that the angels get stretched right and he sends different personalities on assignment and i happen to know this is true because two that were assigned to me for a while one was a comedian the other one was so fierce against darkness he wanted to talk about being holy he wanted to talk about crushing the enemy that would be satan his plans the other one wanted to make jokes because he was funny his personality was totally opposite of the southern angels they stretched each other every time they were with me they didn't get angry each other so forget about the anger thing that's earth thinking but angels have personalities in heaven and they like many different things and they have friends amongst each other no romance okay they don't happen in heaven um the angels who fell tried that it didn't work so that's what i'm talking about when i said you know it's not like your flesh getting involved i'm talking about on the earth when you loosen stuff from your soul get grace for that day and you work through your things you don't get offended you don't get in wrath um because we have help from heaven okay one more next question angel question and then i have a question i have a 13 year old um wow melissa wants to know do we have the same guardian angel our whole life yes you have the same guardian angel your entire life at the time you are conceived when life begins life doesn't begin when a baby's born life begins the time of conception and from that moment your angel your guardian angel or angels are sent from heaven they are will you your entire life they are the ones who help bring you home to heaven when your body dies and your spiritual body steps out the first one you will see normally will be your guardian angels and they escort you home in a transport all different ways you can be taken chariots you can be taken to heaven they will be with you the whole time awesome okay um charity's 13 year old daughter her name is i want to say lyanna but she would like to know can we ever get kicked out of heaven no but he's going to get kicked out of heaven that only happened once and that would be satan and all the angels who fell with him they were the only ones who'd been kicked out of heaven all right they decided to go against god to try to take over heaven that was a long time ago and so he was one third of all the angels in heaven how about that that's crazy chose satan chose lucifer as their new leader and they all got kicked out but no one who goes there you're not going to get kicked out of heaven okay when you step out of your physical body with your spiritual body you already whatever things whatever issues you had whether it was anger against somebody or you had issues maybe you didn't even like yourself all that is gone okay those things you don't carry up to heaven the people you cared about the gifts he put in you to use that stuff remains with you and excitement adventure and all kinds of wonderful things are in heaven but you can't get kicked out of heaven because when you receive jesus christ as your savior all the stuff all the sins in you get wiped away like they never happen don't let the enemy remind you of your sins if you repented of them all right now even god can remember them because you told him that you were sorry for them and so i can assure you that no one's going to get kicked out of heaven okay and um this is another one you've answered before but i love to hear you talk about this um erica's brother she didn't say what his name was but he wants to know if there is hunting in heaven this is a fun answer actually that's why i asked it i think you know jen knows a lot because she's heard so many probably she's probably heard every single time i went to heaven and for those of you who don't know me yes god has never stopped catching me up to heaven yes he can do that because he wants to no i don't choose to go myself this is all free for all of you so you understand god caught people up to heaven in the old testament it says so he caught people up to heaven in the new testament without dying and he still does that because he chooses to and so she knows just about every time he caught me up not in this physical body it would stay behind you catch me my spirit man my spiritual body that looked just like me but a lot better and so what was the question erica's brother now if there's hunting in heaven is there hunting in heaven you'd be surprised what god has uh has in heaven but it's the way he does it this different okay almost everything we have on the earth is in heaven except there's no killing no no harm nobody gets injured uh none of that happens in heaven okay so um i'm getting distracted today is there like are you seeing angels well there are angels all over in here right now okay of course i could get distracted just by the one that's behind me and the one who's two on here the one standing by you the one standing by chris okay the one's sticking their heads with the ceiling looking down and the ones looking through i'm gonna figure oh yes because you know i don't really want to hunt maybe well no we won't say that i don't hunt i don't want to hurt anything maybe mosquitoes there's hunting in heaven but this is the way god does it because nothing gets killed remember what i said no creatures are killed all animals are called creatures in heaven they all talk they all have actually uh amazing personalities but you do go to the mountain of spices that actually exist in heaven and what you do is a camera shoot you're capturing the image and they actually have a clubhouse in this whole place and you will be hunted by the creatures with their own cameras while you're hunting them and your goal when you get to heaven is to be the first one to get their picture which is sent back to this huge clubhouse with like a 40-50 foot screen and down in the corner is the one who captured you and on the screen is the one that was captured and so all these people i actually saw people in heaven doing that they had you know pack horses and they were packing all their camera equipment on these horses they even have different type cameras that look like sort of like a scope thing and when you some of these creatures are not anywhere on the earth by the way so you're really hunting something that's fantastic but more times than not when you get back to the clubhouse you will see your face plastered all over the big screen and in the corner will be the creature who captured you by getting that picture first so it's very intense because while you're hunting to find the creatures to get their pictures it's a camera shoot remember you're not gonna hurt anything but how intense is that hunting process when you're looking for something that's never been seen before and yet they're probably smarter than you they hide to you and they get you first when you go back thinking wow i know i snapped that picture and you walk in the clubhouse and there's your face plastered all over you know that you were busted and you were caught not them but the intensity and excitement even increases more so in heaven but nobody gets hurt or harmed and no life is taken so you will still get to do that try your best if you can when you get there okay i have a um another question you've talked about before but um holy spirit really wants me to ask this so um do aborted babies and babies in general have their own mansions especially when they grow up or if not where do they live i brought this everybody everyone no matter who they are will eventually have their own mansion jesus said in my father's house that's a world by the way just you understand god's house is the world called heaven bigger than our galaxy and uh trust me there's plenty of room for mansions and when little babies go home to having every baby who dies passes leaves this earth with however you want to say it whether through abortion miscarriage or because they were sick or whatever if when they die and they go home to heaven they will know family members in heaven uh they will grow very slowly uh we've actually know of people who when they were 40 years old died on the operating table saw their seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold who died years before that but because they the the mother went in her spiritual body her son recognized him he still looked seven years old he was playing with friends on the streets of gold and he recognized her and actually told her you can't stay you have to go back but god allowed her to see her son number one he was well and whole he was happy he was playing he had friends and his mom came back of course she survived her operation and for years her and her husband would travel around the world and tell people about the beauty and the love of god that their child was still waiting on them in heaven now she's already home in heaven so when the parent comes home to the baby they actually get to take the baby from the nurseries and i have a picture here's one of the nursery walls that i saw in heaven right here and i gotta make sure that the lights not reflecting tilt it down oh here yeah there we go that's good if you can see that these are some of the babies beds that were on this nursery wall i saw now they weren't sleeping babies don't have to sleep in heaven but they have these beautiful like a little niche these are little tiny babies most of them and the angels give them a nickname unless the parents have named them and they grow so slowly birds come in and the birds take them for rides around heaven all kinds of fun things for them to do they can sing laugh dance and god has this beautiful place for them and they will be there until either the grandparents come home or somebody close to that baby in relation they get to take them and keep them to the parents get there the parents take turns raising them and eventually they grow they step into the gift remember we talked about gifts they each have a gift whether it could be anything designing um it could be like music it could be art it could be dance it could be culinary arts it could be creating all kinds of gifts and things for people making things out of gems i know they have jewelers and things in heaven whatever their natural gift is they'll still use that in heaven they'll step into their gift and eventually they will have their own mansion when we come home to heaven we come home as god's son or daughter and all those babies will be growing in the most beautiful amazing place loved by jesus himself and fun places that he made for them so your babies know who you are they definitely can't wait for you to get to heaven so that was beautiful you brought that jen okay um this question is from jan vincent and he wants to know if you can practice christianity and witchcraft no and what if you you cannot claims that he pray for people and heal people with jesus name but yet also do witchcraft stuff i will tell you what the bible says there'll be some people who go there one day and jesus will say depart from me i never knew you you cannot practice evil and say you are a believer too you cannot do both when you become when you practice witchcraft you're partnering with satan even the bible talks about that it was called necromancing in the bible and it's all evil it belongs to satan witchcraft controls and i know that one day they'll actually be people that are called themselves good witches there is no good witch and i've heard from some of them myself and let me tell you when you partner with satan he will lie to you deceive you but you cannot you have to choose one or the other because christianity you believe in jesus christ as your savior he does not tolerate witchcraft he never practiced witchcraft he spoke against witchcraft even himself in the new testament so it's wrong it belongs to the enemy and this is a thing people will get healed in the name of jesus it's jesus's name healing them but that doesn't mean they get reward for that and the bible says will be people who come before god there's also people who say they're a christian but they sin in bad ways they sin but they go hold meetings people get saved they'll get healed they may get words from god because that doesn't stop operating you the way you choose your own life to live and what you personally choose yourself will be demonstrated by the way you live your life that means you can't be a witch and you can't belong to jesus you have to choose okay because when you die whoever owns you or you serve will come to get you and if you're practicing witchcraft that gives the enemy the right to come and get you when you die so i would not mess around with that get witchcraft out of your life i pray for people to be delivered from witchcraft spirits that doesn't come from god so don't play around don't read books on witchcraft don't go see movies about witchcraft you're opening a door in your soul for the enemy to begin to control you and these people who think they can be do both are under a great deception so i'm just saying there's evil people people who are doing wrong sinning but going and having meetings people come they get saved by the name of jesus they get healed by the name of jesus they get worse because the holy spirit is going to speak to those people it isn't that person okay don't follow people who you know are sinning don't do it because you follow jesus christ those who believe the word of god and live the word of god there's double accountability for leaders and so he will hold them doubly accountable but it says one day when they come before him and want the reward there will not only be no reward he will not allow them to remain okay so you can't you can't do evil and do god you have to choose god you cannot have evil in your life and witchcraft is one of those satanism is witchcraft any false religion don't try to practice two religions at the same time any witchcraft and you don't allow it in you make sure you're running your race to make a difference for jesus christ it says for us to be like him he didn't practice any of that he actually spoke against it so those people are deceived there you go okay um this one's really long but i'm not going to read the whole entire thing and uh again you have discussed this but um this is from charity um herself and she says she has such a struggle with being you know you can share on this experience i can share on this i absolutely can share on this and number one i want to let you know this god does not approve of any violence no abuse okay no kind of abuse whatsoever whether it's physical abuse verbal abuse god is against that and and let me tell you this that he would rather you be by yourself than be with someone who's abusing you i know that many spiritual leaders through the years have said uh and it can happen on both sides okay i'm not saying i know women that were violence and abuse their husbands and i know men that were violent and abused their wives it happened on both sides so you can't say one is worse than the other abuse is abuse okay uh but for instance let's just say for instance i had prayed for people before they were under severe abuse and this was a wife and she was abused physically all the time and when she went to her pastor they would say you cannot leave your husband the bible says you cannot do that no that was not the right thing to say to them okay god does not put up with abuse he doesn't approve of anybody abusing anybody you certainly have the right to not be abused and this is the thing if it is sin let's just say it's sin if we say it sin sins can be forgiven if you divorced and it wasn't out of abuse when you just divorced you didn't want that person you you divorced them you can go before god and say i repent of that that doesn't mean you have to go back to the person you're already divorced your pen is wiped away sin is wiped away people you can't hold those sins against people not even things they did 30 years ago if they repented of those things then god doesn't remember them anymore and i happen to know myself personally some people don't like me after i tell them this i went out and picked out somebody it wasn't god's choice this is what the bible says and god came to me himself one day and i was abused horribly uh when i was married to somebody else and god came to me and said how long are you going to put up with that and i said well what should i do about it he said you have a contract you don't have a covenant he said my word says what god has joined together let not man put asunder what that means is don't let man end it he said if if god put it together if it was god who brought you together and then again even if you did and you repented for doing that later it's still forgiven okay people don't like it when i say that sin is sin if you repent it's forgiven no matter what kind of sin that is it's it says that he remembers it no more he's not going to treat you like a lower human being okay god's not going to do that i'm still pursuing my destiny i repented of that and uh god said end the contract so we i got divorced because god told me to he said you'll never be who i need you to be if you remain married to that person i didn't bring you that person that is not my choice that's not a covenant a covenant is when i bring you together i didn't look for anyone god brought me the husband i have now we've been married 43 years and let me tell you a marriage is a trial it's a trial it's a challenge because you've got two individuals coming together as one maybe you like different things you do things different ways make sure that you're marrying the person god has for you and even then there could be conflict but make sure you're praying for each other i'm just going to include all this in this package that's not just a yes or no thing now yes or no abuse is as bad as running around on your spouse it's still abuse that is mental abuse if you're married and you go find someone else and sleep with them and you you choose them over your spouse and you're still married and all this is going on that is sin that is for sure sin but it's abuse god puts abuse in that same line that says that talks about adultery in that home meaning is severe abuse and that's what he recognizes even in the bible that you can be divorced if that happens this is a very touchy question but i don't mind answering it okay i suffered a lot of abuse but put up with it for six and a half years until i finally said to god what do i do and he said how long are you going to tolerate it i had to repent to the person i married i didn't even love them i had to repent to them i'd repent for them that that had to be ended because god had asked me to end it so there was repentance on my side and then god brought me the right person and i married them because he said you will marry this person so people can fight and argue and yell all you want to it's about what you repent from if it was wrong what you did it's been ended and it's over and maybe the other person is remarried he certainly doesn't expect you to go after them and make them remarry you you repent for the whole situation give yourself to god and he probably most more than likely will bring you somebody else to be with you god doesn't want us to be alone okay and the reason why he has marriage is so we don't have to go through this life alone it says the marriage bed that means you know what that means that means a living together having physical relations when you're married god approves of that when you're not married and you live together and do that he does not approve of that and there's many reasons why because when you come together you're actually sharing your soul with each other this is more than you ever thought you were going to get this is what happens when you ask the deep questions okay and the more of yourself you give when you're married you're empowering each other but when you're not married and you're sharing physical relations with each other you're giving parts of your soul away layers that you shouldn't be doing that to someone you're not married to so there's your whole story it's all about abiding in god married they're christians and they marry someone who's not it's a much harder lifestyle if they don't want to agree with what you're doing maybe make sure you find that up before you get married but i can tell you that if anyone repents they are forgiven and you can't drag that stuff up and throw it back in their face again because what you that is then wrong okay you have to forgive too even it was something that was done to you that that unforgiveness will hurt you worse than what you experienced before in your life get rid of all unforgiveness and all offense no matter what it was and you run your race and let god bless you and so there's that very long answer about that question but god doesn't tolerate abuse in any marriage no physical abuse no mental or emotional abuse that beats you up until you feel like you're nothing at all he doesn't want you to stay in a situation like that okay he doesn't and so uh pray let god open doors of safety for you and you seek him to see what you're supposed to do next but he does love you there you go so um somebody actually asked me a question oh wow jen what did they ask you they wanted to know if i've ever been to heaven okay so come over here and say thank me if they ask you then you give them their answer hey i'm kind of in my gym clothes still it's okay everybody looks like that right now anyway so i've never been to heaven but i have had um three open visions uh during the time that i was writing the the first children's book and well two times were with the first children's book and then the third time was during the well well i've been writing the second but he did something special for you didn't he yes um when i was writing the first book i wrote one sentence down and i was in my office and my whole office went black and then my wall kind of opened up like a movie screen and i it was like i was seeing the book come alive so it was all in cartoon form every time i've ever had an open vision about heaven it's been in cartoon form that's cool and so i was seeing the characters in the book and walking down the streets of gold and um one of the times that that happened they were going into the amusement park which kat talks about in her first book and i was seeing all kinds of things um and things that i had never heard her talk about and so it was like i was walking with them i didn't see myself on the path but i knew i was walking with them seeing my characters walking down the streets of gold and going into the amusement park and one of the things that really fascinated me which is going to be in the first kids book is i saw a merry-go-round and instead of uh the horses that you sit on there are actual live animals and they were whole the the people children adults and there were even some animals writing on there so it looks like animals it was quite funny um but they were riding on the backs and they had rains and then instead of their little platform yeah instead of a pole being down the middle um they were on a platform that would go up and down and i had never heard her talk about i didn't know that and so i was so excited it went in when the vision was over i come running out of my office to tell her what i saw and and she's like yeah that's up there so um and there were other things that i saw too and what what were some of the well or some of the animals you could write on jen not what you would think yes it is was um dinosaurs there was even a whale so apparently somebody had always wanted to ride a whale i mean i guess it it wasn't huge so it shrunk down to fit on the merry-go-round but there was a seahorse that didn't need water to breathe no it didn't it didn't and there was uh jungle animals uh you know like elephants and lions and real ones yeah real ones breathing ones and it was really cool and uh there was like a little raccoon that was on the back of i think it was like a hippo or something it was so funny but um yeah and they like lollipops don't they yes the raccoons like yeah yeah because they even saw a raccoon riding on the rush yeah so that that was my experience and it was it's happened three times now yeah and uh so yeah that'd be awesome yeah yeah that was a great answer i'm back over here now okay maybe a couple more questions so that we can we do have a couple more things i have to do today but how much fun is this to just have a just a spontaneous q a session and now you find out some people can see heaven and cartoon form that would be really cool so oh let's see and so when you see like you know teal squirrels or or purple elephants yes that exists in heaven everything is different colors in heaven i love when you talk about the messenger squirrels yes that we're talking the greeters the breeders i've always called a messenger squirrels they're greeters they sing and dance with top hats the squirrels when you have a party somewhere in your home yes people have parties and they come to entertain and they have top hats and canes and some of the best dancers i've ever seen and you you you just you know get home and say hey we're having a party we'd like for you to come do some some of your performance you never know what's going to happen up there it's just great so what would you say to someone who's been praying and asking to see jesus and angels and it hasn't happened yet i would say um stop praying and asking and start thanking him i'm real serious about that because it happens at the most unexpected times and it's usually not when you're asking i'm just gonna give you a free little tip and many times it's not when you're praying either most of my encounters i have in heaven is not when i'm praying somewhere i'm not even reading my bible i'm doing everyday stuff and he catches me up and sometimes i'm doing everyday stuff and then an angel walk up walk up and say something or i'll see them doing things or um so you have to just understand you think if you don't get in some spiritual position of what you think would be proper then it's not going to happen jesus also visits me when i least expect it and so i would just say expect have an expectancy that is going to happen you know and i you know maybe share to people i'm expecting this to happen and you'd be surprised how soon or quickly it happens then well i know the first time i saw an angel which was um um the one that was watching uh ben do the shipping and receiving yeah we've seen i was working at my desk typing right here in this room and at the core of my eye i just see this most radical looking angel leaning he's just like like this watching him pack up the products to ship out and i was like okay and i just kept on typing you know what even the angels love it that we're sharing heaven and all of our products represent something about heaven or living righteously or being dangerous against hell all of the products we put up for that reason and we we do have mp3s now we have dvds cds mp3s we have photographs we have artwork now we have calendars we have cups we have all kinds of stuff we're creating um to to demonstrate and manifest heaven like here's one of the cups right here i have one it says i don't do demons and there's a little lightning bolt representing when they were all kicked out of heaven you know then once you follow loose for that's what that lightning bolt represents some hell doesn't like it that we market stuff like this because it points fingers at them anyway so we do all kinds of things so angels are going to be present even if you don't see them they're present if you're speaking on behalf of god when you're praying they're there your angels always there maybe turn around every now and then say thank you for watching over me that's perfectly okay you're not sitting down having tea with them however if god allows it enjoy it we're living in a different life and time now and i know that before the end does come which is generations away it will be normal for you to see angels in your home and angels in your car outside your car because they're there all the time i see them and i know more and more the spiritual realm and these are spiritual beings in the spirit realm the spirit realm will be more and more visible in our lives so you live in a great time okay you live in a great time and great things are about to happen in this earth even in the midst of everything else god has his plans and so i would just encourage you we'll probably take one more question and that will be it for today and you never know when we're going to show back up again yes i i hope that you're enjoying this time with us and uh even though it was unplanned i love spontaneous spontaneous still happens in heaven okay okay and so uh well we'll let jen um okay share one more question um okay this might take a while but i know we've discussed this before that's okay someone wants to know i don't i don't didn't see who asked the question but someone wants to know is the virus the mark of the beast or the the vaccine the vaccine it's the mark of the beast uh we we've had this long conversation about this everything is many years something comes up that is the mark of the beast yes and i have lived along with you and let me tell you they were doing it back in the 50s oh i was alive oh even mom it my our mom who was born in the 30s she was born in the 30s they said even back then they were saying that the rapture was coming the rapture was coming you know you know what he says about all that just so you know revelation 21 the very end of the bible okay the very end of the bible there's so much still that has to happen the best of things other than christ being born him dying on the cross tearing up hell wasting hell okay those were amazing powerful things the holy spirit coming those were great times but we're entering into some of the most powerful exciting times as a believer that's your life that's the what you what's coming for your life okay but i can tell you the mark of the beast is nowhere right now there's nothing that's been created on the earth that is the mark of the beast at all in any way whatsoever it isn't the michael chip oh no they used to say the bar code okay when i was going to the barcode you're going to walk around with a bar called this big on your head right that was going to be the mark of the beast this is the crazy thing i will say this the mark a mark is a visible mark you will see it a visible permanent mark you will see it with your eyes it's not something hidden in your skin it's not something that will happen or a frequency that will be around no it's not the 5g it's not 5g people this is what god said about 5g that just means the gospel will go further and stronger than ever before around the world around the world which is his purpose so don't look for the 5g to be the mark of the beast that can't even happen okay the antichrist is not on the earth the spirit or the attitude or the nature antichrist means anything that's against christ himself anything that speaks truth and hope is and then that is the that is the truth but anything that speaks against it is an antichrist spirit jesus said even now the antichrist spirit is in the earth he didn't mean the person he met the way it will operate he will speak against god the antichrist will be against jesus christ his holiness his sovereignty it will speak totally against all of that that that stuff is going on but the antichrist himself has not been born how about that one people he's not on the earth because he couldn't operate in his fullness with the body of christ taking authority over the earth ruling and reigning on christ uh changing things speaking to things it wouldn't be able to be here he couldn't be here in the time when the antichrist comes the whole world will be falling apart millions of people will be missing off of the earth it will be a horrible experience for people and he will be their their protector he will be their savior the antichrist will have answers for all that stuff he's not here that stuff is not happening so no the mark of the beast is not out here somewhere but it will be a permanent visible mark and satan will make sure people want to take it back in the days of that happening and you will see it walking down the street he can't force you to take it people because it would defeat his purpose his purpose he wants to flaunt that people want him and they they want him to be there so this is not the time for any of that it's not the time of the four horses of the apocalypse it's not the time for the wormwood whatever to hit the earth it isn't time for death and destruction it isn't it is the time for the the knowledge and understanding and the operation of the glory the power of god seen going around the earth in these days there's baptism in fire that will burn all the fear out of you all the world out of you okay that has not happened yet okay the manifested sons and daughters speaking to earthquakes to make them stop and put it back the way it was before it happened or anybody died that's a manifested son or daughter raising the dead that were cremated that's a manifested son or daughter are you seeing that it's not even happening but we have to have this in the earth because she said it would be here and the wealth of the will the wealth of the wicked has to be transferred to the just and the righteous those things haven't even started stop asking if the mark of the beast is out there stop asking if this is the end and everything's going to crash and just be blown away it isn't and i have news for you the earth won't even stop being here until after the tribulation is over and it's done and gone they'll still be natural people on the earth jesus christ will sit on the throne in jerusalem for one thousand years when all of that is done and gone many of us will be in heaven okay and then the earth then jesus will be king of the world for one thousand years will be no wars no weapons will even be used saint will be in the bottomless pit just falling he will not even be on the earth there'll be no evil on the earth at the time there'll be people who don't want christ on the earth so you can see that even at the end of this age we're in which is still got quite a few generations to it the next age after this age will be the millennial age so the earth will still be here it'll still be operating it says people will still be getting married and being given a marriage so don't try to make god's will be pushed into a little box of what people have told you it will be this is not the last day this is not the perilous times where you can't build you can't eat there won't be anything to do you'll barely be able to breathe you won't see blue sky you won't even be here during that time you are here during some of the greatest days on the earth and i'm just going to end with this because it is so powerful to understand god's timing he has things in his own word he wrote if they're still in some of the newer bibles i hope they leave them in there the perilous times have not happened the tribulation has not happened it will not happen for quite a long time your focus is to know christ to have an intimate relationship to speak hope life create things invent things give people hope for a future not demon gloom okay god himself the father is the only one who decides when jesus comes back and he is too busy ruling and reigning with us okay so look for greatness look for god's plan for your life run after it don't sit him on the curb somewhere make sure he stays with you no holy spirit and know that you are chosen to be here now you are not chosen for wrath we as the body of christ have not been appointed unto wrath so we won't be here there will be people saved during the times of the tribulation those are other people who were not christians before that happened okay you focus on what he wants right now which is he wants you to be great for him in the earth bring hope and life watch your words watch your choices but live happy make sure you have fun because heaven is half fun and half powerful it's so filled with splendor glory and awe of god fun as a weapon against fun is a weapon when you're having fun the enemy doesn't like it so make sure you're using confusion too yes it confuses his head because he can't understand why he's not keeping you crushed down all right run after god himself and let god take care of all the rest of that stuff don't look for the mark of the beast it's not going to come in the letter it's not going to come in an email nobody can send it to you nobody can put it on you they can't force you to take it so you're not even in the generation that will be a part of that that means you are here to do powerful amazing things with him let your faith build trust god regardless of what's going on yes i've been through hard things before my life but i trusted him even when i had nothing i trusted him and believed his word and i told him i did bless his heart bless your angels heart by declaring the things of god it'll change the atmosphere where you live choose god choose life be powerful in the earth for him and we will see you later right jen [Music] yep [Music] you

major very soon so i'm so glad you're here on the show and and miss catker no introductions needed a one and only how are you doing ma'am welcome welcome i'm in a constant state of excitement right now that's what i'm doing i'm i'm feeling exactly what they're feeling in heaven they're excited about right now and what god's doing right now uh will touch and change this world for the next 100 years you know i'm just going to throw it out there because that's what the father does with me i can just tell you this is very key very important a lot of people maybe get trapped on the side about you know maybe violence or this going on but i can tell you god's got his plan and he's going to work it and it's going to be amazing and i just want to add this about the northwest did you not know the places that are the most significant to god are the ones that are attacked the most by the enemy and that's why satan wants to keep that area dry because it is like a wellspring i'm not just a well but a wellspring and i'm telling you god is going to explode from that area and come from that very corner of uh this country and flood all over the place so just stay excited everybody and don't miss it don't miss this event that's gonna happen wow that's powerful because uh you know you're talking about wellsprings and really i want to talk right now about the wellsprings of revival i believe we are in a season where god is re-digging or digging up the old wells like in the days of isaac yeah and he's also digging up new wells the old wells and the new wells and of course right now we're in the month of february it's it's my favorite uh month of the year why because it's my birthday month so welcome to february everybody but of course in this month uh catherine coleman passed uh billy graham pass john paul jackson bob jones and paul kane so i really feel like kat and sherelle did this season god wants us to dig up the old wells and the new whales of revival in america because we're in a new season now i want to ask you miss cat what do you think about that word and what god's doing and digging up the old wells and the new wells right now well i do know this that he's definitely in a generational thing right now which means the generations of the past and everything that they did and made as a foundation is going to explode in this in the generations of this uh time on the earth and those who are alive on the earth it's going to really it's going to accelerate everybody forward and upward and so yes i definitely agree with that the things that the people lay down their lives for i love it that in the month of love you know god took all those mighty men and women home and i actually knew bob jones would go home the father told me the birth of february and taking bob home on the 14th and he said it's going to open up whole new portals whole new gates all over this nation and he said so everybody needs to be excited and you know but that was several years ago but that doesn't matter god builds on things he knew everything that would happen and yet he's still gonna do everything he wants but this is what we'll have at the end we will have great victory and great celebration come on absolutely and i'm just being reminded miss cats of again bob jones prophetic word when the kansas city chiefs win the super bowl it will be a sign of world revival of the end times billions of harvests and of course last year the kansas city chiefs won after a long hiatus and it was a sign of course column drum you know uh you know with the dates and the coach and all of that but right now the kansas city chiefs are in the super bowl another time for the second consecutive year in a row awesome and i feel like again this is a double double sign double for your trouble sign that god is raising up the apostolic chiefs in america right now yeah you know and again i just love what you said miss cat that that mantle of the prophetic and of love of bob jones and of the kansas city prophets it's really coming down right now so strong yeah um wow my gosh and i i just want you miss cat if you could just pray into that right now in this moment because february is a month of love like you said but it's a month of mantles and a prophetic glory invasion can you just pray one thing one more second um the double thing totally goes into all of this because god started talking to me about the double uh divine decade divine decade uh and there's a double there's the 20 20 to 30 and the 30 to 40. this is going to stretch that long in this in this on this earth a lot here in america but god i thank you father for having your will your way this day that we're going to just skyrocket in this month of february god that people will see your love in our lives but also the true prophetic follow those with the true prophetic word god will step forward they may some be unknown some known but i know this is your time in the earth for for people to know you and to hear your word your true word which will excite people it will not be human gloom at all it's going to be your power your love your way in this earth and so by the way thank you for that and we come against anything of the enemy that would interfere or stop or halt or delay any of that in jesus name we say no more we command the host of heaven to go ahead and pull down every stronghold of satan trying to stop anything in this event keeping anyone from being a part of it we declare your power be seen and heard in this earth through the mouth of your prophets god we thank you for the mantles to be awakened god and those even carrying them to be brought alive in this time i thank you this is your time on the earth and we agree with your plan wow amen and amen absolutely i i feel like right now because of where our conversation's going i feel like we need to talk about what is god doing in this month of february what is god going to do in our country and in the nations of the earth that i just feel such an expectation and an anticipation because february is going to be a mega month of miracles so let's talk about that right now and i want to pass to mike in the florida prophetess sherelle what do you what do you sense what do you expect god to do in this month of february in this season right now well it's it just blew my mind that as soon as you guys got on here you started talking about the wells of revival i don't know if you guys know about a prophetess named fuchsia pickett but she was a prophetess back here in the 70s i believe and she i was reading some of her book last night and she was talking about how wellsprings of revival were going to burst up in certain areas of this uh of washington and this area over here and so i began to see a vision when i was reading that and i saw the lord show me that there's been like holes of revival in the grounds of the earth here and some people have sown seeds of faith and they've prayed and they've prepared the way and revival has come up to the surface a couple times but man put his foot on the coals man tried to stop the move of the holy spirit and what the lord is saying to me about these next few months is that we are going to be led by the spirit the spirit is going to lead us man is no longer going to lead the spirit and it's i'm i'm excited i just feel like the holy spirit what the lord showed me in 2017 he told me that the holy spirit will be given a platform and that's what we're seeing in this season a place that is cultivating revival by letting the holy spirit lead amen and you know just uh just to piggyback on that you know really the next three months i want you to hear these words because the next three months there's going to be monumental momentum that's going to take place from now passover i wish somebody heard me today from today february 1 to passover which is of course in the middle of april for the next three months there's going to be mega momentum monumental momentum that's going to shift you into harvest and into miracles so there's going to be a lot of setup for financial miracles miracles in your business and even salvation in your family but from now to passover begin to prepare because there's going to be mega setups for your divine breakthrough now before i pass the mic over uh to the woman of god cancur i just want to read the scripture because we're talking about whales because i believe god is springing up wells right now in the spirit genesis 26 18 isaac reopened someone said reopened which means it was closed but he opened up again isaac reopened the wells that had been dug up in the time of his father abraham which the philistines ding ding ding key were philistines which are enemy opposing giants the giants of the land the giants of welfare of poverty of socialism the giants of human trafficking of the elitist the philistines had stopped the whales after abraham died and so right now these giants of the land of 201 are trying to stop the wells or stop the flow of your finances stop the flow of the holy spirit stop the flow of revival but god wants to anoint you to dig up and open up again what has been closed by these philistines these opposing giants and god's going to be doing it from today february 1st all the way to passover so you watch god's about to open up miss cat what are your thoughts here what do you want to say to the people right now i i have to say exactly what the father is continually saying to me don't we don't lose that um that spirit of celebration and maybe you don't know this people but celebrating in heaven is mainly what they do it's one of the ways they worship god it's one of the ways they are are thankful and grateful to him for all the things that they that he did for us while we were on earth and also once they get to heaven and so they are celebrating in heaven already and i do know another prophet uh hank kuhneman who always talks about january february and march that leads into april and he is almost in line with what you're saying he says that january will begin to bring justice february will be all the fireworks of the beginning of everything happening and then marching into the end of the march will be great celebration and miraculous so uh that's what he has heard from god i can tell you that i continually hear that justice is already beginning to be served and all the stuff that's going on and just let me add what the father just shared with me yesterday about all the stuff going on we know that those who are now sitting in seats of authority are illegitimate that's what the father says is illegitimate power in other words not power given in the natural not power given in the spirit you know the whoever is the head of a government it says that when the righteous are in power the people rejoice but when it's the wicked and the evil are that great the sadness comes upon them well i need to remind everybody that right now those who are in authority don't have power not real power which will be shown and proven when that great victory comes and god will shift back what his intentions always were and the truth is this the one who is in true authority even right now yeah which is trump he is actually a president he did win the election and he is the one in authority still welcoming god still having plans by the way he's still getting ready to work plans i just have to let you all know that and it's beginning to be no secret that that's happening so there's a lot of people right now in dc very afraid demons are leaving dc like crazy i mean they're just leaving racing out of there and this is what god said that is because it's illegitimate power so those who are righteous right now they are still in power they're the ones in power and what he says what our president says the true president says is what will affect this cup this country not just in the natural but in the spirit realm this is what the father says the wicked and evil trying to rule they have no power no true power so they have no right no portals open to them to allow evil to flood this country like people think is happening i'm sorry but the devil isn't going to be taking over because there's no true portal or opening you have for that to happen that is shut you should be rejoicing everybody because this is going to be an accelerated thing that begins to happen with the revival going into the habitation of god in this in this country and all over the world actually so these are celebrator times these are victorious times these are not times to be crushed and to be sad and to have fear in you about the only thing the devil's getting away with is bringing fear all those regulations and all those laws being made illegal illegitimately will not stand yes well this is why you should be celebrating because we will have the ability to move unhindered all open country as god moves and does the victory thing and you will see it with your eyes everybody will see it with your eyes this is why it's so important to come to these events right now to get filled up to get excited to begin to make plans with god himself about what your part will be in this so this is a strategic event you don't want to miss this this event because this is god's time to bring in that double decade the divine decades uh back to back in this in this country here and it's going to be so powerful your life won't be the same we don't want it to go back exactly the way it was we want it to be greater more powerful in god that we will be more accelerated forward and the law will flow in this country especially between the body of crisis was really needed first and i declared that that love will be released because the other can't be hell can't be released right now people if you get me in the spirit room if you were a or you would understand it's leaving hell is leaving and so that leaves those who want to be in power power less they won't have the effects they won't have the enticement they won't have that uh the captivation of hell and evil although it's already in them it will not be released or lose throughout this land because there's been no portals open because the one in true authority is not allowing it come on that's so good and of course the wells are actually portals because wells one more thing there are these massive angels some of the hosts have already been sent to some of these wells and they have these swords probably they're 15 feet high swords and they're like standing there like this over them about to hit them when we declare something at this event they will hit these wells these drywalls and they will literally be open and they'll shoot on springs so this is a specific event planned by god so this can happen so don't miss being a part of uh having those wells open can i share something with you really quick uh that's what i was seeing in the spirit when i was beginning to pray and see you coming over to this area i saw you just taking a stake and driving it into the ground and it just broke open this area and i saw the wells begin to bubble up and the the springs just begin to spring forth throughout the earth in this area and it just goes all the way from this side all the way down into the east coast and i just believe it's going to start something here in this area that has not been done before i'm so we are so excited well absolutely the convergence that happens when the right anointings and mantles come together and and times uh you do not receive a breakthrough because there's an element that's missing but i believe again us coming together especially with miss cat especially with the now anointing and the now word that she carries sun is gonna break open in the pacific northwest so listen people of god you need to be there at this event i mean we're pretty much sold out i don't know if we can do overflow open up the doors and have people just sitting outside we may have to do that honestly because we're already sold out uh but you know there's going to be something powerful that's going to be released that's going to affect all the regions of states nearby i guarantee it i believe witches are going to come to jesus yeah people who are in new age are going to be delivered okay to warlocks weekends people moving in the dark and black magic and dark spirits they're they're going to feel the tremors of the wealth opening up so it's going to be powerful um you know again as we're talking about all this again what god is doing in america right now on the earth what god is doing from now february all the way to april passover and now specifically for this conference this event the washington glory invasion you know i'm just reminded of again uh uh john g lake how he started up the healing whales and the healing rooms in spokane washington and you know there's something supernatural that happens in the pacific northwest and i believe something's going to break with that mantle now prophet shirelle is there something you want to share with us concerning john g lake the healing rooms and that well of revival that's about to burst open i just know that we are getting close we have been seeing more miracles than ever before in our second service we had a man come in and walk out of a wheelchair i mean when taylor ran up to me and she was like mom there's someone outside in a wheelchair and i was going oh my gosh not a wheelchair on my second service but it was incredible it's just awesome to be pioneering here what has been in god's heart for so long and i just what i'm seeing is that this explosion that's gonna happen no man can keep his foot on it then the holy spirit is getting ready to explode in this area i believe we're going to see miracles like never before i believe we're going to see limbs growing out more blind eyes and deaf ears being healed but not only that families being healed god is calling whole families in this season he's calling the prodigals home and i'm so excited to see and be a part of this movement and it's like god is strategically placing people the right people together people that probably really never wanted to do anything like this i don't know about you cat but i was just minding my own business when the fire of god fell on me in my living room and he told me to go live on facebook and i was like you want me to do what so i just believe that god is raising up a remnant in this season in this hour he's the people that he's bringing to the hub here are just so hungry and they're tired of church they're tired of religion they're tired of being put in a box i took the box slacks last week and i ripped it in half and i threw it and i stomped on it during the circuit because i just believe you know when we're led by the holy spirit it's powerful yes it is we give him the platform and he does it all it takes the pressure off of us and we just give him the reigns and we say have your way holy spirit and i believe that's people like john g lakes that's what he did he probably surrendered his life to the holy spirit and that's why god used him so mightily and that's what we're seeing right now and another thing is i feel like you know um god's using the most unlikely people yeah and people that are not really that well liked people don't like cats pink hair people don't like my pink lipstick but i'm just being obedient to god and just saying use me lord i surrender my life to you and he's gonna he's gonna do something in this area that we have not seen we are getting ready to see something that we have never seen i mean what are the odds of the kansas city chiefs going to the super bowl for a second time yeah that's incredible well well once again god god is the god of the miraculous and he's the god of the double and the triple so i believe in the season just like prophet shirelle said that the unlikely the no names the faceless those that objected looked down upon i mean president donald j trump took took it by storm and he came totally from left uh from the left side from you know left wing but again it's those types of people where there will be a supernatural grace to be an apostolic chief like the kansas city chiefs god's raising of apostolic chiefs prophetic warriors in the season who carry the now word of god and who walk in signs and wonders yeah uh of course we're talking about this event uh you know we're all going to be together literally in a few days i know my cities uh talk to us what are you expecting for this event it's really not even an event but it's it's a family celebration it is because it's actually an encounter um yes god doesn't always call things events anymore he calls them encounters and those who are there or who choose to encounter what he's got those are the ones who will go away with it to use it to release it for him but something else about john g lake um i remember one time when i was i was under attack that was probably maybe 12 14 years ago when all that happened and i was heading to memphis to um release elvis's mantle to be completed because it wasn't completed and then he bought me every way i could that's how important mantles are they're so important and i i told my husband knows throw me in the back of the truck there was a double cab and margaret drove all the way there and we were listening to um billy brims tapes about had all those who had passed on before she had recorded things and i think john g lake's son-in-law was speaking and he was talking about um speaking in tongues and i'm telling you it started to get really hot it was so hot and all of a sudden the holy spirit said i want you to claim it and so he was speaking under the anointing of the lightning power of god that was one of the things john d like operated in it just blasts the enemy out it's still a part of the fire of god and god said claim your healing and i yelled i couldn't speak up until that point it said i i claim it and all of a sudden a fire came through the speaker hit me at the end of my feet when i went my body and drove the sickness out and i was instantly and i was on fire it started getting so hot in the cab and i know the holy spirit was just laughing he was so celebrating see because i out of an act of obedience i was just dared to do it and when we got to the event when we got to the this place in memphis where i was speaking about albus and why god called him and anointed him and was talking about that mantle then people ran forward to get prayer the holy spirit said impart the fire of the lightning power of god into them i'm like when did i get that and he said you said you received it and i said i thought i received him and he said oh you have the mantle of the lightning power of god that john g lake operated in and since that day i have used that lightning power god it destroys the works of darkness no matter what is about and i did it so much so many times john g lake actually showed up at my event there you could see by several people who were present and he was just watching me release the lightening power of god i can tell you what's going to be the lighting power of god is going to be at that event people and it destroys the warts of darkness in your life in cities and regions and i mean no guess what it's probably going to show up there probably john g lake that's where he's from and so expect the lightning power of god expect the miraculous to happen and i do expect things to happen that never happened before so it's going to be a power a power encounter of god of holy spirit of jesus of this whole area being least at least released into its destiny to bring the life and the power of god into this country and then throughout the world so this is a major encounter time on god's timeline so please don't miss being there because we are all a part of this when we come into agreement great power is released wow that is so powerful that's why uh you know as myself and prophet shiro we prayed about a title for this encounter you know uh the washington glory invasion because the lightning angels of course the thunders and lightnings from his throne are actually angelic hosts that are being released from his throne okay those angels are going to be invading and they're they're already invading right now those angels are going to be invading this time and i believe right now even from that event conference region to wherever you're going to be connected or watching from to be a new measure of power a new measure of these mantles a new measure of healing don't be afraid of kobe don't be afraid of vaccinations don't be afraid of what the world says there's a new wave of miracle working power and healing as being so we're going to tap into something it's going to be incredible i can't wait to just celebrate the lord and and just to party with heaven all together it's going to be incredible um now uh of course right now uh as we're about to bring this broadcast to a close but uh we want to pray for you people of god we're

heaven that has surrounded us and are in and out of this building continually this night god we thank you for our guardian angels god and all that they have done for us father we thank you for watching over us for guarding and protecting what you have placed inside of us god thank you for helping us father to walk holy in the earth god holy unto you surrendered father laying down our life and living it in your son we thank you for your son and all that he has done all he's made available for us father it is precious and is holy i thank you for this holy time on earth god that we are all chosen to be a part i say yes father [Music] i say yes to whatever you want whatever you need me to do whatever you need me to say wherever you need me to go god that i will represent you that i will represent heaven god that we are all forerunners in this time we're forerunners for the body of christ father that you're changing our lives and changing our words because you have shifted us onto your timeline we cannot remain the same when we hear about the wonder and the glory and the splendor of your home and then we carry that god they will take the knowledge of the glory around this earth many times over demonstrating and manifesting for you and the way he's never seen before experienced before we thank you god that we're about to stun this earth and shock hell [Music] [Applause] as we walk in the shoes of your son and we run our race father the way you designed us to run it i thank you god for stirring up every gift and every person here tonight god i thank you for giving them witty ideas and inventions father this is your plan for now in the earth this is a new time and we're going to be that new creation that you designed us to be we'll have new words to hear and share about you about heaven i thank you father for this holy time we are grateful [Music] that you have revealed that we lived in you and you have sent us to this earth to love and live for you and to share truth and then take us back to you we thank you god that we will be in all of eternity with you it'll go from glory to glory splendor to splendor the wonder of you inside of us i thank you for the father and everyone said amen amen wow this is an awesome atmosphere thank you for coming everyone the only thing i like more about going to heaven is sharing it i can't teach you how to do that i have a commission to do that i can tell you that he is catching people up all over this world and showing them his home for christ said in my father's house are many mansions and i can assure you that his house is not a building it's not a platform somewhere in the sky it is a world bigger than our galaxy even bigger than that there's no way you can measure it or even understand how he designed it it's always been his home until the day he makes the new earth and then we all have a home together i don't know if you realize this is actually willing to leave his own home to live with us christ had to leave it when he became down to earth and he became flesh had flesh put him he died on the cross the holy spirit moved his base of operations here because christ sent him here and then one day the father himself will leave heaven and forever live on the new earth with all of us in that amazing that they had to be willing to do all of that for us that's because he loves you that's because you actually came from him everyone who ever existed came from him you didn't live somewhere in heaven you lived in him he was your very world the enemy is always trying to copycat what god has he wants to be god that's never going to happen it didn't happen back in the ancient times when he was thrown out of heaven when he was so convinced he convinced himself he had won he got a third of the angels on his side which still is almost it makes you undone to think about that doesn't it they lived with the god who made them and yet they chose a creation over the creator and let me tell you just because god didn't say anything to him didn't mean that he didn't know about it but the more he deceived and the more god remained silent he thought that he had won he thought he was smarter than god and then he found out in a second he wasn't anything he wasn't anything he was kicked out of heaven all the angels were kicked out with him they can never be restored and i know you may hear people preach that one day god will forgive everybody that everyone will go to heaven he'll forgive lucifer he'll forgive the fallen angels that will not ever happen their future is already sealed in the lake of fire they will not be anywhere near us on the new earth it says the former things will be remembered no more in heaven right now though you give testimony of your life and the victory that god gave you on this earth when you get to heaven but one day none of the things that that were a part of your life are without him well you will not even be able to remember them but i will tell you right now even on this earth we will become so supernatural like him let's say this together god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the earth that's his plan for you so people say that we can't be like him they're wrong he would have never said that and in case you didn't know after the likeness is the way they operate so he didn't just make you in his image he gave you things inside of you so that you could operate like him so who is he he's a creator right jesus christ is a commander is that right holy spirit goes every knows everything all at the same time holy spirit is an unlimited layered being don't you like revelation he has unlimited layers of himself and every layer of him is a whole of him so wherever he sends a layer of himself he knows everything everywhere all at the same time so for your information when you invite holy spirit to indwell you you don't get a little piece of him he sends a layer of himself which is a whole of him who indwells you and that is what makes you the temple of the holy spirit that is one of the most important things you can do after you get born again it's not even preached in some places right now you know because the enemy is terrified of that happening to you because then instead of walking beside you it says the word when you get born again he comes alongside you is that right and he'll be there all the time until you're caught up to heaven one day unless you do something about it unless you choose to ask him to indwell you you have to invite him say we must invite say we had to invite christ to indwell us we have to invite holy spirit to indwell us it's heaven protocol and the reason for that is you had to make a choice you chose with your will to receive christ and let me tell you we actually have a new cd card born again that the father had me just make it tells you what happened in the spirit realm what happened in eternity in the scrolls of time and the lamb's book of life in hell and inside your very being that made you the new creation what happened at that time at that moment in time and it's on this cd called born again it's one of the best witnessing tools i've ever had or ever made it explains why christ why do you have to receive him what happens when you receive him what levels you can go after after that happens what happens when holy spirit indwells you what happens all around you what happens with the host of heaven what happens with your guardian angel this if you're not aware of the spirit realm the unseen realm i'm talking about the unseen realm it says everything that was made that you see was made by that which was unseen that means the unseen realm is the original realm not this physical realm this physical realm is temporal it's temporary that's what that means but eternity is in this in the spirit realm there's more activity in the spirit realm than there is in the scene realm there's it never stops activity never stops in the unseen realm not around you not around where you live not in the atmosphere not into the third heavens there's continual activity both from heaven and from hell and what you do in your life will draw one or the other to you that's why you need discernment that's why you need holy spirit that's why you need to pursue an intimate relationship with jesus christ there's a lot of stuff going on in this world today even in the body of christ that shouldn't be happening there's a lot of good and there's a lot of god i'm not going to discount that because god is pouring himself more and more into this world christ is making himself known to us every day of our life you can increase in that relationship with him because he wants that kind of relationship with you he's not sitting on the sideline watching your life go by no he armed us when you were born again you got weapons you got the anointing you got authority given to you because you you are now a son of the living god your son or daughter of the living god and what you do with your life after you receive him is totally up to you but right now living on this earth are many that he called to demonstrate for him in the greater works that christ talked about they're beyond your imagination to even consider or think you might actually get to do some of that like going to a funeral and raising someone the dead that was cremated [Music] i hope i got someone's attention everybody say that's a greater work people think well you know lazarus was dead for four days correct that's in the scriptures he was dead he was stinking his body was stinking mary and martha we're trying to show christ it is too late let me tell you christ did not cry because lazarus died he said it was going to be okay didn't he yeah because he knew who he was you know he cried because they didn't believe it they were doubting him he had said yeah he'll be resurrected yes we know on the day that the dead in christ is raised he'll be raising who's trying to say no right now you know he was there right he knew what was going to happen let me tell you people in abraham's bosom were shocked do we ever think of that how many people don't know what abraham's bosom was let me see your hand it's okay if you don't know a lot of places don't teach that anymore before christ died on the cross and descended into hell and wiped up hell went up to heaven and poured out his blood on the mercy seat when people when righteous people died that god called righteous they descended into abraham's bosom which was a spiritual abode god made for his friends they didn't sit on rocks it was a spirit round place it had golden buildings it had a sky it had a magnificent river it had king's tables filled with feasts for them to partake of and below that was hell and there was a great gulf between them this is what the word says and those in hell right inside the gates of hell you come up to the courtyard of hell you could see up into abraham's bosom but you couldn't go there they could see them if they came close to there was like um i'm trying to think of the word my mind's not in the natural realm at all right now i like a balcony reigning thank you holy spirit in this beautiful place he'd made for abraham isaac jacob joseph who raised jesus right john the baptist was there is that true yes because they were righteous they were kind of righteous either because they believed in god himself and they extended their faith for that when they died they went there they didn't they didn't descend into hell that was for the wicked dad but they could see each other at one point and so people in abraham's bosom already knew the messiah was on the earth as soon as joseph went there they knew because he wouldn't stop talking about it if you knew that and you went there would you talk about it yeah he nonstop talked about it and then when john the baptist went who was his cousin he confirmed everything joseph said but he even knew more because he was there after joseph he was still there living on the earth after joseph went and descended abraham's wisdom so then john the baptist was talking about him he actually saw him right he baptized him he wouldn't stop talking i have baptized the messiah he is here on the earth he's here so they already knew in abraham's wisdom the messiah was on the earth so let me tell you when he showed up there they knew who he was and he proved who he was because he himself left for the first time left abraham's bosom and crossed over into hell on his own because he had an assignment it was to take back our authority and our dominion that god had given you know had given adam and eve and then they they sold out but you know what they were redeemed yes they're in heaven say yay adam and eve are in heaven how about that they made it so sometimes you don't really think about the whole scope of this picture and so as someone else came to abraham's bosom they would tell them what was going on on the earth because they were new the new arrivals and it's just like in heaven when somebody newly arrives they'll chase you down they'll start getting you the minute you come in the gate and you're standing trying to jump in the river they're like okay what about this whatever this is i heard this was going on what about this is this true now i saw something from the portal but i didn't know all about so why don't you why don't we go share somewhere they want to haul you off somewhere and share with you they want to hear what i want to hear what you have to say and later you're going to have meetings every one of your family members had to stand on a platform and share to the body of christ living in heaven about their life how god redeemed them what was going on around them and then what was newly invented on the earth they won every time somebody new comes they want to know i promise you it was exact same in abraham's bosom okay you don't get a chance to do that when you go to hell okay you have no life in hell been there and seen it you don't want to go there there's people right now saying there is no help they may find out one day there are there definitely is it talks about it in the word it exists it's there but in abraham's bosom life was amazing it was beautiful they had feasts to eat you don't get anything in hell there will be no food in hell i love that one song that says they don't see they don't serve breakfast in hell if you haven't heard it i think isn't it uh it's called like my father's house isn't that the name of the song but yeah big big house is big big house and they are telling people you won't get breakfast in hell you don't but abraham's bosom had more than enough and plenty they needed to enjoy their life they were always excited when somebody knew came there and most of the time they didn't have to ask them they came there talking about it especially once the son of god and the messiah was on the earth that was the number one subject they wanted to know about i know i was taken there i saw abraham's bosom it wasn't some little tiny hovel on a rock people picture them sitting in the middle of the earth you know trying to escape the lava the spirit realm supersedes this physical realm that's why spiritual beings can pass through the walls they can walk through you your angel stands in you most of the time yeah they sit on you too sometimes especially if you ever get out on the floor if you're knocked out by the spirit of god or the glory whatever it is that gets you on that floor and you can't move your angel is sitting on you you can't even crawl i've been there i'd see them sit on me and they wouldn't get up and all i could do was laugh i mean i couldn't crawl like tell my family don't bother me until i can crawl up to the you know alter leave me there you'll find out one day everything they did okay for you and to you but there was big news in abraham's bosom about the messiah once lazarus came he was dead for four days where do you think he was he was the newest thing in abraham's bosom and that man who was one of christ's best friends knew beyonce who he was he would not stop talking about the messiah and here he is like into his starting his fourth day there just going full steam ahead wham [Applause] they lost their messenger they heard a voice [Music] lazarus heard him he heard him calling him from there did you think he was going to say no i'm busy later when i'm done oh he did not care okay he called him to come forth he came out of abraham his spiritual body came at abraham's bosom back into the tomb picked up his body and he came out of that tomb still in the wrappings and he wasn't stinking [Laughter] because he was fresh alive by the glory of god raised up from the dead to be a miraculous demonstration of the power of jesus christ which has been given to you and i you should see it that way we are joint heirs with him what he did on this earth we have the ability if we walk in and go after it to do that he said that we have the ability to raise the dead right heal the sick raise the dead cast out demons is that right trump is supposed to you're right you're supposed to follow us if you believe you got to remember that there are requirements to all those who believe right these shot these signs shall follow them and so here was christ demonstrating it doesn't matter how long it doesn't matter if your dad you don't have you know no matter if you died right then raise him up no he was dead for four days so if we're gonna do greater works that means it has to be something greater than being dead for four days but he didn't mean being dead for seven days he meant when you were ashes i i was taken forward in time and i literally was shown this is one of the greater works and christ took me there and i saw somebody raising someone from the dead at a funeral that had been cremated and everyone in the funeral home ran down front through their face on the floor and began to cry out to jesus christ [Music] and i i am absolutely what he shows me is literal he doesn't show me symbolic things ever he treats me like i may he says i'm going to show you so you know what i'm talking about that is something that will happen i'm sure it will go viral around the earth so the knowledge of the glory sometimes will go through the internet [Music] did you think about that that's something worth watching over a few times isn't it people watch laughing dogs 10 million times and i want to point out no matter what tragedies and stuff are going on out there the laughing dogs top all the doom and gloom and the wicked evil stop because people want something that they're going to enjoy so why don't you give them something to enjoy your testimony should be filled with glory power right victory that's the word of your testimony you overcome with that that's not the story of your doom and gloom and and 10 hours of your sufferings that's a story a testimony is how you were tested and you got victory and christ gets all the glory for it he actually told me to tell you if you're writing a book about your life make sure he gets more than 10 pages because it won't be worth reading if you make people suffer along with you through your entire life and at the end you give an ounce of victory that doesn't show them that they can overcome even during the in the midst of what they're going through you should have victory every day of your life because he delivers us out of it all right so start giving him the victory the minute you step into something start declaring you have victory you're giving him the glory it's because of him not you that you are an overcomer because your words have power if you don't remember anything else remember to watch your words what do you want in your life what do you want in your family's life what do you want right now in your life because what you say is what you're going to get the word says you'll eat the fruit of your lips is that right whatsoever you will have whatsoever you say it loud you should have whatsoever you i think that means your words are important he made me count my words one time every time i opened my mouth i had to think about what i was going to say he trained me to speak life and not negative not negative unless he shows me something that he has said i am to be aware of and to not be a part of i don't run around spending my life critiquing everybody else's life and pointing out all their weaknesses because you're not helping them when you do that you're not you need to talk about people's strengths their gifts right god's plans for them share the truth with them while you're doing it because they're going to open they're going to be open for you to speak to them if you're encouraging them not blasting them and i also know that you help the enemy when you blast them it's like you're part of the enemy's camp this is my assignment to tell them how wicked and evil they are how far they have fallen from god that they're walking in hopelessness they'll never have anything no that is the enemy's words that's how he talks if you hear that don't say it if you hear those words turn around go i know who you are and i'll have nothing to do with you you'll freak him out because most people just say what he says right so if we're going to be like christ in the earth we have to be careful what we say how we live the choices that we make in our life your soul is fed every minute of the day by what you say what people say to you what you watch what you hear and places you go your soul is going to be whatever this is the way god said whatever you enter into is going to enter into you that's a quote a quote from heaven what you enter into will enter into you that means in your soul and that's important because you are a living soul we've all said you know we have we you know we we we we're a body we are a spirit we have a soul no you are a soul you are a soul wrapped in your spirit man and you have flesh on your body so you can have dominion in the earth but you are a soul and you choose whether it prospers or not if you want to prosper and be in health then you guard what goes in your soul you can change the way you think the way you respond even what happens to you tomorrow by what you decide tonight to do with your soul you can't take your soul and set it on a shelf and pretend like it's something bad because when i grew up in in denominational churches they always said the soulless realm is bad your soul is bad well then how come it got saved [Laughter] i was eight and i would have all these big questions for people that they didn't want to answer if my soul just got saved right he came to save souls right if i gave it to jesus and he moved in then why is my soul bad i don't think anything bad i'm not looking at bad stuff i mean just only eight years old but they made decisions when i was young i was going to be in the side of my parents i was going to be on god's side you know i was going to help him he needed help so i really consider what i do with my life even when i was young i did so i escaped even though i was raised as a teenager and the whole drug thing when it first came out by by the way marijuana is bad no matter what they tell you that's from heaven he did not make it so you could smoke it i don't care if it is a natural plant i will preach it i grew up in that time when it first came well in my era when it first came people lost jobs they lost friendships they got sucked into lsd and all the other drugs i didn't do any of it i decided at 15 i was having nothing to do with it and i wasn't participating so i still have all my brain i'm in great help because i never participated in the drug thing i didn't need anybody else's approval i wasn't part of a clique i didn't know that peer pressure bothered me actually i tried to talk all my friends in high school well my acquaintances i didn't have a lot of friends i had i had a tribe at home i would tell them i'll look right um i said you're nuts for taking this stuff you're gonna burn your brain cells up you know what are you gonna become you can't even think right and people got i think i think 60 out of 600 seniors uh od'd in my senior class off from drugs and all of them started on marijuana every single one of them they actually give it to you free they give it to you free get you hooked up then they bring something stronger to you that's how it works i was in the elevator in the hotel and i heard a young man he had come here on business to meet with some business people here and he was saying on the phone not knowing who i was we blasted him with the anointing the whole time was there when he left he said oh yeah i had a great time my business meeting were very productive and he said these people were they were real real with me we drank and we smoked some i knew what he meant okay he didn't need it for medicinal purposes but these were leaders in a business community that gave it to this young man that's not even ethical it's not right he hadn't even had it before but that's the enemy's plan and he was saying man this was an amazing experience in my mind i'm thinking devil you are not getting that person man i was standing right now releasing the anointing him he walked out the door we sent the host of heaven upon all the strongholds of the demonic the addictive demonic to pull that stronghold off of him and pull it off of him and we were sending on the glory after him the anointing after him to break the yoke of darkness off of him and went god i am not tolerating this i'm not tolerating it and people well jesus didn't he said he talked about any kind of pharmacia that was drugs even back in his day they had them he talked about necromancers have nothing to do with the necromancer that is witchcraft there's no good witches and there's people that really think there are there are no good witches warlocks wizards magicians there was not one magician in the bible that was good and we're sitting here we've been so consumed with society and the world itself that we've accepted a lot of stuff but let me tell you he never accepted it so we need to take a good long look at ourself and say where am i where am i and what god has called me to be what he what he showed me i am what christ gave me how did he walk what did he do we had braces forever what would jesus do not a lot of what goes on now because if we're witnesses our life's supposed to be a witness right you didn't know you were going to come to church tonight because i'm saving the good stuff for next all those in abraham's bosom they lived a righteous life according to receiving god okay they believed who he was they believed when he spoke they believed they followed him and what he said and so they were kind of righteous so they were they descended in abraham's bosom but the minute lazarus showed up they knew something was going to happen on the earth not just to them they knew somebody changed for them because their messiah had come they knew it they knew something would be manifested in the earth and it certainly was maybe not what they expected but let me tell you when christ himself showed up a little while later with the thief from the cross because when christ gave up his spirit he'd still be hanging there by the way he didn't no one killed him he laid down his life he actually had to make his spirit man leave his body he himself loosed it from his body yeah that's going to be in a movie one day and then you will see in the movie christ descending into abraham's bosom him sharing the good news with them all receiving him as christ as their savior and let me tell you when the spear men entered into that ground there was such an upheaval that they themselves walked on the earth that were in abraham's bosom go read the scripture they were seen walking on the earth is that crazy you'd think they'd get a hint right okay uh that one's from a hundred years ago 300 years ago he's walking on here something's going on down there [Music] and christ wasn't numb because then he was going to go wreck hal my favorite one of my favorite times was when they took me when they took me down into hell and i was there on the third day when christ wasted them [Music] it will be in a movie [Laughter] [Applause] not even a world-class movie a heaven-class movie that will be produced on this earth by the best of the best with the best special effects that will get people undone everywhere and they'll know what happened there's actually a demand in hollywood they want to know what happened between the cross and when he when he went back to heaven they want to know they want to know what happened [Music] now when he went back when when his disciples saw him ascending into heaven he'd already been there did you know that because when he came out of the grave what did he tell mary i must go to my [Music] my father and your father right yeah because he had to pour out his blood on the mercy seat in heaven so when he said it was finished on the cross that meant that every a sacrifice for all sin for all time was once and for all never again would something have to be sacrificed for sin you would never again go to the temple once a year to get forgiven did you know that they went once a year to get forgiven okay then they tried to do their best all year they go back again and then heavenly sacrifices they had this whole thing that god had shown them to do and then uh there's all kinds of things you need to go back and read it anyway that's the way you got forgiven that's what that's what freaked out all the high priest when john the baptist started saying you know repent of your sins the kingdom of heaven is at hand well they never heard that before that's why they didn't like him so when new revelation comes to the earth there's always upheaval and you're hearing the new what is the new that means new things will happen new ways will happen new words will happen you're living in a time like that right now yeah because we'll be ruling and reigning with christ this is a whole new time that was a new time a fullness of time has come that was the fullness of time so christ was wreaking heaven on the earth before he ever went into hell then he really wiped up because hell thought they thought they had won the second time satan had a brain freeze honestly he did the father said he lost something in his mind when he fell yeah part of his memory banks because he still thinks even now he's going to win he's already been defeated well he was he's totally defeated but i mean god kicked him out of heaven he didn't win them when he was going to take over and go inside the father and rule from inside the father and be over all the people the people weren't on the earth yet that was us inside god he knew we were in there isn't that interesting he knew about us for a very long time he didn't know who we were he knew we were important he knew we weren't angels because god didn't just speak and make us we lived in him forever until he made this earth time space plan to send us here and when he made adam's body when the word made adam's body and the father leaned over and breathed adam's spiritual being his spirit of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul uh the enemy was right there watching because he was thrown on the earth remember yeah he was watching he knew where that came from he knew that was somebody that came from inside god and then he was not well one way he wasn't happy because now god was sending them which would mean a lot of trouble for him if they ever found out who they were so god had a plan when he sent us people it was to be like him on the earth to take authority over all the power of the enemy crush him push him back take our rightful place that christ won for us he died for your sins but he went into hell to get back your authority that adam had given away because he was righteous and they had no right to hold him so abraham's bosom was ready to see a show and hell was ready to put on a show but there's only one person who put a show on and made a show of it openly and that was the son of the living god [Applause] if you if you don't think they like a show up there you don't know them because god put on a show wasn't that a show when he sent lightning bolts from himself and took satan out right and then one-third of the angels were all kicked out the same way they were celebrating in heaven because they had had it up to here with lucifer i don't know anyone in heaven that cried when he was kicked out the gabriel did not cry and michael certainly did not cry because from that moment on he knew who the enemy was because before that happened there was no enemy heaven was a delightful place it was a wonderful place it was perfect in every way even lucifer was perfect in all his ways until iniquity was found in him and that was that he was greater than god and he was going to take over that didn't happen either so he was kicked down to earth and decided well i'm just going to take over here on this nice place i'll just take over here let me tell you what happened when he first made those plans that didn't work either because then god brought the ice age and he was sitting on a block of ice you got to picture this this is reality movie from heaven when he was first cast out of heaven the dinosaurs were on the earth there was there was no sin on the earth there was no darkness on this there's no evil on the earth okay he brought that with him he began to make it a wilderness the dinosaurs began to kill each other because in the beginning they didn't i saw him i saw the earth when he made it the first time the dinosaurs walked with the watcher angels they left footprints the angels in the ground and scientists are still trying to figure out how they can make it into cavemen because they have blocks of like stone with a put a human footprint they think and dinosaur prince god put water angels on the earth to care for them watch your angels yeah they had flesh on them this is a reality movie this is reality movie night and they were here to care for the dinosaurs and god said well i'm not tolerating this anymore you know he's going to take over the earth so god broke the water vapor shield that covered the earth to put mist on the ground so the dinosaur skin wouldn't fall off there had been no storms on the earth at one point until of course they heard cracks of lightning and then here comes all the other stuff on the earth he began to make it a wilderness god wasn't going to tolerate it so the water vapor shield he put around the earth which every one of your family members has already seen this in heaven you go into this place called creation lab and god recorded all of it you get to actually see how he made the heavens and the earth they know how all of it happened isn't that amazing so everybody gets to find that out they know a whole lot up there and so yeah so god broke the water of april shield it flooded the earth until he covered the whole earth and then he blew on it and froze it and there is satan with all of his plans washed down the tubes again because now he's got a block of ice and he can do nothing on it and there's the ice age somebody didn't enjoy it god removed his glory off the earth and it said darkness covered the earth and then we have verse two [Music] that was all in verse one then comes verse two and darkness was on the face of the deep right the spirit of god was hovering over the waters is that correct over the waters he didn't say there was ground over the waters because in the beginning he made it and it was good he created in the beginning of time and space he made this plane to earth and it was finished it was finished and it was good create ted he created that was past tense right and then we come to verse two so something happened between those two verses a whole lot because then he starts to take it apart and put it back together is that what he says yes there was water on everything water on the sky water on the land he took the water off the firmament that was the air that was the sky that was in the ground of the ground i'm doing my motions again people my staff say don't do that my hands move okay i can't we help it he began to take it apart it clearly explains to you what he did right so he was going to recreate the earth or he would not have told the animals to replenish the earth did you get that word re that's like you remodel your home you can't remodel a home that was never there you can't replenish the earth if it wasn't there before so that's what he did everybody in heaven has already seen everything i'm telling you about he began to take everything apart right so that he could then redo the earth and then he began to make the animals and all the life back on the earth all the growth was back on the earth again and then he did something different than he hadn't done before he was going to make man in that amazing and then there was the word stepped out of the father began to form adam's body and he looks pretty good i've seen adam and eve in heaven yes they have clothes and yes you will have clothing you actually get a wardrobe he can afford more than two garments for you aren't you glad [Music] i get asked that question all the time you well your soul's exposed on your shoes though the soul's exposed yeah ask somebody what the sole your foot is if you need help just take your shoe off and look at it the soles exposed on your on the bottom of your foot you're always touching the ground to heaven they still have boots they have sandals they have all kinds of shoes there to wear beautiful things amazing things and some of them talk to you your clothing will change colors and your clothes will change on you while you're walking down the street if you cannot decide what you should have worn and you picked out three things as you walk each one will come on you women [Applause] heaven is not normal concerning this earth it's heaven where eye has not seen your ear heard or entered in the heart or mind of me and god's prepared for those that love him except in the last it's revealed by thee spirit of god so that means it can be revealed right he's doing that at an accelerated rate and he's shown me a lot on purpose so he wasted hell i'm going to go back to the third day that's okay he wasted hell the first day christ goes well i'm not going to touch him on wait and see if god rescues him and he didn't come and he had taken him into the they had grabbed and put him in the far reaches not the outer reaches i've seen there too you don't want to know about the outer reaches of hell okay the far reaches of hell they dragged him back what good is that going to do if the god of if he shows up right what are you going to do you can't hide anything nothing is hidden from god but they thought well we'll just put him back here and hold him well the second day came and he didn't show up so satan's thinking well i am and now i'm stronger than him i was smarter than him but it didn't work but he still lost part of his brain because he really thought he was going to win and he was going to put on a show to torture the son of god in front of all of his hierarchy so he sent out a message for all the principalities and powers come in and sit on the front row and he moved it from the back of hell to the front where the gates are there's a courtyard the gates of hell the really gates there and they could see from abraham's muslims he couldn't put a show on the only ones who could see would be abraham's bosom right he's going to put a show on showing that he's more powerful than god i'm a torch of the son of god he wasn't the one that was going to torture so here comes the third day right he's got everything set up all the prince pallies and powers the big guys are all sitting right there in the front row i actually was i saw that i was there i saw all the little demons screaming and yelling all they do is scream and yell and complain complain and yell and blaspheme and complain and yell and blaspheme they they all the time because they're they're always everybody none of those demons like each other they want to out do outlie out cheat whatever they can that's what they do to each other and so they were like they were full of themselves because they were on the front row and all the other ones were behind them in a little while though they were going to be glad they weren't on the front row satan put all his uh cleanly attire on he had made and uh all of his faults gems well he had the gems god still put on him if you didn't know god put gemstones on him for a reason he had a reason he put he made mountings like in a ring and set these amazing beautiful gems there were like thousands of them on him and he was glorious he was glorious so he still had that glory he thought it was his he's going to lose it if you know what the word says it says christ what'd he do say it loud yeah that's what he stripped he took every single gemstone off of him that god put on him so here's the show's about to begin satan's going to put on a show he was talking all of his hierarchy right and here's jesus not saying a word just like his father he wasn't saying a word and then all of a sudden there was a role of thunder and all of hell's attention was gotten because they remembered what happens after that roll of thunder comes lightning is going to show up somewhere and then jesus christ stands up and there is a shout from heaven and jesus christ starts releasing the fire of god from himself and melted the faces of all the hierarchy of hell he began to they began to burn in the midst of hell fire with the fire of god literally like blue fire was shooting on his hands and i saw them melt like wax because as a little girl i would see them in different places i saw these demons and their faces were melted like that and like wax and i used to think what is that what did that what did that well i was about to find out and i mean literally saw them melted it says he ruined and spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of it openly and that's what he did he literally ruined them they can't go back they've never been able to fix their self okay satan can't fix you if you're in the army of darkness and you get wounded he can't heal you they got parts missing you can't you can't make them cease to exist but they get wounded they don't get healed okay i've seen them the holy spirit calls them shabby debris and if you knew holy spirit like that's exactly what he would say because i see the hosts going across the sky all the time i'm a seer i see them i see the demonic armies after they've been in a battle with the host of heaven they're hanging out for dear life because nobody wants to help each other like hanging on they have these horrific looks on their face because they have just been wiped out by the host of heaven and i said man they look really bad and the holy spirit said i call that shabby debris and they go i can't think of a better thing to call it because they look like debris you know something washes up on the shore where parts of it are missing that was them we better be glad they don't work together well right we're glad they don't even like each other right because the hosts look out for each other they protect each other look out for each other they're there for each other hell is just the opposite nobody cares about anybody so here comes shabby debris they look like shabby debris that day in hell and this is what jesus was saying you will never have the power to hold a righteous man in this place and anyone who received christ they will never be able to take you there or hold you there amen yeah and when he was done wasting the principalities and powers then he turns to their leader they ran they didn't wait around to see what was going to happen to him they abandoned him they left him they were running over top of the little demons trying to get out of the space they were happy they weren't on the front row that day it worked on their behalf and all of abraham's bosom were shouting and cheering and yelling and celebrating [Applause] because they'd already given themselves to him now there is their messiah wiping out the devil he he literally he literally ripped his clothes off threw him on the dirt and one by one took every single gemstone away from him and he was left with none it was ugly because all he had was these spiky little settings that god had put all over in his wings and his beings he was decorated by god and now he has put false ones in there he's made false ones they don't look anything like what he did but he was he was utterly totally completely defeated he is a doormat he is not over you he is under you he is under our feet so what is under your feet under your feet is a doormat isn't that what he says then don't be afraid of him we're not supposed to have any fear in us right and the fear of the lord is not that you will be afraid that he will hurt you it is you are afraid you will hurt him you're so in love with him you don't want to do anything that would hurt the lord that's what the fear of the lord is the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and with all your getting of wisdom get understanding which is knowledge of the holy one don't you don't you love the word i love it isn't that good so there you go that was a reality show from heaven and then he did the the most the greatest insult he did to satan was to take something that not just his he took you know he had no pride left really out utterly stripped him of all his glory and he fell because of that glory but he did something even worse than that he took away authority he took away authority that he had gained because adam gave it to him and he had been ruling with that authority until something changed that's one of the reasons why christ had to come he had to come he had to walk as a man like you and i choosing not to sin say not to sin he had to choose that with his own will not to sin because him being not just righteous but holy okay and then him being going into hell and they think that they could keep him it was devastating to the enemy when he realized we should have never taken him because it said if they had known they would have never done it right it was bushwhack time the enemy was bushwhacked by the son of god and so he stands there after he stripped all this all the gemstones off of him he reaches down and takes away the keys keys represent authority they have always represented authority and you know that if the wealthiest man in a city back in christ's time and even before that the wealthiest people were given the keys to the city did you know that that's not just something we do here on earth you know when you see someone comes to hollywood or they come to a state they've done something great like oral robots was actually given the key to oklahoma city by the mayor the mayor of the governor one of them and they actually redeemed their self because they were not on god's high list because of the way they had treated oral roberts they scorned him they made fun of him they judged him criticized him in the media and the newspapers but before he died somebody got smart and they apologized to him in public they gave him the key to the city not just the city actually they gave him to see the key to that city but also i think the governor and the mayor were both there apologized repented on behalf of all those who had mistreated him recognized him for the contribution that he had done for them and so they gave him the key to the city that's still significant today when you have a key but the wealthy people were always sat in the city gate back in jesus times and before that in abraham's day the wealthy people sat in the city gate with the elders and they were recognized because they they gave contributions to help the city and so they were given keys and they were given money backs and they had authority they had a say over what went on in that city they were recognized by their wisdom because of their wealth and so that's just something that's always been well he lost all of it in hell that day he lost all of his authority all of his glory all of his a lot of respect from the demonic because they realized then at that very moment our lives aren't going to be the same because now we can be wasted by anyone who is righteous can waste us everyone who receives him will now have power over us so their lives were changing even satan's life was changing he had to get a lot better deception because he no longer had those keys to hell death in the grave i'm i probably won't have time to go into tonight but christ uses those keys he uses them for us you should be really happy about that amen we have so many promises given to no no one else in the earth except those who've received jesus christ you have great power on the inside of you have great authority you have already been given dominion on the earth don't don't act like you're nothing don't say you're nothing you have great value everybody person everyone here is valued by god everyone here was given a gift to use in the natural realm in heaven you're going to use that gift whether it's baking cookies making a really amazing barbecue designing apparel designing interior design designing amusement parks making movies in heaven uh sports in heaven are played as worship yet are really quiet how many people have never heard me talk about this before i know somebody who has let me see your hands okay it makes sense because god gave you that gift they are irrevocable as a matter of fact even the wicked have their gifts and they won't be taken away from them you choose how to use that gift in the earth that's why there's people who belong to satan and they have gifts to act or sing or whatever it is and what they produce is dark because their heart is dark they're going to have the gifts no matter what amen but your gift is so important that that god calls it precious is something special he calls you you are a gift every good and perfect gift that's you comes down from the father of lights that was you you were light you were made out of light he knit you together in your mother's womb at the time of conception that spiritual body made out of light was knit together with that physical little dot of flesh and that's when life begins but when you came you had you were that gift already whether it was someone who was going to sing or be a musician dance create a clothing apparel food spices roads highways anything you see in this place was created by somebody it was designed and invented by somebody you wouldn't have anything to wear to walk on to sleep on to sit on to look at entertainment places to go and enjoy yourself you wouldn't have highways to drive on planes to go in those were gifts god sent people to be and all those gifts are used in heaven for everybody who lives there so it's not boring yes they have stylists there they have salons there they color your hair with light this is heaven culture everyone in heaven has color in their hair so wear it [Music] it's like art is considered a form of art okay they also have the culinary arts in heaven everybody eats food and they love it it tastes better than anything you've had on the earth and don't argue with me because the mirror's supper of the lamb is not grapes and crackers if the lord of glory was going to have a supper he made everything that ever existed he's not going to give you just grapes there'll be unending food everywhere everything you love to eat with no weight gain or food allergies and i i happen to know that that wedding supper is going to last a long long [Music] time he has a really big house [Laughter] this is just reality time i guess we're having a reality heaven show of things that happen throughout time okay even elijah loves to tell the story of the prophets of baal because he saw what happened in the spirit realm when all that went on so when you go to heaven now and he shares it it has a whole different meaning like when you get to heaven and you get to see how christ wasted hell you will shout and scream forever there was the day satan was kicked out there was a day he was crushed down he had authority stripped from him he was unseated from his authority that he operated in the earth for generations and ages because something new was happening the messiah was on the earth and then he went and died for us so that every every sin you ever commit when you repent and say when i repent it will be forgiven he will cleanse me from all unrighteousness like it never happened heaven absolutely celebrates every time somebody gives herself to christ especially all the family members who never get to never miss it every family member saw all of your family get born again they saw the babies being born they saw the weddings every birthday on your birthday they go in heaven get a gift and put it in your mansion that's being built so when you come there every year you were apart they have a gift for you you got a lot of family you'll have them up to the ceiling probably going out the doors your pets will be there taking over your mansion if you had a whole lot you probably have heaven's zoo because he has a sense of humor beyond not just his creativity is beyond what you imagine his humor is beyond anything you imagined and you will not stop laughing okay you will laugh till you fall on the streets of gold and people step over you everybody wants to know you the disciples will come to greet you the prophets we have prophets watching us right now from heaven they're watching this meeting right now while i talk about them okay we have the the ancient prophets we have the new ones who just passed home to heaven and are enjoying their reward and their celebration in the throne room i know i've already seen kim clement up there i've seen oral roberts billy joe daughtry i've seen many people great men and women of god i've seen them in heaven i've seen celebrities in heaven that made it up there like john wayne lives in cowboy heaven did you think they wouldn't have on what was his gift cowboy movies and they don't even have to have ratings on them aren't you glad all family friendly every single one of them when i used to speak in hollywood i would say if you don't want to use that gift you better you better go to heaven because you won't use it down there not only do not have breakfast in hell they don't have movies in hell either okay you don't get popcorn you get nothing in heaven you have this little menu that appears and you pick what you want and there's your food right there while you watch the movie the movie that is being captured probably not far from where you're at shown instantaneously in these cedars in heaven they're called reality theaters it was the very first place they took me they could have taken me anywhere in 1996 i was caught up to heaven for the first time jesus warned me walked through the wall of my home while i was doing dishes although i spent a lot of time in prayer it wasn't during that time he walked in while i was washing dishes not my favorite thing to do i tell people i'm not susie homemaker okay i am a business person but of course i raised three daughters i was a wife i had to take care of my home while i was doing everything else at the same time and so jesus walked through the wall of my home he said go sit down the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and i didn't say no and the first place it took me was to have a fun place because i knew there was a throne room i knew there were certain places already in heaven i knew they were there i knew about the river of life it talks about it in the word of god it says heaven is a country and it's a city so i knew they had both even if i hadn't seen them i knew they were both there go read hebrews 8. correct it's in hebrew right it says heaven is a city it's a country yeah so go read and hebrews actually talks a lot about heaven that's where the great cloud of witnesses is talked about the great people of faith have passed on to so go read hebrews it talks about heaven so i knew there were certain things there but and i was delighted i thought there was probably something fun to do i didn't realize that heaven is almost 50 50. half fun and half profound when his children came home he had to have something for them to enjoy and do and so yeah i was the first place i was taken uh jesus came in the person yes i knew it was him i'd actually seen him cut a few times on the earth before he walked through the wall of my home i've known him since i was four years old i got saved twice age four and age five and this was 1996 when this happened so i had had encounters with angels i could see i was always a seer i'd see the demonic operations i see heaven's operations all around me my grandmother had some of that in her my dad had encounters with angels it was a way of life it wasn't like strange something strange to me but it was absolutely delightful to see that there's so many fun things to do in heaven and what's in my books are encounters i had and how people got stunned when god would take me up let me stand by their family members who had just passed away i heard them talking about their life on earth i knew the family members names i knew what they looked like even though i had never met them on the earth then god would walk me through their mansions i would see how the mansion was built i knew what was on their property and then he would bring me back down and then he would give me their family members names and phone numbers on the earth if he can take you to heaven and show you stuff if he knows there'll be hair on your head he knows all your phone numbers right and i would write it down he'd have me call he'd have me type everything down i heard and saw and then it would call these people and say i didn't have pink hair back then when i used to do that okay he still shows me people but but when i started this whole thing i didn't have pain care and i say uh i believe god has shown me something about your family member in heaven would you like to know what it is and i didn't know these people i i didn't know they didn't even know how i got their number i didn't want to tell my got their number i just said god has shown me something and they will go who are you talking about and i say their family member's name they would get they would i couldn't see but i knew they were shaking on the other end of the line and they go uh yes i want to know will you meet me at the mall will you meet me at the park because they sure weren't going to invite me to their home they never wanted to take me to their home they never ever ever took me to their home and i would show up and i would have everything typed down on a piece of paper god even gave it a title did you know god loves to name things he gave it a title like it was a script and i wrote it like it was a script i put everything in quotes that jesus said that i heard them say you know i described the aromas the emotions the colors everything the frequencies that were there how they traveled what was in their mansion what it looked like what their favorite colors were what their gift was because they were using their gift and i didn't know anything about them and i tell them to sit down and i would hold the paper up here so i didn't look at them and i just began to read and i would hear them laugh and cry and cry and laugh and laugh and cry and they would shake and when i was done i'd say do you believe god showed me this about your family member in heaven and it wasn't for me it was for them and they go i don't know you i never met you but you told me things only my family member would know so i have to believe you saw my family member they were so absolutely undone and then they began to tell me they confirmed what i saw because i knew what they were doing and i knew what their gift was because you used that gift in heaven whether they were a florist in heaven or they're designing apparel in heaven uh whether they were over the youth in heaven which the 13 year old girl was put over the youth of heaven and she was 13. and her whole life she planned to be a youth pastor and she met her kids in her elementary school in her middle school everybody loved her i heard from her mother after i shared all the stuff i saw her with her great grandfather that looked like he was in his 20s and he was taking her on rollercoaster rides in the amusement park and i mean huge roller coasters like the biggest one is called the rush it leaps off the track goes across the sky to another part of the track yeah i thought that was pretty cool and the wild thing was the angels were riding them too they were riding them too i could not see the end of this amusement park i've been there three times i could not see the end to it kids got in bubbles and rode over it in bubbles or you went by you went and learned how to fly like superman then you flew over it guess who teaches you how to fly christopher reeves i hear your thoughts he got born again he got born again what did he do on earth he was superman right he teaches you to fly in heaven so i'm telling you this is all this is in my first trip to heaven and i remember every aroma every emotion i remember i remember every word that people said i remember every creature that i saw what they look like their flowers saying they changed colors the host of heaven were there there was these beautiful angels that were green like dust like green emerald dust stepped out the waterfalls and they cared for the waterfalls and the streams in heaven and they were feminine looking they were so captivating their song was so captivating so i remember all that in my first trip and christ i remember christ took me aside before he brought me back and he goes i want you to tell them on the earth there'll be many people in heaven they never expected to see there but they prayed them in if they don't give up on them we will not give up on them if you belong to me i won't let your words drop to the ground and i got undone i think it was the most spectacular thing that happened when i was there was when he told me that because he said it will give hope to so many people because he's a good god isn't he and so i saw this young girl was talking to her great grandfather as they're walking down this path going through when you're going into a new part of heaven there's gates that are always open there's just like columns with gates there's not walls inside heaven and and that's they were going through these big purple and gold gates and they were going to the amusement park i didn't know that at the time and so the lord said get up there so you can hear what that young girl is saying and she was talking about her mom that they had a great relationship when i see my mom again i'm going to kiss her on both cheeks i'm going to share everything that's happened to me up here in heaven i wish she knew i was a youth leader in heaven and then and she just kept talking then i saw them go on a roller coaster ride and then christ brought me back and i got her mom's number and called her and the funeral had just happened and she was her at that time her only daughter and uh although i was told later that she was profited over by a prophetess that she would have a very short life but she wouldn't pack the whole world for christ which she was because of the testimony and so when i was sharing this with her mom outside jc penney's at a table at the mall she got undone and she began to tell me after i told her all the stuff i saw i saw on the roller coasters i heard the words that she said and she she was crying and weeping and she said that what i told you i've never known you've never met you i've never don't know you but you said things only my daughter knew she goes the day before she died the day before they buried her i was in her room and i saw a journal under her bed that was written she was like seven her daughter was 13 when she passed away she said i start to go through it and look at the pages and i found written on the pages these words last night i dreamed i died early and went to heaven early i saw my great grandfather and i went on roller coaster rides i didn't know that journal was there it was wonderful but he only gave me a peak so as fast as the roller coaster i fell back to earth and her mother was the only one who knew about that journal and i didn't know her mother you know what god was doing he was giving me evidence that heaven was not only real but it was fun she said her daughter every day would kiss her on both cheeks before she went to school when she came on she shared everything that had happened to her life in her life during that day and she had planned her whole life to be a leader a youth pastor and a leader that was her goal and she was doing that in heaven at age 13. i heard her say you know that um i'm cheering my mom on you know she didn't know she couldn't see me okay people never saw me in heaven but i heard all these words and she said that she was a cheerleader and her favorite colors were blue and white she was wearing a blue white tunic top and pant when i saw her it was her favorite color even on earth so you still have your favorite colors in heaven and so all these things everything i said that i wrote down that i remembered was significant to her she's never been the same since then she said she was my only daughter they tell me i can't have children god said tell her that she will have children i'll give her children and she has two twins right now ten-year-old twins with strawberry blonde hair like marissa had blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair twins and they have encounters in heaven so we have a good god that cares about you that cares about me you won't miss your destiny when you go to heaven none of your children will miss their destiny whatever he chose them to be here and that gift he gave them if it was a dancer there'll be a dancer in heaven if it was a cookie baker there'd be a cookie baker in heaven if it was a fisherman there'll be a fisherman in heaven if it was to create and invent all kinds of neat a high-tech gadgets they actually have a place called techno city in heaven where all the geeks live and they can create all kinds of just the wildest craziest things you even beyond what we have here on the earth although i saw some of those being brought to the earth because they have an idea zone in heaven and you see all these little sparkles in it like a million little pieces of glitter and every one of them is an idea an invention and god sends he takes a wave of that and sends it over the earth and it drops all these ideas and inventions in our minds and whoever grabs that idea and creates that idea that's why i see things on the earth already that i've seen in heaven they come from him does it say that they come from him yeah that's how he sends them isn't that amazing so god has a lot of plans for us right here on this earth right now everybody in here is special because you're alive right now everyone in heaven is cheering you on to run your to run your race right now in this kingdom age to live heaven culture to demonstrate and manifest for god it's not about how much education you've had it's not about what race you're born in it has nothing to do with any of that it has to do that you belong to jesus christ that you have given your life to him you've received him he put you here for a purpose he gave you authority power weapons he's now going to add to that creativity and invention say i receive it and he's also right now in this time and people are always asking me you know when are you going to start creating things and put it in the marketplace because i will create heaven on earth not just reveal heaven on earth my first assignment was to reveal it my second one is to create it we're going to create many products and things they have in heaven apparel games things for children we're going to produce movies in the earth places to go for entertainment for everybody to enjoy architecture interior design we're going to create walls that will talk to you and they will have movement in them you won't just paint your walls anymore you won't paint them you want wallpaper you're going to get parts of heaven and put them on there new technology is coming where you'll learn how to paint masterpieces with a light wand i saw people with drive-through tattoo powers and they put it on with light like what marking belongs to god it was stolen by the enemy and he put his marks on people for generations there's a scripture in psalms that says some people worship me in in song some and dance and some will put my marks on them joyce meyers read that now she's getting a tattoo if joyce myers can do i don't know who can say i'm not going to do it i don't know anybody who is as conservative and real as joyce i love joyce everybody say thank god for joyce she keeps us real doesn't she i can't wait to see what she's going to pick we're living in a new time like i was explaining john the baptist brought a new time with him there were new ways to do things okay that had nothing to do with the past and a lot of people rejected it because they knew god had said to do it this way well in that time he did things a certain way he himself does never change but he is a great creator and he does bring new things to the earth all the time and people go well if i can't see it line by line written well it doesn't say he's going to have microwaves do you have one it doesn't say he'll have cell phones but do you own one okay it doesn't even talk about cars but do you have one yes because as time goes by new things are brought to the earth and invented that we use to to improve our life is that correct that so that doesn't mean there's going to be that you won't see new things you've never seen before and these are things i'm talking about that will help all of humanity to either in to either make your life easier or to make you have a happier life a healthier life a more informed life there are new things coming to this earth i saw roads that we traveled on that were made out of light and the fuel was the light i'm glad someone's excited [Laughter] i i was shown these new things we will have hologram computers we can reach in and take the things out of the light and look at them and put them back in there i saw several major diseases including cancer that did not even exist on the earth it'll be abolished just think how much that'll change your life new fuels one is coming from outer space are you all excited saying man because you're staring at me do you know how much that will change our life we won't need the fuel from the desert or the sheiks we won't even need the coal from underground okay we won't even need solar energy i'm not talking about solar energy a whole fuel that god already put up there and all they need is the night the right receiver to bring it down in the transmitters in everybody's home to fuel your entire home and i saw what they look like they're about this big and you can move it wherever you want to you go in the middle of desert and camp and have have energy your bug zappers won't be fly swatters anymore because i take one when i go and i want one that big because i don't like bugs when i was 16 at a youth camp and i was finally invited to a banquet by someone who was brave my mama bought me this pretty dress had white lace sleeves to here and my neck was up to here and i went and took that thing that was hanging in the cabin i put on a walk-out to go meet my date for the banquet and something was moving up my sleeve i already told you i don't like it want no little bug it was this big and it was crawling up my arm this way and i was really shy so i wasn't going to tell anybody it was one of those grasshoppers black and red ones you know those things look like they came either from hell or from some other planet they look like they could take over the world and wanted to they had an attitude if you ever looked him in the eye i wouldn't i wouldn't suggest you do that when i'm i'm here like this right trying to calmly talk first time in my life i went anywhere with the opposite sex at all i got this pretty dress on and and the sleeves you know i was i was i was real skinny i mean real skinny and so that's the only reason why that thing was able to get up there and i've got lace you know lace does not move okay you can't open it up and shake something out so this thing is crawling further and further and i'm like i'm trying to hang on to it right and i'm like i thought it was gonna faint in front of them that's not gonna be a good first impression excuse me and i i was a really fast runner i chased my brothers all the time from my mama i ran so fast back to that cab and locked the door and i threw everything off i was going to take everything and there was that big oaky thing this big i didn't kill it i didn't want to go anywhere near i'm like what i'm gonna do i had to wait for it to walk away from my clothes so i could put him back on and go back out there you know about 15 minutes later and he goes are you okay i am i'm really good i'm all good right now and i sent my friends in the cabin to for the demise of the grasshopper so when i go camping i take big things to deal with the bugs but when you get this energy from space okay you can get the biggest bug zapper and probably put it around your entire tent so anything that comes out there is going to get zapped before it ever gets inside it was the most amazing thing it was just like a they had this thing that you pulled it down from space and everybody had them they just had them in their homes i saw them line highways and a hologram light they didn't have lamp posts like solid like this they had little things like this and all they did was have to place them where they went and attached them to the ground they had one little station a little kind of a thing like that and when they hit it the lights shot up from the ground and let the entire highway all the way down you didn't have to dig in the ground plant wiring run all the way down somewhere and hook it up to something this was a new form of energy that will change our world the missionaries wherever they are they can have power all the time no matter where you are out in the ocean on a boat it doesn't matter where you are because it's going to draw it down from space and he took me quite a while showing me this took me into the future and showed me someone this is going to be a great day for everybody and he said in your life in your lifetime which is probably forever it is going to happen i'm not planning to die i don't know about you i'm staying till he's done with me i'll let him choose that amen [Music] i'm not planning to escape by my rapture rug because even we can't decide that right so i'm just trying i'm just trying to share a little bit about what is coming into your lives it will affect you your kids your grandchildren great grandchildren great great great great great great grandchildren [Music] there have been quite a few people that have been caught up and taken over 100 years into the future i've been taking almost 150 years into the future and the perils times had not happened but it got better and greater and more powerful because the body of christ was standing up and being who god called them to be they no longer tolerated darkness or evil they weren't participating with it by by complaining and saying what they didn't have and who they weren't they stopped saying words of negativity you can't live a positive prosperous life if your soul is continually being fed negative words you just can't do it and actually if all you do is take in the doom and gloom you're not even going to be happy do you know god told me in order to create an event you had to be happy you had to be happy you know actually isn't happy better than sad do you know there's more things released in your body that are good when you are happy when you're sad and oppression comes things start changing even inside the way that your body is forming i don't know all those details about that okay i don't know those details don't care about them i just know that your inward workings of your body begin to not be good and if you live around negativity all the time then that's not good for you but you can change the atmosphere even where you live go in your room and say i'm not participating with all these words i'm evicting all these words out of the atmosphere of where i live i don't have to tolerate them i'm releasing the life of god the power of god the presence of god right here this is the atmosphere i'm gonna breathe it doesn't matter who owns that place if you were there you have the right to change the atmosphere you live in you can imagine if the body of christ ever gets this about the new time and starts operating like that how much change are we going to bring we were sent here to help change things is that right christ came and changed many things just a few short years he was here he rocked this world it's our time to put on a show this is all about the show begins you saw you heard about the show in heaven and let me tell you when all that was going on of the deception of the angels it wasn't just like calmly quietly done that's not the way it was done it was great deception and lucifer never told them i'm going to take over and be evil and kill steal and destroy he didn't say that to any of those angels he said i'm going to be greater than god i care more i'm wiser he doesn't know what i'm doing he doesn't know what i'm saying so i'm going to make sure everybody has wealth everybody has power we can all celebrate together while i rule and then he would have his own concerts and said he trafficked his wares he showed off that he could create because he was highly anointed for that and he would do that and he'd draw angels to himself let me tell you a third of them followed him but two-thirds didn't follow him and angels are real beings like you and i they're not married okay god had some mercy on them i'll be married 40 years to the same human being this november and i'm not picking anyone else okay been through it once didn't just survive but i'm victorious i actually is still very much in love with my husband and everybody knows it's a journey isn't it you learn to love and die and love and die and love and die and love and die to someone dies more than the other there's a lot more love and then you keep loving having grace so they can finish dying to their self and then it's wonderful [Laughter] but you won't be married in heaven you'll be best friends you'll remember you were married you'll do things all over heaven together and you will show off who is your husband who is your wife on the earth you celebrate all over heaven you go look at isn't she gorgeous it's the most beautiful thing you've seen this is who i was married to on earth yeah and they won't talk about any of the hard times they won't talk about any of the crazy times okay oh you share them if you had pets you share them because you live right next door and you're i was a you're parent are you a better parent they'll probably visit you more often you share them it's like children like when when um when parents come home to heaven if you if you had a miscarried little baby and you get that little baby you share them they stay with the mother stay with the father but this is it most of those people go everywhere together in heaven and and there's no like there's not like sleepovers okay although people move in and stay with you for a while i'm just preparing you i'm giving you a heads up warning right now when you come home to heaven all of your family will move into your mansion they probably already got their space picked out because they have missed you and they want to be with you okay this is a good news if you're going on a tour tell them to enjoy their self till you get back only they're probably going to follow you on the tour everybody goes on tours of heaven it doesn't matter if you stay with each other it doesn't matter okay i saw a whole i call them community mansions it was like a big hub like a big huge massive common area like probably like half of denver and off of this this com common area which was so supernatural was things you all enjoyed doing together on the earth it was uh even if it could include outdoor stuff by the way you can't say it was all like under a building no i'm talking about it was everything you enjoyed doing on the earth together as a family and then off of this are all these massive mansions coming off almost like a wheel with spokes and every spoke would be like i don't know i saw mansions the size of a city so i can't ever even say how big these mansions were and so everybody had their own space because you come home as his son and his daughter okay that's how you come home because he is your father when you come home he recognizes your son and your daughter and he gives everybody their own space and you will be very glad you have it you will love whatever it gives you to be so supernatural you could never afford to pay for it buy it or even build it here and it's going to be built around your gift the thing that is your passion that you love the most and then you go on tours all over heaven and christ invites you to his own private mansion where he throws a big party for you and invites all the disciples the apostles the prophets to come and see you and they're coming there to meet you he sends a special chariot or carriage to come and pick you up and then he has you decked out like a king or a queen and then you come and he escorts you into his place and introduces you and everybody celebrates that you're there and then you eat like forever [Music] he has a massive ballroom is the biggest part of his mansion because he loves to dance and on all the all down the walls are like king's tables laden with every kind of dessert you can imagine and his mansion sits in this field of flowers that are like six foot tall all of them sing the most glorious songs they are worshiping the lord of glory they will all know your name they will all welcome you as you come down this magnificent drive to say everybody say jesus deserves his own place just like us and he has one but he made a way so that you will never be away from him do y'all like this reality show tonight [Laughter] some people are hearing it for the first time if we're live streaming are we live streaming some some of these people for the first time in their life are probably getting rocked you know their mind is probably still going bonk after the first time i talk to them about something because that's what heaven does to you when you get there you walk around like you don't even know what to say you're looking at everything you're undone by the ground by the grass by the sky by the beings by the sounds the images of frequencies people riding on their worship you know i mean beams of light shooting by and it's a person coming from somewhere in heaven you step into these transport kiosks that are light beams shooting out and you ride on the light to places around here and you're walking down these streets of gold if you can you can look in them you can it can actually see your image in the streets of gold it looks like uh i don't know it's transparent gold but it's beautiful you can't even tell the depth of it you can't there's gems everywhere massive gems everywhere the mulch and the flower beds are gems like real gems and the angels will come sometimes and grab them up and throw them down to the earth and that's how they get in the meetings so you're you're being undone by everything that you're walking by everything that you're seeing in heaven and you'll never stop feeling that way you will never stop being undone it doesn't matter if people have been there 500 years a thousand years 2000 years they're still surprised by god he's he's always creating new things putting new things through there discovering new things it's so huge and massive you know i mean one day i don't even know if we'll get to seattle before he makes the new earth isn't that amazing i i love him i love him more every day and people go how can you carry that because he lets me he lets me carry it i have a i have a i can't even remember in the natural words anymore i have a photographic memory he gave me that from the time i was a little kid it helped a lot in school i look at a list one time you never have to look it again i remembered everything it said i'd read one thing like you know two weeks later we had a test and i would pass every test because i remember but he wanted somebody with a with a photographic memory to do this so they could remember everything i remember the thousands of times i've been there i remember everything i remember every detail i remember the aromas will get you undone the christ himself carries an aroma and i can go places and i know he was there it's beautiful it's a beautiful smell but i also smell the other side i know when they've been in places and it's putrid it smells like death so yes they both exist heaven exists hell exists just like the bible says okay you have to read the word to know it if you don't know the word then he can't bring it alive to you if you don't read the word he can't bring he can't highlight stuff i know how many people have ever happened you've read a scripture so many times in one day you read it and it comes alive to you [Applause] if you read the word you are storing it in your soul and in a moment when you need it that's how come it comes up in you because you put it there yourself when you read it i play the bible somewhere in my house and it's always feeding my soul you can feed your soul at night while you're sleeping and i don't know why more believers don't but i play powerful anointed worship 24 hours a day in my home because he inhabits the praises of his people whether it's in person or whether it's on a cd okay there's anointed sounds songs frequencies if you play and put them in your home it will draw heaven to your home you know that's what we should all put there right so y'all stand up for a minute i want to thank you for letting me share i don't want to keep it really long because i know i have to be back in the morning i was supposed to share about some of my products i there's one called revealing of the kings it's the spiritual kings in case you didn't know this revelation this is the day he's revealing these spiritual kings who will walk in the earth that's whoever runs after that those are eternal levels of authority christ said you will rule and reign with me now right and the agents to come he will rule with him throughout eternity that's not a temporary position there's lords priests and kings and he told me face to face what i have written on my thigh is not natural kings i am the king of spiritual kings who will walk in high levels of authority in the earth no man can give them that title they will demonstrate they operate in that authority and dominion in the earth and that's how people will know who they are so there are priests it says in the word we are priests and kings to our god and he's the king of king and lord of lords that's what this thing tells you about now scrolls of time to have opened the culture of honor how they live in heaven the kingdom age born again that i already told you about powerful and this one which is hilarious not theirs it's called superheroes and there i am with the superhero costume on that was not my plan kids love it so there i am a superhero you all know that if you pray for others if you stand in the gap for others then you are superheroes for heaven i went to morningstar to speak for the women and they invited me to speak to the five-year-olds i did not know now i wore i have a superhero costume it's not spandex tights okay but it's but a superhero blue pants i mean stretch is superhero blue so i would get it right and and i had my superhero shirt on and all my little things that i wear and i did not know that the bible teacher had just taught them for six weeks that they were superheroes for heaven and i didn't know that had all drawn pictures of me wearing a superhero costume because that wasn't even on the agenda that wasn't on the program for me to even speak to them but when i went to go speak to them god said you're taking that with you when i i am like like am i wearing that on the platform for like all the adults and he said no but take it and then when they said you want to speak to five-year-olds yes i will speak to them because i knew what i was going to wear and so here i come in the back of the room and all the little kids are up there giving testimonies and the bible teachers stand and he starts laughing out loud here i am in my superhero costume and all the kids start screaming and yelling so i kind of ran and i jumped into the scene it was a very memorable meeting and then they called me up front they each gave me their little picture of they drew of me isn't holy spirit awesome he set that whole thing up because i had no idea i just said yes when he said take it and i'm like okay all day good and all the little kids uh we took pictures together and i hugged them i encouraged them i told them how how pleased the father was with a great future they had on this earth and so it was something i won't forget it was also amazing so everybody hold up their hands i'm gonna i'm gonna just speak something into your life i'm a prophesy corporately he won't let me do it individually but you know what this is the time for the corporate body of christ and when i say this this is for everybody watching also hold up your hands okay i speak for the most high god and i say you will be great in the earth i say you will do greater works even than christ did i say you live in a supernatural time where you yourself will create witty ideas and inventions and bring them to mankind to change them forever i say you will walk in truth you will walk in the spirit you will move in the spirit you will travel in the spirit you will shake things you will stun hell you will carry the light of god until you shine like the stars in the heavens you will handle the wealth of the wicked you will push back darkness you will run your race with the host of heaven i declare a decree that you are priests that you are lords that you are kings unto your god receive it says your god amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] and you will live long enjoy happiness and have the most fun you've ever had in your life may you prosper be in health and may the host go with you amen

while they're doing that jesus is right behind me on the platform [Applause] [Music] he's right there [Music] [Applause] wow he has an agenda it's called america all right when she started flagging that sound you heard was his train filling the temple and there was an angel bigger than this building outside he was flapping his wings he was moving his wings and then all the others stepped through him and filled here and then jesus stepped right through that wall that's what you were feeling his presence he was overwhelmed and undone by the worship he loves the hearts of those who worship in spirit and in truth and he walked up to me and said i'm going to speak today and tell this world what i think about [Applause] america who am i i am that i am i am from the beginning and the end there is no man who has lived on this earth that i did not make that my father did not carry until they were sent here we did not create evil that was birthed in a created being because he chose it do not choose darkness it will overtake you and consume you it will blind the light we put inside of you no one will take my country no one will remove my name off of your documents or your buildings no one will remove the blood strikes on your flag [Music] no one can stand before me and say they are greater than i am for i am going to rebirth america it will be greater than it ever was before it has not even seen the peak of its greatness america is great because i created it to be great it is my gift to the nations i created it to stand with my people in israel for america is a friend of israel i hid america in their name j e r u s a l e m if you want to know where america is in the bible it's in the name of jerusalem [Applause] for i have hidden it i hid it before i birthed it the enemy wants it if he thinks he can make decrees over my country i will wipe them out [Applause] i will overturn every wicked law every evil decree i will remove every wicked person for i have chosen someone to sit in the white house and he will sit in the white house as president if you do not like him then you say nothing because you're speaking against my plan you don't know my ways and my thoughts for the generations before him in his line paid a price with their life for the kingdom he could not escape being great he's been thrown into this because i called him into this pray for him pray for everyone who he chooses that he chooses by my will but i will no longer tolerate the evil the decay in this land i will no longer that will not will not tolerate the enemy trying to overtake my country for my name is written in its documents for i was with those who wrote those documents even their names have been slandered and lies told about them i will not tolerate it this is a new age i call it the kingdom age it is time for my people to lay down their differences stop your footing you are helping the enemy i say in this day and age you come together for the world must see you loving each other you have to love each other first before you can love others my blessing falls on agreement for those leaders in my house my house not your house my house it is mine and i am taking it [Music] back those leaders in my house who are not yielding my spirit i will remove you [Applause] in this day it is critical that you work together that you love one another this is not about you being important this is not about you becoming somebody it's about you showing me my love my truth my purposes my plans lay down your plans and find out my plans because i choose to make america greater than ever was before i say the world will race after the pattern i'm going to put in america i see the world run after the products made in america for i have made america it is mine many have paid a price for this land i will not overlook their blood crying out where is justice and liberty and freedom i will not tolerate freedom being taken from this land that even the children cannot be saved in their own schools i will not tolerate it you will see the hand of your god move mightily in this land i know i made this world i do not hate the earth i made it with my own hands from my father spoke and anything you spoke i created it i even changed my very image to come here and walk amongst you i know your weaknesses i know your hurts and your pains i would no longer tolerate it in this country for light shall abound and the darkness for generations shall be pushed back regions of light and glory will be created in this country that sin and crime will not be able to abide in because i will erase even the very first steps to the demonic who have threat there [Applause] but you must stand up and decree and declare and make rulings for in this time my kings my spiritual kings will lay out decrees and rulings and i will do them because they will live holy and they will obey they will let me have my way if you want to know me you must pursue me i do not control i lead and i love but you cannot keep insisting in heaven your own way you can't have my will in your way it does not work because my father's kingdom my father's kingdom the kingdom of heaven is coming to this earth even now the hosts millions and millions of them have been sent from heaven to work with the believers to help defend them and pull down the strongholds they are your weapon in this day and age for i have chosen this time on the earth my father has chosen this time on the earth you can either participate or you can stand and watch it happen but in eternity you will be so thankful that you participated i do not want to hear any more trashing and bashing i don't want to hear evil and wickedness and darkness coming out of your mouth if you say you are mine then stop it for i have said this day i offer you life and death i said choose life because every time you speak death you will perish your soul will perish you must love but you must share the truth you cannot embrace the other false religions you are not helping them do not read their articles or their doctrines because they will clutter your soul you read my word you live by every word that is spoken every spoken word you live by it the written word is a guideline but the spoken word never stops revelation is being released from heaven like never before in this day but the enemy also is releasing deception you do not want to be caught in deception you need to be free and full of me you need to be dangerous against the plans of darkness for i created you perfectly and amazingly and then i gave you the power that i carry operate in it every day of your life it's not something you use in just a time of crisis you live in it it's a lifestyle you rule it's a lifestyle when you rule the enemy will run but i will not tolerate the words that are being spoken against this nation stop cursing it and stop asking us to curse it it says in your own papers and in your songs god bless america i cannot curse it if you have stated that you must bless america bless it in every way bless your families bless your friends even bless your enemies for when you do that it gives us the power to run after them liberty and justice we're birthed in this land the freedom to know me to worship me this land has provided for over two-thirds of the gospel to be preached to these nations of the world why would i curse it you yourselves live here are people they live here why would we curse them great change massive change forced change is now in america i will put a trumpet in the white house [Applause] and he will know me and he will hear me you don't need a preacher in the white house you need a businessman in the white house my father is in business that's why i had to be about his business i am his ceo in heaven i know how important it is business will take the gospel further than the church ever could the marketplace will touch this world with things from heaven anointings from heaven stop running around looking for a plan we have a plan is to make america greater than it ever was before i speak to my leaders if you call yourself a leader of jesus christ and start acting like me my agenda freedom and liberty for all justice for those who cry out for justice to love to share the truth i died to set men free not put them in captivity you must trust me but i am hand picking the people who will be in the white house not for one term but if we ask down for term after term after term i will have the people i want because this is the kingdom age and america will flourish and prosper and the light will grow and grow and go to the world it'll be a pattern of what i'm going to do to all those other countries so you my people and the other countries bless america pray for america you will be seating for the change in your own country i know that i have revivals in many other countries great revivals they were powerful i will not bring up no revival i am coming for a habitation not a visitation this day i vote i vote i vote and i am voting for donald trump he will hear my voice i will put those around him that hear my voice he's already selected some that hear my voice because no matter what you think about him he at least loves this country [Applause] he was born here he grew here he worked here he helped here i've always chosen many and leaders that people would not choose that's because you're not me i see the future i've been to the future you have not been there if you have a better plan present it to my father we've had many discussions and many meetings in heaven we've made great plans to release things down to the earth ideas and inventions and wealth and wealth and wealth and wealth and wealth it took money to build america it will take money to rebuild it and make it greater do not say i want you poor because i desire above all things as your soul prospers and you guard it and you feed it life and you speak life it will prosper and then you will prosper and you will be in health this is a day when you will taste of the powers of the age to come that will be my age that will be my time to sit on the throne in jerusalem but this is this day this is the time when you will rule and reign with me i've written your name on my thigh and now my garments because i am the king of the spiritual kings of this earth and i am the lord of the spiritual lords of this earth eternal positions that you will never attain to unless you are first my priest in love with me consumed by me that know me or that are pursuing me seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness sake don't leave out the righteousness his kingdom come his will be done on earth just like it is in heaven that's why you need revelation of heaven pursue it seek it for yourself but not just listen to it apply it because you will live and not die if you apply it i have given you my word this day to go around this world this is my earth and the fullness thereof and i am changing things because my people have prayed and they have repented and i will come and heal their land and heal any land where my people have prayed and asked me to come to begin to celebrate live a celebrated life [Applause] don't forget to have fun because fun is a weapon too says you're good [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] everyone stand up please going to make a declaration to the lord before he goes he just yelled you rule because i rule and the way they salute in heaven is like this i want everyone to do that and say we rule because he rules you ready we rule because he rules [Applause] wow wow i think he voted whoa can you bring my phone margaret i love it when god confirms things and he made a great distinction between himself and the father didn't he he wanted to know who he was i made a little list of things i knew he wanted me to talk about and then most of this was already in the songs of the decorations and besides i didn't know he was going to speak today i knew i would speak for him he came as the lord of glory and by the way that crown he wears his father took it off his own head and put on his sunset [Applause] he was wearing that crown i'll see if i can share a few of these things if i can remember how to operate this right now in heaven you wouldn't need this that awesome wow i knew he was coming when i saw that angel he's the head of his train when his train his train are the are the angels or the host that's what makes up his garment [Laughter] i was really figured he was coming because of the level of praise but when i saw the angel standing outside i knew he was coming i've been sitting i sat in my sanctuary one time and my pastor would always have me sit on the front row so i could sketch because i've always seen in the spirit realm he had me sit there and draw everything i saw in the spirit realm during the service and until one day when i was on the floor on the front row because jesus came in his train filled our sanctuary and then he came in in his own flaming chariot and i was sitting on that front row thinking he's gonna say something and i mean his eyes were that flames of fire his hair was white as wool his garments were so brilliant i almost couldn't look at them and his chariot stopped and he got off and came up to me i was on the floor and he said you tell my people i only came once a savior when i come back i'm coming as king [Applause] and when he just spoke he was wearing his crown [Laughter] he came as king today [Music] he wants our children to have a future [Applause] he wants our children to know how to rule kick the enemy out of their school train the kids they won't ever forget it he's serious i lost my notes shaking i'm shaking wow i've seen the father come when he comes his rainbow penetrates the building before he ever gets there i've seen him i've seen him come with the living creatures the two that carry his throne there's four around his throne but there's two that hold up the arms of his throne they have four heads you know it talks about the ones with the four hats kneeling they're about 80 foot high and their backs hold the armrest of the father's throne when it talks about the wheels the wheels come out of them and they begin to move and that throne moves like this yeah yeah he was talking about him not humans talking but they were talking to super natural humans here today and around the world if you belong to him you're a supernatural human not of this world he reminded me last night you are the aliens he has repeatedly told me there are no aliens there's no other race out there that you might happen chance find in case you don't like heaven there's heaven and there's the other place and after that if you choose that it's a lake of fire there's no other places to abide that's right i'm choosing into that i've seen the other place you don't want to go there i'm just going to keep sharing this message is called made in america so i am wearing america i've always been very patriotic i have voted in every election from the time i was 18 i voted your votes count you need to vote [Music] in this election you're going to vote for light or darkness there's no other platform that's your choices you choose light or darkness i would say choose light that same god that just spoke is about to display himself in signs and wonders around this world that he will do himself but there'll be ones that we do for him this world has to see us doing those supernatural things because we belong to a supernatural god [Applause] you need to see it the true image of the living god one who loves the one who lives holy and yet they have more fun in heaven than they do on this earth if you're going to live heaven culture you have to have fun he wants every intercessor to come out of the closet and you have fun before you go back in because fun will be your greatest weapon in this season he said you need to have all night fun parties instead of all night prayer meetings because when you come back for the prayer meetings there'll be a whole lot more powerful than when you did it before the fun this is a strange thing to the body of christ we thought they had to be serious and profound well sirius and went to sour somewhere it all went south somewhere [Applause] because when the world hears a believer they don't think wow fun they don't think wow they love us wow have you ever seen a group of people that really cared about each other that is not what they talk about then i go man i want to be like them but they will [Music] they will i saw a time in the earth when people wanted friends to be believers they wanted believers for their friends he said it sounds well but it will be popular to be the friend of a believer because jesus did that in his day i like heavens playing better than ours you can't leave the holy spirit out of anything amen i don't know if you know this but in the baptist convention i may be mistaken about the location but i'm not mistaken about the declaration that they've had a meeting and someone high up said we can no longer resist ignore or shut out the activities and the receiving of the holy spirit it literally was spoken it was either at the beginning of this year or the last part of last year spoken to the highest hierarchy in the baptist convention i i believe i'm trying to remember this correct i like to be correct but somebody was sent out to do a survey i don't know if it was to all the missionaries it was somewhere specific to look at groups of what their people were doing and they came back with a shocking report they had all fallen way behind because they visited many missionary places and the ones that were flourishing and prospering were friends with the holy spirit and then they just looked in general when they saw they began to look in general just everywhere and they were seriously shocked and very concerned for their denomination so they really went to the whoever this person was had the right and the permission to speak to them and they said we can no longer ignore this we're going to fall behind everyone else and there's no life there's life where the spirit is they're being set up for the kingdom age [Applause] because you do know the holy spirit moved his operations to planet earth now he's still in heaven because he's everywhere but he moved his operations from heaven to earth because jesus sent him here all three of them in the course of time are required because of what they did for us to move from heaven people go where's that in the bible i will tell you where it is in the bible jesus was sent first the word he was the word the host still call him the word they have worked closer with him than almost any of the other angelic beings because he is the lord of hosts he's the lord of the host he was involved in all the army activities in heaven when he used to fight for israel they fought the human beings watch out they did they did at that time they fought the human beings and and destroyed them angel wiped out i forgot 185 000 something like that it was crazy they were god's chosen people they represented him in this earth they were in trouble of course evil and wickedness which is always controlled parts of this earth and people on this earth you know the devil can't do something himself he has to have a living soul to control we've always said he needs the spirit well he does he possesses the spirit but he still has to have control of the soul because the soul is what you act with it's what you think you choose and display that would be you that's why he wants to destroy your soul that's why god has given revelation on the soul you are a living soul that is a powerful declaration that's one of the things about being a little mini god you know you're not that ye are gods it's not some wild weird thing we're not taking over heaven we're not going to become god but we're supposed to operate in the way they operate when they speak things happen when you speak down here things are supposed to happen they have creative power why do you think we create an event down here we do it because that's their likeness it's what they do really it's not hard when you get revelation of understanding of the scriptures that we were made in his image that means he has a body god hazard body the father has a body a powerful body he's magnificent his hair is white as wool i i touch it sometimes when he takes me up to the stone it's alive it's living it's moving everything in heaven has life in it it's alive he wants our earth to be alive he wants you to be alive we're supposed to be carriers of life because he carried life and centered this earth you're supposed to carry life that's his image the word was magnificent he was fully spiritual he did not look like jesus christ he changed his very appearance he didn't have flesh the father put flesh on him like melchizedek had melchizedek has flesh he's always had flesh he's ahead of a whole tribe of angels that have flesh before we were sent here angels are made in tribes that's why there's tribes on the earth that's why there's tribes in israel that wasn't a new thing god did the angels are created in tribes we had a whole tribe here today you know tribe of the host here god is very detailed and specific when he makes anything we need to be the same way he likes to use the word strategic he's very strategic in his plans right now he's got strategy laid out and designed i've been shown the next couple hundred years for america it's gonna get a whole lot better because when god steps in life comes with him truth comes with him creativity and blessings come with him this habitation you have no way can you even imagine in your mind or even myself and all that i have seen and been shown and i've seen supernatural shocking amazing things but even i cannot contain the scope of what is going to happen through this habitation and it's starting in this generation of people it's a typing group of people we're that type and group of people right now because you know why you're alive right now that's why you're included he timed your birth on the earth to be a part of this some of you may not have any idea what i'm talking about i'm talking for god this is how he talks he has a plan follow his plan you have to know him to do this okay you can't go out there and rule and reign over the darkness if you don't know jesus christ remember the seven sons of skeva that was a bad day that was a bad choice and there were seven of them not one they thought they could use his name and take over demons they got overtaken they probably never tried that again you're not going to get away with saying you're using the power of god on this day his name is holy but this is also a day of greatness and excitement and celebration and i've learned something from the father if i do not celebrate every day of my life what i do i might become weary sometimes it's hard work it's wonderful work it's amazing work i don't have a life because i gave it to him you know it's easy to celebrate god and the vision when i'm alone with him but i have to live with people who are not on the level i'm on and i want them to be there don't drag them there it does not work i'm learning to love my family until god can change them and deal with them it's not my job to deal with them i cannot stop and fix everything for everybody out there that i hear from and it pulls on my heart because i love people but i cannot fix you i give you revelation if you apply it then god's power will fix you god will not let me do personal ministry don't call my office and ask for it and then say i'm mean and ugly because i won't do it this is what god said if you obey it will all be okay i am not going to disobey him i wasn't called to be in the five-fold ministry i'm not a pastor hallelujah bless every pastor on the earth god i want supernatural blessings this day to begin to fall on their sacrifice they've given their life for they've been bitten by sheep spitting by sheep talk bad about sheep keep going yes i will they've been abandoned and rejected by sheep laughed at by sheep even the clothes they where they picked on the way they designed the church they picked at it they've pointed fingers at their family when their own family is in deep trouble you sheep straighten up amen because when you're in trouble guess who you call to help rescue you [Music] don't love your pastor when they come to rescue already be loving them it'll be a pleasure to rescue you [Applause] honor needs i tell you heaven culture honor there's love and honor honor is the second biggest thing in heaven culture you have to honor each other don't fight over what you don't believe or agree on talk about what you do [Music] every single one of you have gifts and god put them in there we need each other we are not an island to ourselves you cannot isolate yourself when you isolate yourself now i'm not talking about when god calls you away to himself he does that he used to do it to me all the time but i still had to come back in the mass and the tribe i lived in and love them and care about them not everyone in my family is happy about me no is that is that amazing i'd have to say half of them are excited the other half don't care someone come correct me i just love them i ask god to bless them i have their face at my war room and i loose the holy spirit on them all the time then there are some who are part of what i do then i gotta be there one-on-one with them where they learn to guard their soul and lose stuff from their soul this is a new time on the earth we need to live a new way okay you need to be like jesus he changed his very appearance the holy spirit was very close to him before the earth was made and they got consumed with all of us they would do things together there's a whole area beyond heaven i call it the retreat even they need to get away sometimes that's why you need to do that when god calls you apart to be with him that's one thing but getting away just to have fun is something that's just as necessary have fun with your family for heaven's sakes they need to see some fun let's all say this father i ask for it and receive funds to have fun when it comes i'll use it to have fun because that's why you're sending it we are his children we can ask more than just our basic needs being met you have not because you asked not people always think that's the spiritual side of everything but we live in a physical realm in these physical bodies it needs to have a break you need to take a break even jesus took a break from the disciples of heaven's name he needed it hard-headed i know what it's like to live with fishermen [Laughter] i know in scottish fishermen i know the scottish ways very well [Applause] and i'm irish and jewish whoa what a dynamite yeah it was quite interesting we'll be married 40 years next year it's been a wild journey [Applause] marriage is bliss in the good times in the fun times always that's why god sends the angels on assignment with the opposite kind of personality they're not given a marriage nor married they are not unhappy about that the ones that chose it before on the earth have regretted it ever since but he'll send the serious ones with the comedians there are comedian angels i have met some they're the ones that give you those awesome jokes to tell that's them [Music] that's that's who they are and they do it on assignment and the holy one profound one does not want to hear the jokes they are focused on their assignment well so is the other one he's just enjoying it while he's on it they sharpen each other and then god makes it even better he sends them home on sabbatical to have fun at the front at the playport they have a playport it's in the sky then they have to go and have fun together after they completed their assignment [Music] together you're going to get a whole new view i'm going to come and just speak about angels one time you will laugh most of the time and then you will pray for them i'm gonna keep reading i'm listening if i ever write people go you need to write a book of angels if i did it won't be what you expect we'll have the section holy profound the fun they have them i'm going to just start sharing what he said he wanted me to talk about how he made america and the people who made america great god's always had people and he would he would assign them he would anoint them is that strange he anointed people that weren't even believers he gives anointings the anointing draws people and that's why people have the ability to influence people it's an anointing sometimes the enemy gets ahold of those people and they are anointed still anointed he doesn't take the anointing away but then it draws people to the darkness and that's why we have so many dark movies and dark songs because they have darkness in them because if they were filled with light that same anointing would create amazing fantastic things that's why he's getting hollywood saved [Applause] [Music] i'll be going there next month [Music] i have a key to hollywood a key to l.a actually he even showed me the seven golden angels that stand around uh la the ones that the city was named for [Music] los angeles the city of angels the first time i went i saw them and this person who brought me started taking me to significant places so i could tell what i saw in the spirit realm i saw those seven angels they were taller than mountains and they had these vials standing over the city waiting to pour them and they poured them before i left because god had was pouring out an anointing on hollywood to help show the truth and bring light and change the producers directors the scriptwriters the special effects people [Applause] hollywood is right [Music] [Applause] they'll still make intense exciting adventurous funny movies but it will not have darkness or evil in it and if it has evil they'll be overcome and defeated by the good in there not everyone will be a bible movie but the whole the whole life of heaven and what god wants to be seen and lived on the earth will be portrayed in every movie there'll be goodness there'll be power there'll be light there'll be hope in all of them yes the blessed coast and so yeah a lot of stuff was planted in california i laugh every time i hear a prophet say it's going to fall off the face of the earth i just saw it fall off into the ocean went well you didn't see a literal thing you must have seen the darkness falling off into the ocean [Applause] he's always had people in america that would make america great our forefathers were some of those we grew up we my age grew up in school knowing the truth about them and what they did for our country and they always talked about god they talked about god we prayed every day in school remember those days in the public school we prayed [Music] that's because god created america and then he anointed people who paid for america to be great people have usually talked down the people where great wealth those people great wealth help build this country they're people who built whole states they founded host states the beginning of host states but two very wealthy people who founded almost all of florida and paid for all the universities and the hospitals and the great places and uh many the beautiful structures and buildings they were they were paid for for about two by two people so he would he would choose people with great wealth and anoint them and have the wealth because they put it back in the country he's going to do that again he's already he's already picked up people to do that and then god said in america i mean you the people he meet the people in america and he said then i set up a miracle i'd be run by the people for the people he put those words in there that was him to have freedom of liberty to worship him to separate the uh the um the government from interfering with the church not the other way around separation of church and state church is first separate church so the state cannot interfere with it that's true then what he himself talked about the gospel he had me put in there the notes i had already he already given me two-thirds of the gospel that's not for me that's from him was paid for by people in america other countries were involved they always happened great revivals happened the welsh revival there's so many in scotland where my husband's from the covenanters those people were the holy people in scotland they were powerful powerful people in ireland i can't even begin to tell you about ireland with colombo and patrick and they had friends of angels angels were their friends and they didn't worship them they sent them on assignments bangor island ireland to this day is called the valley of the angels and they still see these luminous angels in that place because of the price people paid to pay theirs so they had prices paid somewhere in our own country there was a 100-year non-stop prayer meeting and people would work for each other just as they could be in this this cycle of prayer they were crying out for god to come to this country and do something a 100 years before we were here before we who were sitting here were here they did that people have always paid a price here in america died many of them died even in the founding of it and then he made america to stand as israel's friend i already had that in my notes to stand and be a friend of israel and sometimes we weren't always that friend but that is going to change [Applause] it will change many things will change he said i established and made and birthed in america america is different from almost any other nation it is that's why they all want to come here and i know they love there's some that love where they are but people who really want true freedom and liberty they come here for that liberty and freedom there's a lot of very good moral people that come here because they know they can live they're not coming here so they can be beat up and die they're coming here to actually have a life yes and to get born again they're going to get born again i've seen i've already been shown millions at a time will run into the kingdom [Applause] millions of muslims will run into the kingdom [Applause] he didn't tell me that he showed me that he he he cannot ignore who ishmael was in case you wondered this where that whole thing came from he's not gonna he's not gonna ignore ishmael and who his father was right he said he even said they would be mighty in the land and they are they need to know the true god he said he birthed in america and made in america liberty and freedom to worship god in america more freedom in america than any other country if you don't believe that go visit the other countries there's more churches in america than anywhere someone came to our town i think we have like a thousand they came for the super bowl one thousand volunteers were all from the churches they had a plan most places that uh the super bowl comes they have all these party zones everywhere i mean everywhere's party party not the good kind of party and very little things for families we had mass family zones all over our city for all the people who came to the super bowl so they could have fun with their families we had one little tiny area downtown somewhere that was the other party zone and the super bowl committee said they would come back they had never seen such harmony and unity between the volunteers and the people in the city and they were so excited about the the thing that we welcomed all the families we had stuff at the beach we had stuff for the on the river all over our city family zones when god is in your city it is what happens amen and then he said i'm going to share some of the i'm going to give some of the first for america it's important to know about your country our military i i love that you were blowing was that the bugle what were you blowing yeah that was so god because i already had down here to talk about the military my boy this whole group is just they're all hearing what was in my notes or what he said himself if you don't have a church in this area come here he said the military he said i birthed and patterned the military here after heaven's military they have a military they have an army michael that's his job in heaven he's the archangel over the host he has a military headquarters in heaven they have barracks 200 and some feet high i couldn't see the end of those barracks and they were designed and created for one thing to destroy the actions of the army of darkness so they didn't have a job for a long time and now until lucifer decided to take over they didn't know what they were going to be doing they sure did their maneuvers really well and it's not a tourist attraction in heaven by the way people go there they don't stay long they're far too busy to stop and chat with you so now they've all been sent down here isn't that exciting for them said our military was raised up to care to care not just for this country but other countries he said america has gone and defended almost all the other world leader countries that stood for justice and freedom even the small ones who had nobody even the smallest countries they went there even if they weren't thanked they went there because we we don't like injustice our military my husband is a marine he will always be a marine he forgets embarks order sometimes i don't listen to them if i get a kiss i will listen [Music] [Applause] i am not your squadron do i look like a squadron i will show up in fatigues if that's what you want me to wear i will wear them all the time you want me to look like this then i better get a kiss [Applause] [Music] if you think god just lets me run up and ignore my husband you are so wrong you need to get our dvd and cd called passionate power yep it was something he had me activate no my husband i have to make him happy make him feel important and let him have a good time and fish as much as he wants to even though he smells like bait i celebrate when he catches a fish and when i'm gone he sends me a picture every day that's his gift so god designed uh our military he wants he wants us to have a strong military because as long as evil wicked people in the world that want to just kill destroy you have to have that strength as part of your protection and protection for others and he said they stood the our military stands for uh righteousness which means uh in order to be in the military uh tell you they deal with those who are not keeping their self in order because when you're in the military you live military you represent the military as they find out too much stuff is going on you are in trouble they want you to live right because you know that's why you're there to fight right so righteousness justice and liberty is really the hallmark of our military we need to honor them more they're going to be respected in ways we've never seen before in the future one other one other thing and and actually the father absolutely loves nasa because they show us all of his space art nasa introduced for the first time to this world god's art in outer space maybe you never thought of it that way that's how he thinks of it it's not a bunch of dust particles that came together he designed every one of those nebulas spoke them into existence and then the lord of glory made them the word stepped out and made them every one of them is put in a specific place that's why the planets aren't all falling out of the sky and by the way there's a difference in using the word universe and the word cosmos universe is just the universe it is not necessarily made by divine design but the word cosmos means a creator designed it and made it [Applause] the bible calls it the cosmos man came up with universe same thing but it is the cosmos designed by a creator and perfect design i like that word cosmic we're going to have some cosmic times on this earth [Music] nasa was birthed here in america and made in america the greatest place space exploration facility in the world was in america other countries pursued it but america made it a part of them it was also funded and paid for by the people in america we paid for all that stuff that went on and it meant something because it wasn't just discovering new places and images there were so many things created just in the course of making that possible that we all enjoy now new technology we never had before new products we never had before on the earth that increased safety and excitement and let me tell you just if you've never looked at those galleries you need to go online to nasa.com which now get this since the space exploration with humans is done they're still setting the hubble and the other one out there we're learning more and more about what god made out there so they're not they haven't stopped doing something if you ever go to the nasa center in florida it has turned into a huge facility where you can tour it learn things experience things see things they even have kids space camp to be a junior astronaut so they've not wasted all that money we've spent but they have released 99 of all the photos for free and you can get them and put them on anything and you don't have to pay for it from nasa if you go to the nasa galleries you can download download if you want something that's high def and you're going to use it for something specific you may pay a little bit for it but most of it because the people paid for it they gave it to us how about that so that was something that was made in america a first in america was nasa and then he said some of the greatest inventions and scientists were homegrown in america or america drew some of the greatest to our country because of the freedom and liberty they had to create and we have worked closely with israel and their brilliant minds that god gave them and some of our creativity worked together to bring things to this country and this time god will bring listen to us the jewish business leaders together with american business leaders to do contracts with them to do contracts in business and do projects together for the first time god is introducing and birthing and releasing in this time the kingdom age from america we're going to go ahead and pass the baskets we're going to work she's going to keep going so if you guys want to uh bless her and be a part of the offering we're going to go ahead and pass the baskets and we understand if you have to go but we're going to let cat keep going so yeah so we're going to pass the baskets all right thank you for the commercial thank you god for blessing everyone who gives to what you're doing in this time [Applause] increase them in any way every way god and i'm i am still believing and declaring the thousand-fold return the hundred-fold and thousands of return especially if you call them to be in business god let their business come into fruition let it be in their hands let them see the plan one last commercial make about to go m.z gomez gateway on mount zion then we'll just give her one check so she doesn't have a whole bunch of checksuits god is uh one another thing made in america or birth in america is the revelation and details about the kingdom age is coming from me i live here details on heaven culture and how to live that how to work with the host of heaven as your weapon and i know it's happening in other places but the fullness of the of the revelation and the detail on it he is birthing here from america as a pattern we will be a pattern the believers who live here will be a pattern for the other believers to run after that same pattern because then they will prosper and flourish and push back darkness god always raises up a type of people when he introduces something new in the earth we're it that's why you're sitting here that's why you're hearing these words so he's birthing the kingdom age the fullness and understanding of it jesus introduced it but we've never really seen the fullness of the kingdom or even understood what it was it's in all of you if jesus christ lives in you because he's an orchestrator of the kingdom age he releases it from you it's a lifestyle it's a lifestyle you live in this earth prospering and using it to build this kingdom or take this message of the kingdom because the message of the kingdom has power in it yeah it does it's the gospel parents grab your children parents grab your children there get your children it's releasing revelation as a pattern to follow to rule and reign with christ to use our powerful weapons including the host of heaven remember they're bored they have nothing to do they are not defending heaven they didn't even do anything about when lucifer fell and one-third of the angels god himself kicked him out he's always reminding the devil you have lost yeah [Applause] then his son reminded them in hell on the third day when he wasted them [Music] he wasted them in hell demonstrated that not only he had power and authority but all those who follow him have the same power and authority that he lived in it is ours now it's our time to demonstrate through our life and receiving and choosing this lifestyle we will demonstrate that same authority and power over all the power of the darkness it's because this is a new time this is exciting i'm ex i'm getting excited yes he said he said um because of what america has stood for and was created for to bless the world to be a light to the nations to become a pattern of heaven on this earth that is all of our calling to represent heaven on this earth it's wonderful to live in heaven but if it's not your time you are not going anywhere [Applause] our life spans are going to be extended in the kingdom age because we are that generation and type of people that will taste to the i'm talking about the power when jesus lives on the earth and sits in jerusalem on the throne man's lifespan will be extended for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years but there will be a generation on the earth a taste of that the power of that age well there's only one more age after this one it's the millennial age so we are that people that will experience and taste of the powers of the age to come so everybody stand up please that's why you are so important to god and the people around the world that belong to him you are important to god we are to represent heaven live heaven culture in this earth operate like christ did on this earth to bring hope jesus brought hope god is not the author of doom and gloom it is not time he could not possibly put his wrath right now because we wouldn't be able to do the things he wants us to do this is not the end of the end it's not the perilous times this is some of the greatest times on this earth oh we are totally getting the wealth of the wicked there's many ways he's going to do that i know one of the ways that we will do that is by the things we put in the marketplace that they can't create and they don't have they will race after those things in the marketplace i was sitting there today and you said the world will race after made in america products [Applause] especially china i don't know how they feel about that [Applause] i can't leave without telling you to be very careful about what you're buying check out what you're buying make sure it's a good product make sure it's not going to fall apart or explode there's other countries that have been allowed to bring things into our countries that have no guidelines for their products not even their own people are protected and they're putting they are they're putting asbestos in formaldehyde and let even in toys you can get a little i'm just telling y'all the truth okay you can get a tester you can buy a little tester i don't know where it is sometimes they give them away free probably go online and look for them i i'd go in the store and i would look at everything i'm not doing that to put fear in you i'm telling you that to protect yourself and your children that's why we need stuff made here now other countries like england and france and italy and other countries are other good solid countries that make amazing products that have guidelines for their materials but there's others that have started flooding the marketplace that have no guidelines and they shouldn't allow them in here without checking them out they should have to have the same guidelines do you agree i'm sure everyone agrees but people are not aware that almost 80 percent of all the products on the shelves are not good things i look at every label it takes a while even some of the food now is being sent overseas to be processed i will give you a tip organic farms will explode in america organic farms if you can go organic go organic they don't use pesticides they don't use fillers they don't use hormones in the in the meat and in the animals you know a long time ago they didn't really do all that until they wanted to start mass producing stuff well one of the things that will be changing in america is the way we process stuff even ourselves is going to get better i'm not telling you not to eat i'm just telling you be be aware of where you're buying stuff they have organic markets and if they don't have them you contact them and tell them to bring them here we actually ate at an organic restaurant in denver it's called mod market i'm giving them a free commercial fresh from the farm and the i think the mills mall it's near that uh that restaurant that has the bony fish on it i won't be going there if you like fish go there but we ate there and the food was delicious and it was fresh all of it was fresh so it is increasing if you if you see organic you know make sure it's a responsible company but organic farms are going to explode because there is a generation my two of my daughters fall in that 30 year old category and they refuse to give any of their children anything that is not they eat healthy they are healthy and every now and then they let them splurge you know they don't say you can't ever have a pizza but if they do they get an organic one learn to make them yourself because you can buy stuff and make good stuff amen i don't know where that came from i guess god cares he cares about you but our marketplace will majorly change in america all right we're going to all look up to heaven and we're going to do it what the lord said we're all going to say god bless america three times god bless america god bless america god bless america father right now i just impart to all of your children here god the desire to prosper and flourish and be in hell we want sickness and disease to be far from us we want prosperity to fall upon all of your children father the blessings we bless our friends everybody say i bless my friends i bless my family i bless my enemies go sick them holy spirit say i receive revelation so i can be creation [Applause] a new creation that lives heaven culture that loves god that wants his way and his will and don't forget to send the fun [Music] we love to just look up in the sky and and watch what was happening and when kat began to talk about fun i showed margaret the birds were going nuts did you see they were all of a sudden there was a whole bunch and they kept flying by and having fun and then the eagles showed up who saw the eagles oh yeah they were just going so they creation responded to that

everybody i hope you're having a great day we are right here in sunny florida and yes it's actually sunny by the way that system that the weather warriors took authority over last night is like gone gone it's gone so thank you everybody for participating and because all of this that we do belongs to god we're going to start with everyone out there asking for grace so you're going to learn something before we start our q a session you actually should do this when you first wake up in the morning i'm talking about grace for abundant life maybe you never heard about that but it's definitely in the bible there's actually a scripture which you know that should be maybe a homework assignment for everyone who's a part of this there's a scripture that says god said as a child i filled my son with my grace now this is god the father speaking it's in the word of god he is also the one who has the throne of grace jesus christ gives grace for abundant life god gives grace god jesus you all know of course that i'm up very early i didn't wear my shirt that says you know what does it say i'm not a morning person i'm not a morning person and i know you're like weirded out by this but this is my morning right now this is my morning okay now if you called me at six am i probably wouldn't even have gone to bed yet so i'm doing this because i love you so christ gives grace for eternal life that's eternal life grace that's when he died on the cross he gave we got that but the father who sits on the throne of grace come before my throne of grace to find grace for help in time of need that is abundant life grace and you know there's an action it says find it that means you come and you ask for it so as a child god the father filled his son with his grace for abundant life is one of the things that helped him survive on this earth okay that's how he could still be happy filled with god in heaven abundant life grace is fueled from heaven if you will look up to heaven every morning when you wake up and you say father i ask for and receive grace for this day like right now i feel it it feels like light electricity pouring into me a lot of people don't know this is something you can actually get every day and it's like new every day and so we're all going to do this together so everybody even here in the studio say it after i do so everybody can know they have to do it father father i ask for i ask for and receive grace and receive grace for this day for this day amen amen there you go now we are all filled with grace what does that mean that means you're going to be happy things aren't going to be bothering you for whatever you're going to go through that day you just got grace for that so you could live abundantly because christ comes to bring life and bring it more abundantly please don't forget that if it's the only thing you leave with today and i talk to you just like you right here in front of me and being 1 to 15 i have no problem communicating with people and i love people because you know i survived them was triumphant living with that whole family with our alligator in the bathtub and you know umpteen toad frogs that my seven brothers would go out and collect and my mom would have to set them free every night um so we definitely had a different household so i love all of you if you're bashing trash you know we're gonna have to we're gonna have to ban you um but we love you anyway so i'll say that right in the beginning i love everybody even those who don't want that you don't understand don't be filled with fear that god has more and it's called revelation so that's what you're going to get today as we answer these questions that you are asking and jen will take a couple from the comments you know we're gonna we're gonna we've already got a few that we're gonna answer because we've been promising a long time so we're gonna get started so uh and i do have a few more things to share later but right now we're going to start the q a session awesome let's have it jan we are ready you guys can't see me but i'm over here off to the side hi okay um all right so this question is from sharon it doesn't say where she's from okay sharon yes and uh she would like to know that since there is no night time in heaven are there bedrooms in your mansion okay i'm sure everybody heard that but this is from sharon a question from sharon she wants to know since there's no nighttime in heaven i don't know if you knew that but there isn't you know there's no shadow turning there's no darkness at all and having the there's different colors that come in the sky different times well there's not time in heaven just waves of color come to the sky of heaven which would sort of change the effect of the light coming from god himself all light in heaven comes from god there's no sun there's no moon in heaven so there's always daylight there's always light and you don't have per se a bedroom in your mansion because no one's going to be sleeping you do have special rooms in your mansion where they have beautiful lounges for you to lounge on sometimes people want to go in there and and you still go and set yourself apart to read the word and even though god is everywhere in heaven his presence is with you some people just go to a special place in their mansion and just have conversations with him sometimes your special friends visit you and so you do have like the most beautiful place the most comfortable place in your mansion would probably be like your area where you're going to lounge and relax and so but per se is a bed you don't need that and people think how lovely and wonderful well let me give you a clue in the nurseries with the millions of babies there's many nurseries all over heaven they don't sleep either can you imagine being on the list to be one of the angels that care for these little babies and you have to play with them all the time because they don't sleep either but it is wonderful to think that your body doesn't have to be restored all the time like we do on this earth your flesh needs rest and sometimes some people need more than others i sleep four hours a day sometimes three i go about 20 hours a day then i'm going inactive and my family's adapted to that but some people need eight they need 10 hours i'm so glad that i'm up for 20 hours so let's go to the next question jen okay this is there's no name on this one at all but um they wanted to know what is a cherub what is a tear-up oh that's the first time i've been asked that well it's part of the angel tribes in heaven and a chair of people normally on earth if you said the word cherub and this is an anonymous question so hello anonymous whoever you are [Laughter] you ask you did a rare thing you asked the question no one's ever asked me before it talks about the cherubim now it literally says the cherubim in heaven people say many different ways uh actually the cherubim are very different creatures in heaven they are part of the angelic tribe a chair of most people shows a little fat baby angel i have never seen any in heaven i'm not saying they aren't there i've just never seen a little fat baby angel naked no not that either and uh but a cherubim is fantastic they have eyes and all their wings they're very uh powerful beings and intelligent beings in heaven and like the living creatures it talks about in revelation 4. why don't you all go read revelation 4. guess what you get a lot of revelation about heaven itself that's when john was caught up into the heavens and he was in heaven itself and saw many things he actually saw the cherubim in heaven around the throne that had many eyes and their bodies and their wings but a cheer up like people i'm sure and all the valentine cars people i've probably been buying there's probably little baby cherubs holding a heart or something like that but but normally that's probably just in heaven if you said cherub that would be short for cherubim that would be an abbreviation for true of them who are anything but little fat baby angels so there you go that's all i'm going to give you today about the cherub they're part of the angelic tribe there you go and i'm waiting on the next question next question okay this one's like a long list but i'm not going to read all of them i think we need a drum roll for this yeah this is one person's one person now we love it when you send and ask us a question but it's kind of hard when you ask 50 or if you send five paragraphs to ask your question um it's just go to the heart of it and let's hear what okay so this is from paulette in new york hi paula from new york and she she sent seven questions but i'm only gonna do i'm only gonna do one pick one right now and maybe the other ones will show up on a podcast or something okay okay um i had it picked out where is it okay here we go where did the other races of people come from which that's a bible story so i guess she's wanting to know paulette wants to know where did all the other races of the people come from i assume she definitely means on earth right so you need to make sure you say earth or heaven where did the other race because there's races of people who died and moved to heaven too so for me i need a little bit a little bit detail so where did the other races come from on the earth well at one point there weren't races they didn't they weren't even divided into races they just had people on the earth and everyone spoke the same language and everyone spoke the same language which was kind of wild if you can imagine so everyone who'd been born on the earth at one point there was a point on the earth when everyone spoke the same language but we don't do that now and the bible does talk about the tower of babel which did happen it was something that it happened where god uh decided to separate the races and give them different languages and you can imagine when that did happen that some people after they could understand everybody for so long and back then people lived a very long time and you know i know there were some people who lived actually to be 700 years old i think enoch was only 300 that was like young back then so back in this time when for for years and years and generations had gone by everybody understood everybody and yet in the moment of a day there came a time when a lot of people didn't understand everyone else and only certain groups of people i'm sure he chose whole families and relations to those families gave them a different language and that caused those people to separate create their own groups of people and maybe even move where they could all be together so they could understand each other all the people on the earth according to the bible adam was the very first one and it talks about adam being the first man on the earth adam and then of course he created eve they were the first ones he put them in the garden of eden a lot of people know that part and then of course they had sons and then the population began to build but there came a point and it was at the time of noah that this happened this certain thing happened that that was when he got wiped out the earth because the people were so wicked so evil can you imagine that there are probably hundreds of thousands of people on the earth that they were so evil and wicked that he only kept noah and his immediate family and they were kept on the ark and the bible says from the time of noah onward everyone on the earth came from the lineage of noah so i can say what i know as far as what the scriptures say that from the time of noah everyone on this earth is related to him because of course everybody else was taken off the earth and people newly born on the earth all came from the lineage of noah so i can just say that and there was a time when the groups of people were separated by god given different languages so we'll just go with that for right now uh there is some things i may as well just add this to cause discussions between between all of you there what there are some theories that people believe after adam and eve god kept creating people now i don't know and if you find it in the word maybe you could inform us in the comments i can't find it in the world where it says every single human being came from adam and eve because the the race was all destroyed but at one point when noah was saved the word does say that from the time of noah everyone else on the earth was related from the lineage of noah so there is this possibility that people talk about all the time that god could have made adam and eve he could have made other people on the earth because he was really trying to accelerate populating the earth and there's always questions like well who did adam and eve's sons mary who did they married was it their sisters was it someone else where did other people come from i think we will all probably wait until we get to heaven to get that question answered so there you go next question okay this is actually from facebook um this is specifically for you and um they must be maybe new people that haven't heard stuff from them okay yeah there's always new people you need to consider that i'm going to add this for free there are people who find me and that's what they say it's very funny i found you on youtube i found you on facebook or i met you on youtube or i met you on facebook i met you on twitter i met you on the podcast for the first time and now we have instagram and now we have instagram hey so we're really expanding out there and so every day throughout the day there are new people discovering me so they don't know a lot of the revelation those of you who have been watching and listening for 10 years you know a lot but you still have to consider here's some new person who's watching maybe just found me by accident like oh my gosh look at that person she's got pink hair but she's talking about god okay so what is the question well it's from jonathan and patricia and it says do you leave your body when you visit heaven oh that is a very good question jonathan and patricia jonathan and patricia welcome to our q a session and that is a wonderful that's a wonderful question they want to know that when i am caught up to heaven do i leave my body because some people think where does your body go does your spirit man go and that'll give me an opportunity to answer a couple other things to make it clear i don't go in my body my physical body stays here on the earth my family all know that because if they come in my room or if i'm sitting in my desk or something else if they come up and speak to me and there's no response at all i'm just like staring saying nothing they know that my spirit man is in heaven so i am caught up by my spirit and i am taken to heaven i don't make myself go okay god's never done that with me he's always just caught me up either by the spirit of god sometimes jesus comes and just catches me by my spirit when i'm in heaven i don't look down and see my body i don't look down i am focused on what they want to show me in heaven and yes this has been going on for a long time for a very long time since early 90s i've been caught up i had got off to heaven taken on tours of heaven for the purpose of revealing to the earth what heaven is like how heaven operates what the people look like what their mansions look like places that are made in heaven things you get to do there what about your family members all kinds of things god has me reveal and i actually have a commission i he came to jesus came to me in person face to face and said the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and guess what i didn't say no so it is my spiritual body and this is why it's wonderful i know for sure jesse duplantis go check him out jesse duplantis he lives in new orleans or right outside new orleans louisiana he literally was caught up in his physical body and taken to heaven if you if that happens to you you will know now i know that you know paul didn't know but a lot of people at that time probably hadn't been caught up to heaven if you're caught up in your physical body your physical body is not accustomed to the glory the power and the life of god that is in heaven and eventually your physical body would get weak in heaven however your spiritual body that is is all spirit it's made out of light heaven itself is made out of light it's a building substance so everywhere you go in heaven in your spiritual body you can touch the ground you actually sit in your mansion i have guests in your mansion you travel all over heaven you know on light or sound you enjoy a literal life and that's the proper way to say it so every time i go to heaven i experience everything that is there but it is my spiritual body and when god is done he sends he brings my my spiritual body back zip right inside my body and then i'm aware of everything i have every memory of being there the smells the emotions the things i saw it's all retained because your spirit man has a mind okay your soul which is in your spirit man is what you express emotions from it's what you gather information with so your spirit man and your soul i was caught up to heaven i have both of those my physical body just sits and does nothing so there you go here's the answer all right next question is from bonnie and it says do people who accept christ on their death bed have big elaborate mansions do people on their deathbed have big elaborate mansions in heaven that's really um more than one question but i'll go ahead and answer that question the bible clearly says that god will reward us for our lives lived on the earth you're not going to escape being rewarded by god now what some people think of as a reward may not be the the powerful supernatural reward that we get in heaven and the thing that he loves the most is if you used the gift he put in you like whitney houston she used her gift she sang she used it all the time it blessed god she got she gave herself back to christ the night before she died and let me tell you what she had fantastic reward in heaven i didn't see her mansion but i was actually caught up to heaven and i saw her receiving rewards from the father at the throne this was right after she had passed and you know what this is the other thing whether you have a massive mansion because you really gave your entire life every hour of the day you helped people loved people you use the gift he put in you you ran your race holy on purpose they're going to have fantastic mansions because they gave more of their self now you cannot work for your salvation i have to say that that salvation is free and there is no one in heaven that is sad disappointed or upset so no matter what they ended up with to live in they were filled with joy with celebration with excitement because of what god had made for them but god is a just god and those who really served him loved him and loved others and was forgiving all the time and didn't live with the fence in them of course their mansion is going to be fantastic i have seen mansions in heaven that were the size of new york city i hope that stretches your mind on realizing how huge heaven is it's fantastic it is amazing there are sky mansions mansions under the crystal sea there's an amazon forest and amazing i just say amazon to give you an idea uh there's like massive trees that would be the size of 12 massive trees here they're like 500 feet high there's wonderful beautiful things there so there's there's like forest there's the mountain of spices there's passionate paradise that's about the love of christ and worshiping him so many places in heaven with many different mansions i've never seen a shack or just a little cabin if someone had a cabin it was on the property of their amazing mansion and family members do live right next door each other but when you come home to heaven you don't come as somebody's husband or wife you come home to heaven as the father son or daughter and he makes sure everybody gets a mansion so absolutely i've seen such amazing beautiful mansions and they were the mansions of little grandma intercessors that prayed in their closet and prayed in three or four moves of god forgave anyone who came against them just poured out their life all day for god and even though no one on the earth knew them god was quite aware of what they were doing for him and he rewarded them powerfully but everyone in heaven celebrates the fact that they're there so next question okay next question is okay and i'm only going to mention this because this is like a major topic with a lot of things and a lot of people have said if you don't do this specific thing you won't go to heaven oh this is a good one yes and if and i know what you're going to say so of course you do you're my sister and i've known you since you were a baby but i love sharing this too because it debunks so much stuff of why you get sent in we are myth busters today yes and it's important to do that so people know the truth it says the truth will make you free and we are definitely filled with truth and revelation from the father so we're going to do it right now this is from anna and she would like to know do you have to be water baptized in order to well she didn't say in order to go to heaven but oh okay but it's necessary to be water baptized okay but you can expound on that foreign if you don't get baptized you won't go to heaven if you don't tithe you better you know if you don't go to church yes there's many things um over time that has been developed in the mind of man and man and if you do not many times have revelation from god or the scriptures aren't open to you or let's just say you never read the bible you need to read the bible the true word of god okay and people go what translations do you read i'm just this is a free tip from catker i love the amplified bible i read that's on my desk i have the king james version because it has a lot of stuff that is truth in revelation that's not even put in other translations i i love the amplified i love the everyday bible that's an older bible i absolutely love my main reading bible is the scofield bible because of all of the comments the commentaries that are put in there the revelation that god gave that mr scofield that that really explain and expound with revelation on the word of god so i would definitely say the niv the king james the amplified the everyday bible i'm trying to think of some other versions of it some my my husband likes to read the one that's more like everyday language it might be well it's not the enemy if he was here would ask him but i'll find out let people know later because they're always asking me which ones are okay there are newer translations however that leave out some of the word of god some aren't even a complete bible i'm not talking about just the new testament it's great if you start with the new testament i also love the not just the historical part of the the old testament but the miraculous that happened hey people the parting of the red sea all of that is real when elijah was on mount carmel okay those powerful things that happened way back in those days are exciting to read when you see even god's hand move back then the new testament of course is about jesus christ what he did for us the acts of the apostles did you know that's what the book of acts was about is what they did operating in the word of god the power of god that jesus christ gave them when he raised up these apostles under him but there are some newer translations there's every kind of bible out there trust me even ones that are not good okay that you don't want to read and by the way this is for free also free tip do not read false religions words like their bibles like it's not wise to fill yourself with the quran it's not wise to read the book of mormon it is not wise at all to read the satanic bible none of these things are about false religions that do not believe in jesus christ his blood that he is the son of god or they leave out main events that are going to happen there will be a tribulation i've seen the timeline of god that's embedded in the floor behind his throne and these things are going to happen the millennial reign of christ which you could also say the thousand-year reign of jesus christ on this earth it will happen by the way that's quite a ways away from here i've been taking over 100 years into the future we're still here so that's also a free tip you're not going to be you're not going to be raptured out of here in the next few days or the next few years it's not going to happen in 10 20 30 40 50 60 i just could gone it's going to happen when the father decides what will happen but if you get a bible and it does not include major acts of god or events that god has already ordained will happen he needs these events to happen for his purposes don't read a bible that leaves major things out especially accountability especially where it talks about sin make sure that you repent of your sins there's all kinds of stuff going on and it's all kind of teachings literally in some churches they teach that you don't need jesus christ to go to heaven or that everyone's going to heaven no matter what they've done or the whole world's going to heaven i promise you the whole world's not going to heaven but you give yourself to jesus christ you find a word of god that is supposed to be like a plum line of decisions that you make sometimes it will help you learn how to pray how to develop an intimate relationship with jesus christ so i'm glad this question was asked so there are many different translations of what people call the bible and if they're not a whole word of god the whole new testament or the whole of you know the old testament or just both of them together that's not a truth that's not all the truth you find a word and you find the church that teaches the whole truth you can't leave the holy spirit out of your life he's the third member of the trinity he is god also so i can tell you right now the bibles i read have the whole council of god in them and i've talked so long i forgot what the original question was is it necessary to be water baptized and i didn't even answer that question and he just went out but that's okay i would have wheeled you back in when you were so worried you know why the word of god by the way it talks about being water baptized yes it's in the bible you give yourself to jesus christ repent of your sins okay because you're not going to heaven if you don't repent and i'll tell you why the father told me he's not letting evil wickedness and sin into heaven that's his home he said if i let everyone come to heaven without receiving my son heaven would be just like the earth and you don't want to live in eternity in the earth right you're going to live in heaven and i need to i need a break just a minute okay it is necessary to be water baptized because that is an outward representation that you gave yourself to jesus christ and when you do that it's like you died with him that's what it is when you get when he he he wipes away all of your sin and fills you with him okay water baptism is an outward expression that you received christ and your sins were wiped away so it's like you died and were resurrected with him in him and now he lives in you and that's what water baptism is that's why it is important to have it done however it's not going to keep you from going to heaven okay if you don't receive holy spirit of course that is such a power living in you he will become your best friend he is my best friend holy spirit is and and he tweaks me all the time he makes me laugh he shows me things to come he opens up the word of god how do you get him the same way you get christ you receive christ first and then you invite holy spirit to indwell you and let me tell you he's not going to say no so these are all a necessary process because when you get saved it's wonderful the salvation is free you have grace for eternal life your name is written in the lamb's book of life but it's important to do these other things because they increase your intimacy with christ they open up the knowledge and the understanding of god himself so water baptism is showing and let me tell you you don't have to do it in church a lot of churches have a baptismal they'll be glad to do that for you but i know people who've gotten baptized in horse troughs and swimming pools yeah one of my own dollars was baptized in the swimming pool at this private school that allowed everyone to come they had ceremonies and they did that they just baptized you in water and let me tell you the most important thing it says if you believe on jesus christ you shall be saved but being water baptized being filled with the holy spirit finding a good truth speaking church because it says to not forsake the gathering together of yourselves that means you can be part of a prayer group that means that someone who has a home church you can attend that some people watch church online and they give and tithe into that place wherever you are fed whatever feeds you in the word of god if there's somebody who does that whether it's a church a prayer group it could be a school of the spirit go where you can get more of god so it's not absolutely necessary because i will go back to the same thing that jesus said to the thief on the cross yay the thief on the cross the thief on the cross recognized that jesus christ was the son of god and he received him by the words he spoke to jesus himself remember me when you come into your kingdom remember me because he knew who he was but the other thief rejected him guess where that thief went okay this thief on the cross received jesus christ and christ answered him and said today you shall be with me in paradise now at that time when people who were accounted just and righteous because they they recognized god and received him then god kept them in a place in the earth called paradise it was down here it was a spiritual place a beautiful place so when abraham isaac jacob when all those great men women you know esther ruth when they passed they descended into paradise or abraham's bosom and it was not hell it was not hell that was for the wicked dead so i can tell you that because the thief on the cross he went and when and later on in that day this is when they're hanging on the cross this happened all right uh when they when the thieves died when they both died the one who rejected christ went into hell the other thief was in paradise when abraham's bosom which you know according to the word when christ's spirit man left the cross he descended into paradise or abraham's bosom he preached the gospel to all of them because according to them they their messiah had not come yet so you're getting a lot of scripture right now it's important to know this though so abraham isaac david all those righteous men um that would also be joseph you know the one who raised jesus these people before christ died on the cross ascended after he wiped up hell according to colossians he wiped up hell on the third day he spoiled and ruined prince valors and powers melted them okay and he took the keys of hell death and the grave from lucifer and then at that point christ rose up got his body back his physical body back so if you want to know is your spirit man busy can it see and hear and touch and feel christ did all those things in his spirit man descended into abraham's bosom saw the thief welcomed him greeted him like he said he would and then preach the gospel to all those who were there they were held captive in that place because heaven had to be chris had to pearl his blood on the altar in heaven and everyone sins from that point when they repented and you got forgiveness when you died from that point you just you ascended into heaven and abraham's bosom was cleaned out he led captivity captive and they all went up to heaven with christ so that changed everything that's why it was necessary so christ to do that so does that because this is another kind of you you answered someone's question i was going to ask okay but they just asked a further question um about paradise yeah so is it uh is it temporary or is it no longer existing paradise was like i said it was another word and it was called both places in the bible called it said abraham is more paradise it was the place where the those who were counted just and righteous by god because they believed in him and this is before christ came to the earth and died for us it was a place that was created so they had a place to stay and live there was buildings there was a river i've seen that place a beautiful place that god kept his that he counted as just and righteous it was emptied out when christ went there when his spiritual body left the cross and he went into abraham's bosom met actually he met in person abraham isaac jacob king david solomon adam was there the only ones not there were elijah and nina they actually were taken to heaven itself by by god the father he caught them up and took them in their physical bodies so they they were the only ones up in heaven besides all of the angels the living creatures um god you know the father or son holy spirit they all lived in heaven but after that happened it says in the word that people no longer descended they ascended christ descended for us and he cleaned that place out by preaching the gospel to them not hell okay he didn't go there to preach the gospel and then after he preached the gospel then he went over to hell christ did and then he was there and it says in the bible for three days he was there and then of course we know what happened on the third day and then christ after he was done wiping up hell taking the keys he went back up to the tomb got his physical body it was glorified instantly which is what we will experience on the day that dead and christ will rise our spirit men our spirit bodies have been living in heaven that's us will be rejoined with our physical body it will be glorified that means you can never sin never fall never die never get sick that you will be immortal it says mortality will take on immortality that's us we're mortals now we may be supernatural morals but to come a time in your life because of your receiving of jesus christ that you will be immortal and that's scriptural so there you go so it's empty abraham's bosom paradise is empty now there's no one yeah because when you die whoever owns you oh comes and gets you comes together and that's the best way the father said to me the first time i've got to heaven when you die whoever owns you will come for you so make sure you are praying for all of your loved ones who don't know christ because god gives us promises in the word and it says because we are believers who have received christ and bleed christ that there are things we can ask him if we don't doubt in our heart but believe what we say will come to pass then we will have whatsoever we say and the greatest thing you can do with that scripture is stand and say i stand for the salvation of my family members for all those who don't know christ i declare they will know him love and receive him and that we will be together for eternity that is a powerful declaration but once you've prayed that for them don't talk about how bad they are okay you don't want to do that that's like being double-minded if you're declaring they're going to know christ pray for them love them you may not be able to validate what they're doing don't validate their sin okay every time you see them love them and just tell them god loves them keep praying for them but it's a powerful prayer for a believer to stand for their family members because it says you and your household shall be saved and so that's because you know christ but uh so that answers that question very good um let's take a quick break oh yeah we want to uh tell everybody what we're going to show them yes we're going to take a little break and let you know we have some new things that we are going to we've been doing actually and one of them is called cat on the go and you become a part of my life where i'm going what i'm doing and we stop and make a little mini video and share that little piece of life so we're going to take a moment and let you see one right now hi everybody this is pat on the go and here i am say hi welcome hey everybody yeah we're very busy so we won't be talking to you very long but we're here discussing illustrations of the things that will become images in the resurrection movie is that right right it's exciting isn't it to be a part of it but it is a lot of work trust me it takes hours to do this you know we have to make sketches and he takes it makes it look amazingly beautiful okay i don't do that part he does and then we come back and there's edits and then he has to change things and i change things and he changes things but it's going to be amazing when it's all done and we can't we cannot we cannot wait to you know take that throne that throne that satan's been sitting on hollywood he's going down people going down god is taking it and we are doing this back again i hope you enjoyed that and so we did these cat on the gos different at different times on different days but you will enjoy every one of them so what is the next question um well this one's a bit of a tough subject and i the question flew by really fast so i didn't catch who asked it but um someone uh i think it was their nephew or something has recently committed suicide and they feel they're in heaven and um i didn't get to like i said i didn't get to read all of the question but what is god's say about that yes what does god say about when someone commits suicide so that is a very interesting question for me exciting but now you go that's just weird this is exciting not when god has caught you up on purpose to give you revelation yes and i have revelation on suicide i never knew my whole life now there were really strong christians i knew growing up and then later in life and they were going through a horrific struggles and they they ended their life and i inside knew that they were in heaven some of them i saw later in heaven and so the father on purpose said i'm going to show you the truth about suicide and he said first before i catch you up you're going to go to webster's dictionary and look up what it says about suicide and i was quite surprised because we all know people who do that what they call suicide what is called suicide people are either under horrific stress or trauma and it can be physical emotional or mental there's three areas in life where the enemy will just bombard you and crush you until you no longer can stand it and then people in their life take their life and everyone tags it suicide but god doesn't do that god is just and righteous so when i looked up the word suicide in the webster's dictionary it said someone who commits suicide is in their right mind with all of their senses they are knowledge of their mind their will and their emotions they know exactly what they're doing they're not in trauma or stress and they take their life and god said to me that would be like a terrorist or a suicide bomber there are people who plan on purpose in their right mind to on purpose die and most of the time our last time that is to hurt other people yeah like let's say um 9 11. okay all those people who are involved with the the death of all those people when those planes hit the buildings they knew their life would be taken that was suicide these people willingly knowingly got on those planes to on purpose go kill people and end many people's lives and that is called suicide what people this is the father speaking to me what people are experiencing they're not ending their life they can't bear the pain they're in whether it's mental emotional or physical sometimes people are in accidents the pain has agony the medicines sometimes the medicines even will give you thoughts of suicide and some people just can't no longer handle the suffering and god said they don't want to take their life or end their life they're ending their suffering and he said to me i would be unjust especially if this person had received my son and they couldn't handle the suffering they were ending the suffering he said i do not send those people to hell and i do not call that suicide and so therefore that is a very important answer and the first time i released that people were in shock but it makes sense because if somebody knew christ but then some tragedy happened to them whether physical mental or emotional that wasn't even their fault and they couldn't bear the suffering so they all they want to do is go home to heaven this does not give you excuse because you're going through a hard time to to take your life to go to heaven that's not right but people who are in agony on strong medications going through trauma's therapy you know when they get to the point where they cannot handle living they end their suffering and after he taught me that he took me to heaven and showed me three different people and i think it's even in one of my books where he talks about this whole thing about ending your suffering or taking your life there's a difference so you know a terrorist suicide person someone like that that is suicide but someone who's ending their suffering because of the trauma even some children do it teenagers older people people every age suffer but this is the good news if at any time when they were still in the right mind if you can get them to choose to lose i was just going to say i will tell you god was so adamant about this that he told me i'm going to put despair on you for a week and you will not be able to bear it and people go why would he do that so i would totally understand what people are feeling when they get to that point and he said right before suicide there is despair despair when you get into despair there's no hope no way out it's absolute agony in your mind to even exist and he said i'm going to put i'll let you experience it and he he literally put despair on me and for a week i would go climb in my car this was years and years ago he did this and i would all i would do is cry out to him i couldn't bear it i let me tell you i couldn't think right my emotions were a mess physically i had no energy i couldn't even think of a way out but i knew in my mind this was something god was letting me experience i think it's the only way i actually survived it at the end of the seven days he just came and took it off and joy and celebration flooded myself he said i don't want you to ever forget that is what people experience when they go through oppression depression deep depression then there is a spirit of depression on people and then there's despair after despair gets in then that's when the suicidal thoughts start coming people need to not keep that in them that's why he tells me god says don't even let sadness be in you do not let sadness rule your life most of the time you don't even know why you're sad you need to say i choose as an act of my will to lose all sadness all oppression all depression [Music] all despair and for some people you need to say this i lose every suicidal thought from me i will not keep it in my soul and then you say and i choose with my will to bind the life of god the love of god the presence of god his joy his celebration those i bind to my soul and no one can take them from you i hope this really helps somebody today but it does give hope for all those if your family member was in agony in the end of their suffering i promise you and especially if you made a stand for them to know christ they will be in heaven this is the hope we have and a promise we have from jesus christ and people tell me sometimes you don't talk about jesus he is my everything he is my number one my husband is my number two and that's not ever going to be changed don't run out in the spirit and become so supernatural to signs and wonders and forget who gave you the right to do that we can't go through this life and be successful and happy if you do not make jesus christ your number one before you start looking for someone else to fill a void in your life make sure jesus is there first so i think we're probably going to have to end this i might take one more question quick one one more question and then we have to go on to something else this is from i hope i'm saying this right it's um karina and she would like to know if you have any insight on tattoos this is another good one i love these ones i have revelation on because you know um earthwise time i've been around for a while may not look like it and i think like a child because the more i know god the more i act like one and think like one but for years i was told that tattoos were a sin a crime against god a blaspheme in leviticus it talks about them it says you shall not mark yourself and so people let me give you the revelation god gave me that scripture was talking about the culture of that day this is in the old testament in leviticus in the old testament it said you shall not mark yourself with the marks of the dead now in some of the new translations they may have changed that scripture or say you will not have tattoos on you but that's wrong because that's not the great translation god does mark people himself as invisible was a tattoo it is a visible permanent mark he marked cain in the bible remember that when he had even killed label but so people would not kill cain god put a mark on him letting people know do not kill him that was a permanent visible mark in the bible it says some people will mark me mark me put my marks on them and so there are people who have a permanent visible mark on them we in this time and age we call that tattooing and let me tell you even in heaven when you get there it says god will put his mark in your forehead the name of the city of your god will be put a permanent visible mark in your forehead and it will be put in the palm of your hand this is in the word of god people so heaven puts permanent marks on you it also says in the bible that god will mark 144 000 jews that will do powerful things for him in the last day so what are you going to say to those people you can't go to heaven because you have those marks on you there will be people that will put marks on their self because god has even asked them they will not represent hell okay these marks cannot represent hell because what you put on you says who you serve yeah and so that part is very important as signs of things that represent death or hell should not be put on your body and if you had that done a long time ago i would encourage you to go back and have them changed i do know that it's possible i do know this in this great move of god coming where the fire of god will be loosed over people he will actually erase a lot of the other kind of tattoos off of you but you cannot put that as something you can't just put in a box because that scripture in leviticus says in the culture of that day they were marking themselves with satanic marks all kinds of people back in the way back in the day in the old testament they were cutting themselves and cutting off parts of their body and giving them to idols worshiping idols okay it also says you should not cut yourself uh you should not worship a false god all this was the culture that was taken place back in the old testament in this in the leviticus in those days so but it does say you should not mark yourself with the marks of the dead i will also add this if you're young and you are still living under the covering of your parents don't run out and get one just because i said that to you when you are on your own if you want to have something that represents heaven revelation that is going to be your own decision when you're out on your own but don't do something that's going to call cause grief in your family or strife in your family okay make sure that that is going to be okay with with god and if you're under your parents you honor your father and your mother and let me tell you i always did that and if god ever tells me to get one i'm going to wear it i keep saying i may get it i'll make it if you got better on my face it'd probably be would we a wing of the living creature with eyes in it or something but right now i'm not planning that but i need to give you truth and that is true that marking yourself in today's world they would call that a tattoo it doesn't it's not all jesus has wrong jesus himself has on his entire thigh has written a permanent visible mark that says he is the king of kings those are spiritual kings and the lord of lords so our own lord and savior has that mark on him and god has used it in the past and present okay to let people know they live for me they represent me so go you be powerful re please run after jesus christ first get revelation ask for revelation yourself and we're going to end our session right now so that i can go and do something our q a session and go into something else and i hope you have a blessed day and i release the life of god in part the life of god the joy of the lord in jesus name and so we're going to go on to our next session yeah we're just going to switch we're going to switch topics right now and we're going to talk about the guardian zone yay we love our guardian and we love this because this is a plan that god gave us again the things that we do no matter what those things are if god creates an event through us or a move of god he's starting he has us make a mark or a logo for it because he's marking it as his it will cause a move of god with whatever that purpose is and we love it when he does that and for years because my book was actually written in 2005 2006 my first book and he gave me a deadline to have it published by may of 2007 and it was i actually met that deadline and it wasn't easy because i still lived with all of with my family my my mom my mom my sisters a couple of my sisters lived with us my niece my daughters my husband and i we all have one big home together and i had to write that book in the midst of that so all you people that god have asked you to write you don't have an excuse you find time you do it he wants that he needs that message given to people whether it's just to make people laugh to give them a revelation on how to do any ideas and inventions let's say it's uh it's powerful revelation on the word itself uh maybe a prophetic book about things to come you have to step out and start that book and i had to write it we're living with all of that stuff going on in my own home it was never quiet i never had any really quiet time and it's a good thing i do stay up and my my greatest creative time is from midnight to 4 a.m is when i in those hours that's when i wrote all my books just when i do all my sketches most all of them are done during that time and so sometimes you just have to find a way to do it by the way at our our events we have different events and heavens invitation this is going to be for free right now heaven's invitation is coming up in june and we will have a pr a free author how to become a published author or self-published author workshop and when you can get something for free that is a good thing and there are different methods that you can use to write and you stick to that protocol but let me tell you only 10 of all books that are started ever get published and it is possible to get published so i want to encourage you in that moment but i'm going to talk about the guardian zone and the holy spirit and the father dropped this in my spirit and we actually designed a logo several years ago which represented the guardian zone and and that image that you're going to see or you are seeing right now it represents two flows something is flowing in so it can flow out so as the support and supply comes in that's your giving then the revelation can go out and what people do when they join the guardian zone you're a member but we call you a guardian how about that god does love to give titles i know man talks about not having titles but god is really big on giving titles to people especially in these powerful days we're in now so you will become a guardian by your continual support in giving your financial giving and we actually have people right now on phones that you can call this very moment and they will answer the phone they take down your information and how you would like to give it it doesn't matter if it's weekly monthly you know it can be annually whatever but most people choose to give monthly or or weekly whatever god puts in your heart to give whatever is in there to give it it helps us to release more revelation like the studio it costs money okay it costs money and you'd be surprised probably if you've never done it what it costs to do things like this because we have really good cameras now we have professional lights we have an awesome media desk let me tell you what my one sister my one sister hello patty uh paid for this media desk knowing what would be used for she will get reward because of purchasing this for so we could have a professional looking desk to do all of our media and our broadcast we're going to be doing webinars really they are going to be coming up we're going to do webinars we're going to do all kinds of things from here we will actually have weather warriors weather broadcast we have a green screen that's uh we're setting all that up so we can do stuff with the green screen and there'll be a point where we do weather warriors and you literally will see on the green screen the weather the destructive weather or the threat of it you'll see it on the green screen and as we're declaring and decreeing over you may see things changed immediately or we will come back the next day and show you the actual thing that happened let's just say a big tropical storm is coming and it was building and growing it was really getting bad and we all take authority over that in our with our weather warriors group from all over the world now we have people in every country now that do this um and it's gonna be powerful and by the way i might as well just tell you we are planning a webinar for weather warrior training instead of making everybody come here to do that we're already working on setting all that up sometime in the spring i can't give you a date at this moment but we will have a webinar it will cost a small fee because we will need people to be here that aren't normally here we'll have all kinds of other stuff that we'll have to have and things going on it will not be very much but let me tell you it's cheaper than flying getting a hotel and having to sit and wait in between the events it will be powerful focused training on how to be a weather warrior and you will be so filled with it and trained with it no matter what comes up anywhere and if you see or hear something coming up in the world that is destructive you should take authority over it because you're over the weather not under it so there's my free clip that's just one of the things that some of our funds are used for and some of these funds that people are you're giving right now that's what the guardian zone is is helping to support heaven's plan to release heaven on earth and create products that represent heaven on earth and put them in the marketplace and you have to supply for me because i don't get a big check from a church somewhere you know i love church by the way i'm going to give a plug to church god is not abandoning the church he's going to settle set it free the ones who are teaching deception like it's okay to send all you want to you that's called deception uh pray for those people but don't stay there okay the church is the way god designed so that we could all have members to be together to fellowship together to break bread together and to help each other it's very important we have many revivals in the past it wouldn't have been possible if people in churches involved in church were not there and so i do know there's a lot of home churches as many new ways god is doing things we're in a new time in the spirit realm and in god's plan so i'm all for home churches churches and offices these are people who teach the word they they pray for people they have prayer groups intercessory groups schools of the spirit now schools of the supernatural it's just exploding everywhere so there's many ways to get to know god get more of god but these funds that you give us help to provide provide for me personally and to help take revelation places we never could do it before and it helps us to put new materials out there for people so i really appreciate every person and many people have responded to become a guardian and i'm just going to share a little bit the numbers are on the screen right now to call and like i said we actually have staff right now waiting to take down your information if you'd like to become a member of the guardian zone and you don't want to go online yourself to do it you can actually call and they can take all your information and they will sign you up in the guardian zone and then what you're going to get is i send revelation reports to you at different times throughout the year i have special gifts that are being designed as tokens of our appreciation that you will receive and every year you will get towards the end of the year you'll get a real beautiful collectible item from my heart to yours and you will have god's blessings on you because this is heaven's plan and so uh people have all kinds of questions sometimes about this god is not against people giving especially if it's his plan and it helps those who are pouring out their life to do what god is asking and if people around this world weren't willing to give their life to christ not just receive christ but spend their life giving the truth praying for people i know powerful men and women of god that are out there right now around the world helping people and giving to them if they're doing that is a god thing people complain about paying tithes or giving offerings or you know the bible is free the bible itself isn't free actually unless you go to a group like maybe the salvation army the gideons you probably can get a free bible but all these bibles are being the wonderful ones filled with truth have all kinds of helps in them and things that people spent a lot of their life doing translations in different languages for different purposes we probably eventually i don't know when we'll probably have a revelation bible filled with revelation on the word of god itself and the times and all those things right now he's got me on many different platforms doing things but i can tell you those who are doing it and then they put that in the bookstore to be sold you cannot walk in a bible bookstore and just take products out of there and walk away and say i'm taking these free it's like going to anyone who has their business and this is how they make their money and i want you to know that even jesus made money on this earth he had a business he was a carpenter he didn't give it away for free that was his living paul worked with fabrics and i know he did make tents but he also made banners and all kinds of beautiful things he made a living even while he was ministering and when christ was ministering i'm sure there was a point where he did stop doing that but it's okay to be in business and minister also at the same time and so you go to the store and you go to places all the time to spend your money you're getting what you paid for but here when we do things like this and every day we're putting stuff out there i i believe right now there's probably 500 hours on youtube of me talking about heaven on every kind of subject possible and that we do not charge for that we don't charge of course for facebook uh all the stuff we put out there when i go and speak you know when i go places i'm invited to speak sometimes they have to charge a fee because they have to run to place they have to pay security they have to pay the ushers they have to pay people to come and be a part of that and so i can hear the phones ringing right now that makes me very happy but even ourselves in our own events that we hold every single year we will not ever charge people to attend those events that means that we are taking on all the expense and i'm just going to give you a tip because some people never know if somebody goes and they're going to hold a big event like in a hotel unless it's a three-day event and it's a major hotel they could be paying 20 000 to rent the space in that hotel because this is the hotel's property you also bring most of the time your own equipment like your speakers your microphone your technical technical stuff you have to carry and take it into these places people are really blessed if they find a church that might let them rent the church to have a meeting and so that's probably a little bit less expensive but i know we ourselves in the past we would pay like twelve hundred dollars a day to be at the marriott those meetings we held there they weren't free for us but we didn't charge anyone that's something god ask of me personally so our main events which would be heaven's invitation that's heaven inviting you to get revelation that's always in june okay then we have the dread champions that is the manifested sons of god that is for men and older teens teenagers boys uh that is just for them and they have powerful events with the men and then we have the wonder women that is our all women event and i can tell you what we shake hell we shake hell we send the armies of heaven all over the world we had people women from 40 almost 40 different places i'm talking about countries that come to these events it's always going to be usually the first weekend in november and so uh we are already putting stuff out there to save the save the date for these meetings that are coming up we're already making major plans for them and of course weather warriors will also be an annual event and uh like i said we're we are right now creating a webinar where we can do that and people from all over the world will be able to join on that webinar we will get the dates to you as soon as we have it all set up like i said there'll be a small fee you you'll pay that to join us you'll be given a special link to go to so that you can watch it and only the people who up who will sign up for that event for that webinar they will be able to see it and be trained powerfully it will be over the course of two days that we will have that this is something new for us but we will begin if i mentor my mentoring in the future will only be done the webinar so it's going to be very powerful that we have this source of media to use so i'm just giving you some tips on what do we do with that money okay i am not just by myself i'm not sitting here alone by myself i have staff all around me i have staff in the other rooms of our office right now one day we will have a huge place because god has already shown me that and i do know what will happen and eventually we will have staff and facilities around this world but this is where we are starting okay uh my my family you know we still live here because right now this is where god has us so it's like we're in our office 24 hours a day that's what it feels like sometimes and so it powerfully helps us you know god blesses us and the word talks about giving offerings and sharing i don't usually go into that part of it it's what is in your heart if you receive revelation if it has changed your life we will eventually one day actually have a program that does nothing but share testimonies from around this world of how revelation has changed their life it's the more of god it comes from his self it's from his throne and we love sharing that a lot of my staff learn to adapt to heaven culture that's what we call it and we explain in many of my messages out there you learn how to live heaven culture you learn how to take authority you learn how to work with the army of heaven you are trained because it is our job the bible says that the fifo ministry is here to train you we're not supposed to just share a few good words and sing a couple nice songs you need to lead changed okay we go from glory to glory by getting more of god and then applying it if you receive if you go to church you get a powerful message and they give things to inspire you and to help you that means you apply it to your life and so i tell people i'm not here just to talk to you i'm here to help change you and trust me until you are walking in the spirit okay that means your flesh has died to itself when you walk in the spirit it blesses the heart of god but your life begins to be it's like you breathe him in and you breathe him out walking in the spirit brings life okay it even says that in the word of god walking in the spirit is not partnering with hell not tolerating hell in your life all that stuff is true in the bible there is a hell i have been there and seen it there certainly is a literal heaven i've been there and seen it many times and god has powerful things for us right now in this slide so make sure you call the number on there and you join the guardian zone i will so appreciate it you can go online we do have a website you can go to if you're if you're if you're technology based you certainly can go to catker.com and you click on the treasury and then you choose the guardian zone this is the way you yourself you can go on there and fill out all the information choose when you want to give how much you want to give and then that will be done for you so there is an online way to do it and believe it or not people who do nothing but live in technology don't understand there are actually many many people still in this world that don't even own a computer that wouldn't know how to operate a computer some of them actually don't have cell phones is that wild so not everyone is buddies carrying around their tablet or their ipad totally connected to the world that way there's still old school people around and there probably always will be i know technology is changing everything and we have to move with all of that but but this is a way that you can give the guardian zone is helping to support heaven's plan and i appreciate it so much that you choose to join um we had a couple people ask if they want to send it by mail okay where so i posted the p.o box address okay but can you explain to them i will explain i need to make the chat yeah so we're going to talk just a minute about how you give like i was just saying that everybody can go online and give that way you can send your amount through the mail you can send to stuff to us i think they have right now got the po box we have a p.o box you can send stuff to you if you want to send your weekly or monthly or whatever it is where you choose to give you can send it to that special p.o box please write on the envelope now you can put my name because and let me tell you this the checks have to be made up to me personally we have a business also so the business cannot receive donations okay they can't and i am not a 501c3 this is some more news for you i cannot give you a tax deductible receipt but in the bible of course it does talk about giving it gives gives offering you give offerings you give to help the poor you can give ties i am definitely all for tithing god didn't do away with tithing either and like i said that is given to whoever it is that feeds you with the word of god in the holy spirit but you can send through the mail a check a money order make sure you make it out to cat curve and in the four section at the bottom make sure you write guardian zone gift it is a gift and like i said you'll become a member of the garden zone on the outside envelope it really helps us if you put it on there so we don't have to try to call you and say is this a guardian's own gift so right guardian zone if you don't want to write all that out write g capital g capital z gift where it says 4 on your check or your money order please write that in there but if you can remember somewhere on your envelope you can also write the guardian zone so we know automatically when it comes to the mail because yes you can do that we have a database that we have specifically created we will not share the information that you give us and so

and i was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it looked like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause their soul to prosper all the time and then they'll live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering here so cat um well those of you who don't know the lord's been taking her to heaven for several years and showing her things and bringing her back and allowing her to share with us so let's just welcome cat kerr [Applause] your soul is one of the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well i'm this and that no adam became a living say it loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to god that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life is probably one of the least talked about things in the church is a soul growing up i always heard that it was bad went but god made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul how why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with god and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your soul is fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody can wound and hurt you and it stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand i was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time i never usually know but i looked at my clock and i was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it looked like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause their soul to prosper all the time and then they'll live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that word be means live it's called divine health so i since i learned about this the father taught me about that he said people can lose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you lose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can lose from your soul and he said i know most people bind the devil with the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talk about the loosing thing what are you going to do with the leucine key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of god to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about god will never be taken from you and so people i know you know you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it i'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to lose that that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out say what's loose on earth is loose in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of god as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're going to do a soul checkup i hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming i hope you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're going to do some spiritual warfare with the host they'll be excited you may leave with an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're going to have some fire sent the angels already outside waiting but they're going to do that tomorrow night i did this recently where i mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time to start getting i want to say drops of it the fire of god is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our god is a consuming fire i'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of christ send the fire i want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart i mean literally makes your your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with god the fire it burns it out and then he puts himself in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from god too stones of fire i find in one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that satan left on some other planet was in the bible and i already knew what they were so god made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is i'm like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to lucifer okay they were inside god or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the river of life that's in him the river flows out of him the gems

good morning everybody [Music] this is almost my morning [Laughter] how many people don't know me or know anything about me anybody got dragged here [Laughter] i'm so glad you're here i prayed for you a long time ago that people would understand heaven is different they live differently there uh hair color is heaven culture i didn't ask for this i am not a paint care person well i am now but years ago when the lord came to me in person because even as a child i would say if jesus ever comes to me in person and asks me to do something there's no way i'm not saying yes this is like an eight-year-old okay so i was strange even back then i've been a seer my whole life i was born with that gift that does not belong to the enemy most people when you mentor mention the seer or the spirit realm they think you're part of the new age movement no it was around long before the new age movement was here okay it belongs to god it's sent from heaven he needs seers on this earth and he needs prophets that are seers more than anything else because we say what we see whatever he takes us and shows us the difference between a prophet and the seed of prophet is we actually get to see what he's saying not just hear him say it therefore we give details and i can assure you what i say to you today will be things he told me or showed me or both and maybe things you never heard of before or even thought of before but i speak on behalf of heaven on this earth that is my commission it's not my gift my gift my passion is photography so you see before you a photographer minding her own business which is now god's business remember when jesus said i must be about the father's business remember when he said that i understand what he meant when he said that okay because he had the life of a carpenter correct say amen he was sent is a carpenter corrupt right he was then as a businessman and he knew who he was long before he got to that place of being a businessman god loves business people because they have openings that a lot of people who are in you know if they're christian leaders or in any way associated with a christian i don't like to say religious because god's not religious he wants a relationship with you and even that is sometimes new to people that never heard that man man created religion christ created a relationship he died for every single person right on the planet he didn't die just for a denomination and saying that i was part of the assemblies of god almost all of my entire life and grew up in that atmosphere which was awesome we had holy spirit we had the gifts working we had miracles we sent missionaries all over the world i helped to serve at our family church not my dad's church but it was our family's church i'm from a family of 15 children i'm number three that means i died a long time ago i also can read your thoughts just a tip i belong to jesus christ since i was four years old that was well over 60 years ago i forget how old i am because i don't look at age god counts time by events and so he chose me for a certain time on this earth to do things and say things for him i never asked to be caught up to heaven he decided that i was going to be a photographer i was going to work in business i loved working with ceos for over 25 years i was working in business he took me out of that at one point in my life and he said i'm gonna prepare you for what is coming and the next season of your life he didn't say it would be to be caught up to having non-stop to give revelation on what heaven is like i would have done it anyway because by that time i was besotted with him i sought him earnestly on purpose fiercely for over 20 years now remember i was born again at four this is when i'm into my 20s by this point in my life and in my 30s i really passionately and i raised three children i'm married there's my husband of 43 years sitting right there y'all pray for him okay he has to live with me i'm not normal [Laughter] you can't be normal when you've been to heaven as many times as i have been there this is not really reality to me standing here this is a vapor in time your life right now is a vapor in time your future is going to be so powerful and great and grand and i'm not just talking about when you get to heaven i'm talking about because of the time you live in right now one of the most amazing fascinating powerful times to be alive on the earth is actually right now and anytime god before he did something great the enemy showed up to try to steal that time the enemy wants his time his time is not yet and the father would tell me all the time he's only given satan a bump in the road that's what he calls the tribulation in the paris times and there's people now even saying they're not going to have that they're wrong i've seen god's timeline part of it and he is going to have those things happen for his own purposes he needs them to happen in the earth they'll be for a short time but the times we're entering into now will be for generations maybe you didn't think that again i've seen 50 to 100 years into the future and the mere perilous times had not happened the tribulation had not happened and i think it would be better if we stop saying he's going to come tomorrow i will say he's going to come when the father tells him to is the correct thing to say christ is coming back i absolutely believe in the rapture i absolutely believe that those times will happen but those aren't these times we haven't even done the works alone the greater works christ passionately said certain things would happen and some of them haven't even happened he's not willing to wrap it up and end it in the midst of darkness amen things are getting greater and greater and more and more powerful in these days we literally will learn to rule like christ did in the earth the bible clearly says don't tell me what the word says i know what it says people better know what it says it says we will rule and reign with christ now say now and in the time to come we will that's who we are we have authority as believers if you're not a member of the body of christ you have no authority you have no authority over satan you have no authority in the spirit realm you have no authority to speak for god if you're not belong to jesus christ and you have not had your sins washed away you are not righteous i hope you say amen god does not agree with it's okay to sin all the time whenever you feel like it that's right god does not agree with once you get saved and if you if you sin and keep on sinning the grace will cover it that's only if you repent that's what the word says is that correct christ is righteous and just if you repent of your sins he will cleanse you from all unrighteousness is that what that says that means when you sin say you're not saved when you sin something happens in your soul when i have you say it that's why i do that when you sin that makes you unrighteous when you repent he wipes it away and you are righteous i just as blunt as i can be i i love the truth i live by the truth i have to myself it doesn't matter that he catches me up to heaven all the time shows me mysteries takes me into the past takes me into the future i know what his heart is i know what his words are i know what his ways are i walk in them i know his will is not always what ours is the best way you can live is his will his way not his will your way he he desires so much for us to attain to everything that christ won for us this is one of those times where we're going to rise above our lives and all the way we've been living in the past that doesn't mean he won't desire holiness in our life that means we'll be doing things we never dreamed we would be doing and therefore when he's going to do something like that he has to clean the platform off a platform of man that platform of the enemy and crush the enemy and push him back so that we will have freedom to move around this earth not just in this country which by the way will be absolutely not just restored but almost reborn this is not the time for america to go down the tube and end we are this is what the father says you are a baby country you're still a baby you have begun to walk in all that i desire and i created you to do in this earth you are it will be a great light to this world a place where people can come to know my son a place where they can walk in the glory that is created by those who love me a place where people come to see the miraculous as a normal way of life amen a place will come to america not to find the american dream but define me a place where prosperity will happen because two-thirds of the gospel has been paid for by people from this country i am not going to ignore the cries or the prayers of my people they are precious to me they allow me to give me permission to move and operate on their behalf and even over those who would take steal and try to steal cheat and steal and take this country away if you're interested the father calls biden a villain you should say amen a villain in any movie is the worst people who promotes and carries out evil deeds and the father is well aware of everything that's going on behind the barbed wire and he's not going to tolerate it because of the importance of these days for god for his son for holy spirit in this earth and especially particularly a miracle because it helps others know and learn about jesus christ and let me tell you that is not going to stop happening they have carried the message of the gospel of the kingdom they will now begin to carry the knowledge and the power of the glory he is not going to give up his time for the glory to be seen and known in this world there's actually scriptures written about the glory of god the number one is christ in you is the hope of glory do you know what that means that means you will begin to create glory for god and you will carry that glory amen literally the light of god will come from you that scripture also means that you will release that glory and operate in that glory how do you think the knowledge of it is going to go around this world we will demonstrate it things beyond your imagination are the days we're stepping into because of that god won't even send new creations and inventions to this earth because he's not willing for the wicked you have them say amen he's well aware of everything that's going on he's not oblivious to it it's not that he doesn't care he does care he just has a plan amen and it may not line up with man's dates that they keep trying to give that he's going to do something they were all wrong or he would have done it he won't even give me a date he'll say i'm going to do this and i'll say god's going to do this it doesn't bother me that it doesn't happen for a year or several months or even weeks i've waited 45 years before for him to do something he promised me and i never gave up and he did it amen my family understands faith we lived by faith god was welcome in our home so his holy spirit so was jesus christ he was our healer you got 15 kids you need jesus as your healer from being shot point blank with a shotgun to being bit by deadly spiders from being hunted by people kidnapped and then brought back we stood in faithful albums and every one of them we had victory why can i not stand for a few months to see god act in my country and in my nation this is not just about america this is about the whole world right now he is exposing evil all over the world in great detail and most people will be shocked and i promise you you will know what was going on you actually see the evidence hear the hear hear the testimonies see the videos of the horrific things that have been already got they already have the evidence right now this moment i'm standing here they have the evidence and i will promise you this trump is our president if you don't want that you need to lose something out of your soul because you're fighting against god not trump god picked somebody who couldn't be bought who couldn't be forced who couldn't have fear put in them who could not be controlled he picked him on purpose and he picked a businessman he has already proven himself that he loves this country and he loves the people in this country and there's actually you should know by now persecution comes because the enemy doesn't like certain things the persecution is the proof that you're going to get what you ask for you have properties and lands and blessings in this life with what say persecution you should always rejoice when persecution comes that means you're doing exactly what god wants [Applause] it's really evidence i rejoice i compass and say man you should be rejoicing and dancing you've got all that persecution you're going to get something great from god and he never saw it that way i said that's how jesus seems he wasn't concerned at all about persecution he didn't care that the religious hierarchy didn't like him he was a threat to them he was also a character when he walked in this earth he was funny people loved to be with him even sinners i'm sure he captivated them in revelation they never expected to hear they heard words they never heard before and it made them burn inside people burn in heaven because of the revelation they live in in the parts of god they see you never got to see they get to see parts of the future they get to see parts of the new earth they saw how things were done by god way in the past before even the physical realm was created your family members are living in the greatest place possible they are happy they're rejoicing they're blessed beyond measure they have mansions no human hands can afford to build your mama and your dad your grandparents great grandparents don't want to come back not because they don't love you but they're one of the one who loves them the most you can have the understanding of that love it makes it a lot easier to live in this world when you see it through christ's eyes when he was on that cross dying for all of us and he understood that people didn't understand they didn't have a clue the ones who were even reviling against him at that point he died anyway didn't he what little is it to us to die to our flesh sometimes if we have a choice to be kind to someone even if they're being mean to us it's one of the greatest things you can do to pierce the enemy you pierce the heart of the enemy when you love instead of fighting back against people when you're kind even when you're spent is fought upon or mistreated or wrongfully accused when you choose to love doesn't mean you're just being foolish it means you're piercing the enemy your worship also pierces the enemy it goes right through the second heaven maybe you didn't know about that satan has built his own little tiny tiny kingdom up there he sits on a throne of skulls and he rules from up there because he's a prince in power in the air so he can do things in the spirit realm the spirit realm is both both sides are there all the time this is not heaven all right you're not living in heaven right now we're having more heaven sent down than ever before that heaven is not deserved and neither is hell heaven is beyond your imagination with the glory with the beauty the splendor the creativity the wonder of being there in his presence all the time with him you ride on your worship across the skies of heaven into the throne room you're transported through beams of light from one side of heaven to the other the food is everywhere there's no weight gain or food allergies on heaven everyone is young there is no age there is no time there's amazing fun exciting things to do because the father is a father it says you must be like a little child because when you get there you're going to be shocked to see how many fun things he made for you [Music] you may be 90 now but you feel like you're 9 when you get there there's laughter everywhere in heaven people love it it is love because he's there and he chose this time not us many people are in fear they shouldn't be if they belong to him he actually said i have not given you a spirit of fear but of power say power i want you to notice that's the number one thing he says has given us he gives us power that power he gives us as a believer is over all the power of the enemy that means no matter what's going on around us we have authority to speak against that you have authority to speak against anything the enemy is doing to you because jesus gave us that every demon should run in fear when you get up in the morning hell should tremble when you open your mouth and speak things to people amen because you have authority in your mouth you have the word of god you have the power of god you have the life of god you get revelation you have you have his plans his will for your life he chose you and put you on the earth that's why you're here right now no matter who you were birthed out of you were birthed from him first and he went down his timeline and chose when you would be here because he needs you here so these days are going to be different than anything we've ever lived before i've already seen these days i've seen well into the next 50 years that should be normal so i have no fear of anything he holds my life in his hand and the father holds the breath of every being on this earth and there are some so wicked he said all i have to do is remove it and they're out there are some very wicked people in this world right now they may not live through this yes god has done that before in the past he wiped everybody off the earth it was so wicked as bad as it is right now it is not as bad as it was to the tase of noah i know people think it is but it's not it's i'm not i talk about those horrific things that they did back then but there are people wicked enough to want that to happen and the thing is when the enemy finds enough and he's actually found a lot of humans who are willing to do things his way but the enemy's already lost because this is not his time even when it is his time he's not going to get what he wants because even those who are believers at the time of the tribulation and the parasites will be some of the strongest believers ever walked on this earth they won't even be afraid to die i know i've seen the movies from the time i was young i've seen the movies about you know during those days how bad it will be uh nobody will be forced to take the mark the mark is not the michael chip you can't see it that mark satan's going to put on people will be seen three blocks away because he's full of himself and he wants people to know who gave themselves to him so that won't be something that is forced on anybody he wants people to willingly do that and right now he's found a lot of willing people but it's still not the time for him to have authority in this earth therefore god is going to take and wipe the platform clean not just in america but he will remove evil from many different places and high authority and leadership in many different countries around this world i know everybody said well we're going to have the harvest it still won't be the final harvest the first waves of harvest we get those people need to be mentored to walk in the supernatural and learn how to roll with jesus christ so we don't know how to do that how are we going to mentor them we can't be normal we cannot be normal you can't live your life every day like it's the same you live your life with passion and excitement that we've been given great authority actually he gave us the earth amen we are stewards of this earth we're stewards of what goes on around here and god said i will allow what you allow i will not allow what you don't allow that's also in the bible so why are we allowing things everything you say from your mouth is written down you should go back and read the scripts i started counting my words a long time ago because i see scribe angels writing things down about ten years ago i woke up and there were two things sitting on the end of my bed and then one scribe angel looked at me said we have been sent for the words of all the leaders in the body of christ at this point now we will write down everything they say whether in public or in private and from those words are speaking god will decide who will have a leadership in these great end days and who will not have leadership those who will operate in power and authority those who will not allow to operate in power and authority if there's sin in their lives they will not be allowed to operate not in these greater days of glory he said people can fake many things they can fake being in the five-fold ministry they can fake by things they say and yet they're sinning behind the scenes but god sees everything that's right he's not watching you to hit you over the head with something he's watching you to see what is in your heart what do you desire to do for others that thing to esteem others more highly than yourself goes a long way in heaven i was raised that way my dad was raised that way i'm from seven generations of believers who actually believed i was the one who didn't want to be known or seen by anybody i was not someone who would put pink in my hair was the quiet one watch out for the quiet ones they're thinking and they're watching all the time i can just tell you god had a plan for my life i had a little plan i was going to get me a nice apartment and be in some big company because i loved working in business i'd like to see things happen and god had another plan no i'm going to give you pink hair i'm going to take you up to have a non-stop and you're going to go all over the world and speak to everybody you're going to hug them and let them kiss you on the cheek if they want to i was not a person that wanted to be hugged or kissed by anybody and yet i mean been kissed thousands of times by people around the world you know greet each other with a brotherly kiss that kind of a kiss so he's changed me he's changed the way i think the way i look at people i look at him through his eyes he loves you more than you ever ever can imagine no matter who you are even what you've done even with your failures with your mistakes things that you gave up on he has not given up on you and he has not given up on this country amen he has repeatedly told me america is not evil it isn't america itself is not it's one nation under god and he says that to me all the time it's my country it's mine and he said in 2015 i put my hand on the country and i turned that map red and he had already declared that trump would be president for eight years knowing every single thing that would happen and god says oh no he means right now not talking about in 2024 he's talking about right now he said to me trump won the election he didn't lose that makes him president the other side lied and cheated that disqualifies them he said if in the olympics they are caught cheating they are not congratulated they are not honored they're not rewarded they are removed and they have absolute all the proof they need that that happened just because the civil courts wouldn't hear the cases doesn't mean justice is not coming and i can promise you trump knows all of this he's not been lazy he's been very busy behind the scenes so are many other smart smart and intel smart people around the world that know what is right and what is not right and they don't need any more evidence than they have to take all of them to prison or be shot for treason these i'm speaking truth not making it up this is true trump is still our president he won the election uh on the election date and when they said we're going to stop the counting the holy spirit who is right beside me said that's really going to cheat and steal and change all the votes he said that to me right when they said those words we're going to stop the voting we'll pick it up tomorrow and then we'll see what happens well by that time almost 80 million people had already voted for trump yes and if you'll notice you never saw biden's people he never had rallies because he had no people but they didn't know what they were going to do they knew from the beginning they would cheat they already had their plans laid out that all those the voting machines and the dominion system already working on their behalf and i know most of you weren't aware of that but they switched so many votes overnight that before trump can switch them to biden and finally there's one county that is given permission to recount have 2.1 million of the ballots looked at individually all over again to make sure that they were counting but that's still not how he's going to be put back in office there's already things that have happened even in our military i will tell you this that the ones who are sitting there illegitimately god says are illegitimate in in dc he says the ones behind barbed wire that's how he talks about him [Music] are still hoping we will give up and let them do what they want to and this is what the father says there was a couple things they never considered when they plotted this whole thing together with the intel you know with the wicked rich with the fake news media i mean there's so many that are going to be probably be either put in prison lose what they have built up lose their fortunes because they will have been busted you're going to lose they'll lose all the way around there's no way they will ever win anything or have anything this is from the father himself he said number one they're trying to do this in a country that already is free they're not going to a third world country that isn't free they're trying to take things away from americans they're different they were born free they live free they make up their own mind they want a future he said there'll never be civil war that's what they were hoping for that we would be killing each other he said but americans true americans the red-blooded americans have a hope for a dream and a future they have a family they want a life and they want to live and they are not willing to give it up they didn't vote for evil they didn't choose evil he said an evil is not in power right now he will remind you of a scripture and the righteous are in power that people rejoice is that what it says well trump isn't power the other side is not they're illegitimate they stole the election he knows that almost 80 million people know that it was stolen because everybody knows who they voted for amen so this is an epic time in our country to show when truth prevails and the people prevail this country belongs to god and we the people amen the other thing they will never consider [Applause] and god says all the time i'm in your papers i'm on your money i'm written in your in your constitution you said i'm everywhere because i was allowed to be in this country he said when you look at the two differences between the illegitimate ones and the actual president i am welcome in this country by trump he even made that statement many times he recognizes who god is he invites god to be here he he loves christians he loves their faith he loves the the churches he loves and he wants us to have freedom and according to our constitution we have every right to have church to come together to meet is that correct so when the other side wants to wipe it out disallow it abolish it and crush it that should show you right there they're lost they have already lost what they want to plot and plan i'm not willing for that to happen amen and with all the prayers that have come forth on behalf of this country you need to know that when you pray they fill these bowls before the altar of god your prayers your worship fill these huge bowls and when they're full god tips them when they're tipped a whole new move of god comes to this earth so what is about to happen isn't crash and burn to be destroyed is about to be wiped clean of the evil and a powerful move of god is about to hit this country [Applause] and this is what the one who made everything is saying amen his words count above the others right amen but jesus christ wants is he not is not the earth his and the bones thereof the earth is who the lord and the fullness thereof then if it is his and he's already got this time planned who do you think is going to win jesus it doesn't matter how bad it looks or sounds and i would encourage everybody to stop watching the fake news because they plotted and planned to brainwash people all along they understand how that works and they have done that to many people i have family members i have friends that listen to it and all they know is this they hate trump they can't even tell you why they hate it they just know they hate him right and so they're brainwashed into thinking he's so bad they gotta vote for the other side they don't even know what the other side stands for i know i met somebody the other day before i came oh i like who's in there now i said you like evil you want terrorists to come into our country without any boundaries you want human trafficking and drugs to keep rushing into our country without anyone stopping them you want law and order taken away so people can come and burn your place or take whatever they want to from you and they're looking at me really strange well that's not what's going to happen i said they've already signed papers are you not listening to what they're saying oh no i just know they're good and trump is bad and that's what some people think they don't have a clue because they were taught for all those years continually when the same thing is put into you over and over again in your soul and you don't stop it or you don't lose it from there it builds in you as a man thinketh in his heart that's your soul so is he that means what you let in is what you will become your heart he talks about the bible all the time isn't this human beating heart it's the core the word heart means the core of something the center of something the core of your being is your soul you are a soul that's what god said when he made adam he became a living soul that is very key the other thing the body of christ needs to learn is what does that mean why is my soul so important why do you think he says to guard it you decide what goes in there you decide what you watch what you hear and what you say and all three of those things will affect who you are that's what will come out of you what you allow in there if you don't like you maybe you should change what you're saying or what you're watching because it will influence your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choose and your emotions how you respond to all that what do you act out in your life what do you actually say about you are you manifesting from christ his character his purposes his words clearly written because that's what he wants from us the world should look at us and see christ when they hear us they should hear christ is that right does christian mean christ's life then we need to start acting like that because when you do you terrify the devil if he can't crush you and put fear in you which has always been his greatest weapon his second greatest weapon is deception he's been working overtime with deception deceiving people taking up parts of the word making whole bibles that left hope books of the bible out or twist what they say i tell people make sure if you read the word of god it's got the whole counsel of god there's some that take out the the millennial reign of christ they even take out the tribulation some of them even say it's okay to sin and there's some people never heard any of this before but it's true because the enemy is doing whatever he can to deceive us amen and obviously some people have been deceived by believing a lie so i don't work for hell i don't represent hell i have nothing to do with hell there's no darkness in me i do not tolerate any acts or words or thoughts of the enemy yes yes i serve the most high god and him alone will i serve it's okay with me if people don't like my pink hair they will be taken to the welcome center when they get to heaven because you see people with every color of hair in heaven that's where the rainbow lives and the one who carried you you lived in that rainbow before you came here you had a little spirit of life that was your little spirit person lived in the father that's why we are his offspring you wrote on the rays of the rainbow in and out of him you played in the river of life inside of him you jumped on the stones of fire that burn with passion for you and online and that river of life goes over those those gemstones massive gemstone filled with a fire it shoots that rainbow out of him you lived there so he made a plan with the words on how to bring redemption how to bring mankind back to him in heaven some of the angels still call jesus christ the word you all know what the bible says the word was with god and was god and there was nothing that was made that was not made by him he had flesh put on him he agreed to come and die and that put on that cross and carry to that cross every sin wicked evil act word intentions he drank it in the cup in the garden even when he didn't want to did he give up his will did he say to the father not my will but your will be done and he drank all that evil he died in the garden when he surrendered himself because it wasn't just his body that had to hang on that cross every evil act and sin had to be put on that cross and someone who was perfect and holy had to carry that to the cross he was guiltless he was innocent no sin in his life even when he walked on this earth and yet he was willing to take that in him that is why he is the only one who can forgive your sins because he took those sins to the cross there's no other being that can do that for you there's no other religion out there that can say that you can get into heaven he is your way back to the father and part of his reward was when you die and moved to heaven you're not lost you didn't lose somebody they moved jesus christ is to walk you up the steps of the throne and say hear father i have brought your son or your daughter back to you that is why heaven rejoices and throws the biggest party ever every time someone comes home because jesus is going to get to do that that's part of his reward he loves to call you to get undone and when you step out of whatever you came in whether it's one of heaven's elevators whether it's a starship or it's christ's chariot there's many ways he can take you up to heaven when you get out you'll step into the river of life right there coming out of the city and he will start throwing water on you and you will have a water fight that's what you will have and you're going to see people dancing and singing all over even outside the gates they'll be celebrating there's music everywhere the flowers sing the trees seeing the ground is alive the sky is alive and you're stepping into life and some people like i thought we couldn't play music i thought it was going to be silent in heaven that was only one dime it was only one time it was silent in heaven that was it not since then you look for someone to be quiet you'll find a place and then the trees will start talking to you or the rocks or the creatures there's life everywhere so they have actually got a welcome center i'm not making it up you're going to laugh even harder when you see the humor of god this whole family i knew growing up in our city that owned all the funeral homes were strong believers they had compassion and kindness for people and one of the heads of all that was about ready to go home to heaven and god had me take this paper scroll paper and write in gold ink his word for that man that was ready for me to get a word for a person i usually prophesied corporately and i took it to the funeral home he was even in his 90s he was still there greeting people's families he had known for a long time and he's about to go inside and i said richard could i give you something and he said well what do you have i said i have a word from god for you and he started to cry on the sidewalk he said all my years of living and caring and loving no one has ever given me a word from god [Music] i said well he's gonna tell you your future in heaven gonna tell you what you're gonna be doing and god wrote all these beautiful words about him about he had been given a heart to care and great compassion and understanding to help people go through a time in their life and god said you always got them when they were going to heaven but now you will get them when they're coming to heaven because i'm putting you and all your family in charge of the welcome center and this is the hillary said you may tell everybody that you now your family now gets them going and coming and he was so undone and i said god would not let me just speak that word to you he has this scroll prepared as if he had handwritten himself it was this beautiful paper parchment paper i said this is your word and when you go home in a couple of weeks she said you'll be going in a couple of weeks you can let your brother know who's remaining what his future will be i said when he said that to me right yeah he took me up to heaven i saw your brothers they all look alike i saw your brothers i saw your father in this beautiful building and i saw people when they would get out of these transports and they're like this [Laughter] and they would walk in and say come on we're going to make it all okay yes you're in heaven i know it's more than you ever dreamed just come with us and we're going to explain and they had such compassion and kindness for the people and i love to tell that story because it shows you the humor of god but the reward of god he doesn't forget the kind acts that you do so i actually can say and you can say you know who's running the welcome center it is the heritage family from the hardest people and and i went to visit him once when he was in the hospice and i took him a picture of the portal in heaven i've been taken to where people look down and see their families and they can declare over them they go every year to sing happy birthday to you from from heaven and it's a beautiful place i was taken to they have them all over heaven and i i put that right beside where he was lying so he could look at it and he said i will never forget your act of kindness that you gave me god's word when i needed it the most and he said i am so looking forward to running the welcome center [Applause] and about a week after i went by there i was driving down the road and i knew where that where he was and that beat this beautiful hospice place and i actually saw him leaving with angels being taken up to heaven and god said look to the right and he said richard's leaving because i was obedient he allowed me to see him leaping and so i was very blessed so i started calling people richard richard heart just went to heaven before anyone else knew he went to heaven i just saw him he's leaving forever people are used to that for me and then they said then they had a head on the news because he was well known all the city uh we we we mourn the passing of richard harter to this day such that and i want thank you god for letting me see that so they celebrate from the time they step out of that old body this body is part of you it's what sleeps but you your spirit man never sleeps even when you're sleeping now your soul never sleeps that's a spiritual part of you your soul is awake you play music christian music at night you're feeding your soul if you play the word of god at night somewhere that's feeding your soul even things that like learning or mentoring tapes you're feeding your spirit man that's going in your soul what you hear goes in your soul and it can begin to change you some people i can't sleep in music i have it going 24 hours a day in my place in more than one room i want to saturate my walls i can walk in my home even if it's not on and i hear the music that plays all the time that remains in the room your words remain in your rooms where you live sometimes i walk in someone's home and hear things i don't like i'll step outside and i'll pray over them and break the enemy off at their home images remain in your home by stuff you watch we need a great understanding of our soul your soul doesn't sleep okay you feed it 24 hours a day your body gets fed three times a day sometimes five times a day in america probably five times or more and now you're all eating cake so you can add that to your wrist so your body gets fed several times a day right your spirit man god said sometimes once a week i feed mine every day i make sure my spirit man gets back the word of god whether i listen to it whether i read it or i listen to powerful speakers online now we got the internet god designed the internet by the way not the devil it does not belong to the devil amen and these words of god coming literally some people will have angelic beans come out of their computers this is a portal this is a portal it is a portal your computer is a portal your ipad is a portal whatever can carry images or transmit stuff it can transmit heaven or the other place you need to be careful what you put on here amen i'll be somewhere and i'll see things up like i'll see things come right out of the tv i'm very careful i need to tissue somebody i'm very careful about what my eyes see okay i don't want to put stuff in my soul it doesn't belong there i'm going to keep it sorry i'm going to keep my soul pure i want it pure and it's not that hard it's a lifestyle being like christ should be a lifestyle it's not a sunday thing although i'm thankful people actually go on sunday of course some people can't even go on sunday now but i want you know california is breaking all the rules right now california has had it with the lockdowns that's right and i noticed he's been speaking about america and that's what i'm leading up to you have to remember what the father said okay the enemy is not in power right now in this country it is not god still is trump still is he is a president he is the one who's in power he is in office so when the righteous are in office or they're in power the people rejoice that's why he's telling everybody to eat cake amen the worst thing you can do to the enemy right now is to you celebrate like it's already happened you know what this scripture says call those things that be not as though they were that means you act like they've already happened so if you believe victory is coming and it is then you should act like it he sets a table a table is what you eat from it's what you celebrate from that's what he's saying he's saying that scripture even the myth of every one thing around you he can set a temple of celebration for your life and it missed everything around you and that will begin to combat darkness because the enemy sees he's not winning hallelujah our life gets brighter that he put in us when he got born again you got part of the light of god put in you some people's light would blind the enemy some of you can already see it when you begin to stand for what is right and you don't step back that life society begins to blind the enemy and he gets terrified and i ask the father what else can they do they prayed they fasted they laid on their face they've encouraged people and he said they can eat cake and celebrate [Applause] and every time he's called me up to heaven guess what they're doing they're eating cake because they've already seen the victory happen amen the father's been from the beginning to the end in the end of the beginning and then he'll let you know you were there too before he made this earth and he sent you from himself he had already been from the end of the beginning the beginning of the end he'd already been there you were in him when he went there and made things you were in him living in him you've already been yourself from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning because you're you're eternal beings we are eternal amen you're born again one day you'll be immortal immortal means you can't sin you can't get sick you can't die that's your future some of those behind that barbed wire will not have that future amen so these are great days that we're living in but the father chose to explain things to you so it's perfectly clear to you like it is to him our country has a great future because it will impact this world we will be we'll we will be changers atmosphere changers amen we walk into place because of christ in us the atmosphere will change smith wigglesworth used to walk into places and people would fall on their face begin to cry out to god that was a measure the measure he's given us now is beyond that original measure you drive past people's homes and they'll in your homes fall out under the glory people will see your roofs on fire because the fire of god in you in your home people will walk in and out of the walls to go speak someplace one day i won't come by plane i'll walk through the wall and come right out on the platform these are greater days of glory that we're entering into and he has to expose the evil and it has to be dealt with it can't be taken off the earth at this time but it will be crushed back and we will rule with great authority and dominion we were given it by christ jesus he never let anything stop him in this earth not even time he was over time he would step in the spirit realm and walk through the people he didn't walk around the people i've been to the amount of the precipice i've been there i was in israel last year on the tour that they bushwhacked me with because no one told me i'd have to be on the bus at 8 am [Laughter] when i laid down at 7 am and no one told me as the speaker of this tour to 18 places in israel i climbed the mountains i went down inside of mountains i've been to every significant place in israel the dimensions in the bible and i thought i was going to have a nice place to speak in the hotel and i do a couple meetings a day and i have to go here my husband was laughing the whole time and i tell them steve showed someone you bushwhacked me they hooked a microphone on me and recorded everything he said wherever god says the prophets i do it well he had something to say everywhere i went where the fire came down before elijah i got to speak on the sea of galilee they had a fox so thick the boat couldn't leave so i commanded the fog to lift and it was gone in three minutes i don't tolerate the weather being over me it wasn't over christ was it right he was not afraid of anything in the enemy the enemy would run from him the demons would scream when he would be around them and he walked as a righteous man on this earth he chose he had to choose with his will he had to live just like us he was still the son of god but he's also called the son of man he's appointed with every single thing that we're tempted with or attacked with and yet he was victorious in every way in his life why because he was setting an example for us you can live that way i live that way it's different but it's fun it's fun to walk holy because you choose to be holy people say you can't be holy i said the bible says we can it says he's coming for a church this is one of the reasons why he's not coming right now should be pretty evident the world will know us by our love for each other i challenge you to go talk to some worldly people and ask them if you think the church loves one another it says in the bible they will know us by our love for each other so guess what he's not coming right now roll up your rapture rug and stick in the closet it clearly says the wealth of the wicked and they sure have a lot that's been pretty evident for everybody the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just and the righteous that has not been transferred yet are you willing to leave without that it says even by christ himself the works i did you will do how many people do you know are walking on water raising the dead that stinks they're in the grave so long making food appear everywhere wherever they need it to appear stepping in a boat and transporting it in time itself stepping in the spirit room and walking through places we need to already be doing that because those greater works are coming rapidly when you will raise the dead of the funeral that was cremated where you will stop an earthquake that started until it to put it back the way it was before it came where you tell the weather what it can and cannot do we have to be ready for those things because he's not holding them back once he does this what he is going to do is setting the platform for us he's not doing it just to bless the world it is for the body of christ to step up and be who we were called to be you were born here because he wants you here you're an american you're here to represent god himself that's why he made america he calls it his gift his first gift was his son his second gift to the world was america where people walk in righteousness and they have liberty and freedom and justice in their country where they honor and respect him and they're not ashamed of who he is the moral majority in this country did vote on november 3rd and they chose justice liberty and freedom we didn't choose the other stuff that the devil tried slipping in their lives are not going to be good because they chose what was wrong and they feed upon people and they destroy people they want to crush our country they want to make it into a third world country they don't care about anybody's color of their skin they care about nothing but evil and wickedness hurting and harming they will use anything they can to make their point and they will lie every time they do it so god is not tolerating what they have said will happen it will not happen and it will not remain and it will not be forever it will not be very long down the road before what he showed me will happen he showed me when that freedom is announced he showed me when they will be forced to announce the election was [Applause] [Music] stolen for these four years he needs to continue what he has started god gave him to start in this country i think he's going to be a little bit more tempered having had to see all the evil but i promise you he despises evil and when god first showed me trump he said he is an all-american boy who is all for america that's how god himself described him and he has lived that before all of us even with a hate never and our history our country has a president been so wrongly accused and hated and just people feed on that i mean they feed evil feeds on that and then when others came in to join them and decided to collude with them that means it became a part of what they were planning to block everything we said that was truth they wouldn't allow they don't want people to know the truth they think if they can keep the truth from being heard that what they want will happen but they're wrong about that too some networks will be lost they won't exist anymore because of the lies they conspired to overthrow this country anyone who committed conspiracy to overthrow the presidency or the overseer of the country are going to prison amen please don't hear about already overseas they're making arrests for those who from other countries leaders of other countries people in high places in other countries have already been arrested and i think they're going to get as many from there as they can and then they're going to it's going to happen here you will see you will see justice justice will be served amen [Applause] to miss your destiny nor your future amen it's just going to get greater and greater in the days to come these are not the days of great darkness there will not be cities burning other than the ones they burned their south and all those cities that have been burned people were paid to do that they were all hired even the people for black lives matter antifa they have paid for all of that to be done not to help anyone they're using them they even make promises to china for things and now people are wanting to collect on the promises so now some of them behind the barbed wire are hiding because they can't deliver what they thought what they would already have in their hand by now they thought we'll have civil war half the people will be dead we'll just go in and collect everything and take over [Music] we're not gonna have civil war we don't want civil war we have freedom we have our lives we love our families so they're never going to get us to do that amen and this is from the father they will never get your guns there's far too many red lakes in america he even shocks me sometimes with some of the things that he says but i have to agree because i know some of those run nets he said they'll never reach them they'll be dead before they can get to them one of the reasons why they haven't done anything is we can still get them because we have our arms it's written in our papers we have the right to bear arms is that correct we have many freedoms and liberties given to us in our constitution they're trying to twist everything they can it's still not gonna work and until god i'm glad you're gonna do something quicker than later because the rednecks i'm gonna wait much longer my brother has a hotline to him you haven't heard about my brother you go back and look at some of those videos you hear about him he is all for justice he has to make out himself he has a hotline from homeland security and some other groups that are organized should they need their help their guns are ready and trump said there's a reason why i said go home and go home and stay safe you know i will be back he's trying to keep us you know not not get upset or not have fear come in us and the other thing god promised was he will take the virus off the face of the earth [Applause] [Music] devious purposes to bring heart to you the social distancing was to keep us apart so we wouldn't come together although the bible is very clear don't forsake the gathering together of yourselves and so he's against social distancing in case you wonder he doesn't like it there's no social distancing in heaven and there's no mask in heaven there's not even handshakes choose only hugs and i keep telling people we're gonna have a mass burning party one day i am not ignorant to the fact that there are some people who have compromised lives already you know they have issues if they want to wear them let them wear them i'm not against them wearing them i'm against me being forced to wear one when i don't need what i [Music] and i don't like it every time they say the new normal they can have them in normal but it's not going to be in this country safer to apart no we're not safer apart right that's never been true we're safer together amen we're here together we're in this together and we have a god who has a plan he says he hasn't gone on dates everyone else pip so they've jumped off the wagon they're wagging a victory in celebration they just think we're just going to give it and i'm not rolling over to anybody no i'm not giving that up i know god has a plan and hang in there you're going to be really happy that you were some of the ones who said all along victory is coming and everyone will have to eat their words but they'll still be happy that we're free amen so you remember jesus who we belong to and gave ourselves to hold your life in his hand no man holds your life in their hand he wants us all to be free even the bible said god never intended for a person to be over us he wasn't all for the kings at all he didn't appoint kings man wanted a king to be maybe you didn't know that back in the old days they demanded to have a king be over them and so from that point on there's always been leaders presidents kings those in authority over people that's why he said when the righteous are in power the people rejoice because they have a good one when the wicked is they're not going to rejoice amen we are rejoicing amen hallelujah so i won't talk but a few minutes more because you know i'm you know when i'm finally awake which i'm kind of awake you don't know but i'm actually sleeping it's hard to get up in the morning for me that's my that's my night time and i tell people it's not the next day until i go to sleep and i wake up then it's the next day my family has mostly adapted to the way uh my hours are i like that since i was little my husband used to go to sleep at ten o'clock no matter what was going on he can hang in there until midnight at least sometimes one in the morning my mom will hang in there to two or three in the morning with me she's gonna be 90 next year and she said if she had her way she'd be taking a plum switch up to that barbed wire and be making some changes herself [Laughter] she's still my mom and i'm blessed that she lives with me but she definitely has her own opinions about things and she's not happy with it either but she also understands and she does pray for people people who are seniors in certain situations in their life she prays all the time for them she actually has an anointing for people for married couples that can't have children she's highly anointed if she prays for you i have a baby in nine months it has happened over and over and over usually when she comes to me she has her own prayer line so she's brought many babies from heaven to earth by praying for people releasing her anointing to to bring them from heaven to earth for god she still does that she still prays for people and it works her faith is there she operates i operate you know in the revelation zone she operates in the baby zone so i i love what i do i love people i can honestly say i love you i love you with the father's love and he does have great plans for us and i wish everyone could hear these words he cares he doesn't like sickness and disease he doesn't like anger he doesn't like violence he doesn't like life being taken from us that's nothing he purposed for us and so if people don't know jesus christ i will encourage anybody watching right now that you make sure you receive jesus christ as your savior it gives you more than just hell insurance okay it gives you authority dominion it helps you to step into the supernatural and in these days of greater glory we'll see things never seen before on the earth with the signs and wonders that will be done people will be shocked and stunned to see really the power of god in us because of his son so i look forward to seeing you all again and i i pray that you have a blessed day oh i'm absolutely going to be speaking at the inaugural prayer breakfast okay i got to pray for him back in 2000 when they had the last prayer breakfast i actually got to pray for him for the vice president for their families for the future of america and i'm telling you god and don't and you reserve your judgment for pence okay don't judge people when you don't know everything you don't understand covert activities you don't know what's going on so reserve your judgment for him okay they're very close they really care for each other i know people in their administration so don't jump on something because you see something or hear something you can't tell everything that's going on especially if it's covert it won't be covered amen so we will see what is decided about that what decisions are made i do know that god did pick pence for eight years also like he did the president and i need to let you know that means if trump won the election that means vice president pence also won that election amen so we'll see what god's going to do i do want you to get ready to celebrate in your life like you never have before eat cake in moderation and right now i had already asked them if i could teach you a dance [Applause] if i if i could teach this dance to you i'm kind of fine if i actually have now i do have music can you all play everybody dance now can you dance now i'm teaching them you might have to play that one from your phone dancing [Applause] [Music] everybody i'm trying to stop it first because i have to teach it to you first because we can play it up here through this pa system my husband's brother now we're going to okay this first if you go why do you do this because it's heaven culture okay uh church is supposed to be fun amen it is god in heaven but when i started speaking not only did i have to show up with my pink hair which freaked out a lot of pastors i don't know why i thought you know and i even knew like 40 some pastors in mine was sitting they said you've gone too far you fell off the edge so now we can't work with you it's just while some people will look and go know that you don't qualify anymore well you know the holy spirit already warned me and he i actually saw angels doing this dance that we're going to learn in my own church we had a prophet several prophets coming at a panel they did a q a session and all their angels were standing behind them on the platform because i see the angels see all of yours by the way they're excited because they you're going to do this famous they're going to be doing this dance with you okay and so i saw them doing this dance and i'm like well that's wow that looks like fun what was that the holy spirit said they're doing the revelation dance because the people have received revelation this day and they're excited and then i went to canada about two weeks later and i was speaking with people there we had four hour meetings they would break for lunch and we'd come back i said boy they did it and and in the second meeting the hospital said you're going to teach them all that dance what dance the humor in all this is all three of my daughters their gift is dance they do ballet do all the traditional beautiful stuff they're anointed people been raised from the dead when they dance they've been healed when they dance it is who they are and i don't dance at all i've been kicked out of jazzercise classes okay and now he's telling me all my daughters laugh hysterically every time i talk about it you have to teach them you're teaching everyone in there this dance because we want them to celebrate they're going to learn to celebrate when they receive revelation they need to celebrate and so i did and i think the only song i at that time knew about was when the saints come marching in so i talked to him and so when i get back to where i live um i heard this music and the holy spirit said that's the music we want you to learn to teach it to them and that's that's that's a secular song he said yes but we like that song we want everyone to tell us they're going to dance when they get to heaven they may as well practice now and so ever since then i have taught this dance to that song and does anybody here know that dance anyone i know you do you really come up here if anyone has done the students before you can come up here a couple of you come up here everything on camera is going to be doing this dance too they will jump in and do it a lot of them already know it it's actually caught the revelation names but for some reason because i talked to my angels everybody calls it if you google angel dance it will bring up congregations all over the world doing this dance and so it's it has three movements that's all i'll tell you what they each mean and then i'll show you with you the first one is that um i'm receiving revelation it's treasure so i'm digging up treasure that's that's the first movement the second one is i'm celebrating the revelation the third one is i'm gonna share it everywhere [Applause] and i didn't know anything about counts or beats or nothing okay i can't even play a tina marine i was going off the stage that is not my gift i can't even keep me to that and so someone uh the holy spirit said you gotta do to account eight and i'm like i was coming and then this angel appears again when i wake up in the morning which is noon this angel appears to me in my room and he goes watch i don't know if he was happy with the assignment or not he said watch this and he did the whole thing and he was speaking he said wow we're digging up revelation that's like treasure you know he did it to the count of eight he said now we're celebrating the revelation and now we're gonna share it everywhere and he said he looked at me goes did you get that i said i got it he goes good you go oh my gosh so that's what we're going to do so we're going to practice so we're going to practice up here first okay are you ready uh you can play with me okay so we're going to practice it first you can watch his practices and you're all going to get a practice [Music] ready [Music] okay cut now it's your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] your turn are all getting ready to do this dance with you it's crazy so we're going to start when i say start we'll all start together the thing is when you turn around don't do like rapid okay because somebody's going to be halfway in this when you're already going all the way so you're kind of tired together so are you ready yeah okay here we go we're gonna practice go ahead and start the music [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's go [Music] [Applause] okay we're going to go three times all the way around and then we can all just go okay okay are you ready to start the music your kids can come up if you want to wait wait wait wait wait everybody [Applause] [Music] okay here we go again [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh i can tell you uh probably my hardest group to teach was a group of 80 baptist ministers [Applause] god doesn't cut any i was invited in canada they had a monthly prayer meeting unit for like 15 years right they'd have a guest speaker well they didn't tell anybody i was going to be there so when we got there margaret and i sat at this table we could see eyes piercing us right who's this woman with pink hair i'm like margaret i think they got tired feather feathering in their mind and this little guy gets up and they all knew him because there was a few catholics there there were a few presbyterians a few but mostly retired practice winners not even like new young ones and by the time i got up and i introduced myself and and the guy played his little accordion for worship that wasn't enough to burn my flesh all their angels were behind them laughing so hard they could hardly stand up and so i said i was here to share heaven they got to call me up in heaven and they were like this there was not one bit of emotion on their faces they were so angry at the the guy who was the head of the breakfast and i said i'm just going to press him and i started talking about what it was like to stand before the son of god and of course in their mind i could read it no one can stand see the face of god then die they would die i mean that's what was in their minds and then about five minutes in they started to cry i saw tears coming down their eyes and then across their arms and they sat there they were so undone by the love of god and explaining what it was like to see before him and the ways of consuming passion that came from him and how you well he welcomed you home to heaven as his son and daughter no one cared in that room that i was a woman nobody cared i had pink hair they began to shake visibly shake sitting in their seats because of the presence of the holy spirit they didn't even know they didn't know how to respond they didn't know what to do all they could do was shake and then when we got vienna said now i'm going to teach you something they do in heaven by that time they didn't care what i said i said so heaven does this dance angels do the same uh revelation about heaven and about the father and about his son they do this dance would you all like to learn this dance and they yelled at the top of their lungs yes and we had our little computer with us and we were going to plug it in to get the music that music and i said when we do it to this music you may not understand but we have to do everybody dance now because you know they don't dance in church they don't raise hands in church and i'll tell you before we were done they were dancing raising their hands and we couldn't get our music converted so the little guy said well i can play you know uh when the saints come marching in on my little thing got up and learned that dance and they were laughing and they were crying in her hands okay in the beginning when he did his little recording thing he was saying it's okay to raise your hand god won't strike you down and none of them raised their hand they were all like they were doing the whole thing the best part was they were going to have a second meeting and they called all their friends you have to come this person didn't say lady this person has been the handwritten talked about the throne of god there was twice as many pastors in that room it was like there were 200 glasses in that room and the animals couldn't wait until i said now we're going to learn a dance it was life changing life changing for all of them so if they can do it you can do it amen and we did that all over america wherever i traveled in the world everybody learned that dance and we know some pastors that had it taken on purpose and they welcome people to the church then they play the dance on the screen and everybody gets up they either want to stay or they want to leave but heaven is like that they celebrate all the time you know and people love their life there they can't wait for you to get there they make plans for you they get these little things to actually record places that they go that they can keep that they know you will love specifically to go and see in heaven so you're going to be really busy when you get there amen so the other thing i want to do is lay hands on every person here amen and i'm going to give out importations to everybody amen if you want it i promise you that i'm healthy and whole but you know it says that that you get implications by the laying on of hands is that right so i'm not going to mock laying my hand on you i'm actually going to put my hand on you right here i'm going to release the love of god so the way i usually do this is we get a line going and you walk i'll like i'll stand here and that line will form all the way around and you come up to me and i'm just going to say come here honey are you just come up here and i'll go i i impart the love of god into you and it will go from here because i operate in it it'll go here into your heart okay and you'll begin to feel his presence in you so and remember whatever it is you need from him because this is from him you can ask for if you need healing if you need finances if you need you know things in your mind restored whatever it is you can ask me for it at that moment okay so oh and make sure you say i receive it okay everybody practice i receive it and that's you saying yes that you do accept that so remember you have not because you asked not so by coming being willing to come up here you're saying you're going to have it amen so we need to get that line somebody needs to get that line going maybe i think we usually start where we start from the back or the front i don't remember yeah so i think the last the last row come around here and just get in line right here and as you receive it just go back and sit down this doesn't take very long because i'm not going to go to every person and take hours to do that okay this is an accelerate accelerated way to receive we're entering into accelerated days so it won't take very long to do that all right that's what i was thinking

[Applause] if you see me making hand motions i'm copying the angels in the room they never are stagnant they're always moving they're always moving and so they really loved anything that worships the lord every time they go wild leaving in the throne room when when you're worshiping or adoring jesus christ just for a while but a lot of them they were going like this well most of them were going like this except the ones behind her one behind her was going so i have to call you when i'm watching it's hard not to do it the throne room is a powerful powerful place it is so amazing to have been there and the seraphim when the seraphim starts singing they come out of the glory cloud over the throne and their hair is on fire it's like blue fire and they sing and they sing and they sing and they sing i keep inviting them to come so if they ever showed them though your hair probably turned blue and catch on fire there's some of the fire carriers in the throne room but to be there on purpose there's nothing like no one is up there crying that they died as hard as that might seem to you to imagine they're not no one's crying no one is sad no one is grieving no one remembers anything bad that rhyme that wasn't me his holy spirit they they don't they're so in the glory really and that thing about for all of sin that comes short of the glory of god it's not about you committing sins i hear that you know if they don't have revelation they don't understand what that means that means you you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying it for him releasing it for him it comes out of you like shockwaves begin to permeate everything it touches every person every place we we we don't do that we don't know how to do that it's something we'll do now in this time you are in one of the most important times on the face of the earth one of the most blessed times regardless of what your i see your ears here no you were chosen from the beginning of time to be here you were meant to be here all of your family members are so excited you're here amen you're not looking at the mass you're not looking at the virus which is you know pretty much gonna be taken off the face of the earth by god it's being used against everybody it really is i'm not saying it's not there i'm not saying it hasn't touched some people but it's nothing like what they're saying it is you need to know the truth i bring the truth i have to speak the truth okay all of this that you're living in now will be like dust in a very short time acceleration in this world and not just america this whole thing is yes it's here we know it's here uh we we talk about it we share what do we do but let me tell you it's worldwide what god is going to do he he is planning and his plan will take place it will say it will say god's will god's way not man's way not the enemy's way it will be god's way this country will be known by the glory of god the presence of god and he's setting it up you yes to understand there's covert operations in heaven and there's covert operations on earth and maybe you don't know all that but yes things are happening you cannot see but you will see them suddenly say suddenly it will all be known say everything will be known all the stuff about the elections will be known [Applause] and we will celebrate [Applause] and i know wonderful people talk about revivals a lot of people talk about moves of god a revival is kind of i don't want to say stagnant but it's kind of centralized in certain places what's coming isn't going to be centralized moves of god will come together to create one thing and that is called a habitation say habitation is what is coming it can't be controlled it can't be stopped and it can't be changed it's coming from heaven and we will be the habitation no one can move us or take us from the place god puts us so no matter how people are putting it what really is coming is a habitation of god yes that has never happened before on the face of the earth and you will not just get delivered you'll get to share it you get to experience it you get to carry it say carry it say the knowledge of the glory will happen because we will carry that glory all over this world so don't think of yourself of being left out okay that's not possible say if i'm alive and breathing i'm part of it that's how it's gonna be this time amen amen say for generations step out of your box and just say it for generations until god is done the boy will grow and build and cover the whole earth like the waters cover the sea the world will know there is a god and they better decide amen the other thing that i know is truth we can all say this together nothing that was done through cheating stealing lying unjust accusations will not escape being brought to justice [Applause] and let me tell you the god side knows a whole lot that's been going on that maybe you don't know and i am talking about trump that's okay if you're not okay come outside we'll get you saved and you know the person who likes him the least is the devil truly the one who's most terrified of him of trump is the devil say the devil doesn't like him maybe i should one of the few presidents who has said to the people i'm here to give your country back to you and i'm here to welcome jesus back into the white house he wasn't always perfect everyone knows that especially the fake news but they're stuck on it they all they do is hit replay and i've traveled all over the world when all that stuff started people were what's wrong with your news i want nothing not my news and not my news by the way you'd be better off not listening to anybody okay they know that they can brainwash you they know that they can compromise your soul to believe exactly what they're saying and that's why they keep saying it if you've never heard things about people that have gotten brainwashed that's how they do it they get you in a place so you will believe what they're saying then they'll say it over and over and over and guess what's going to come out of your soul say as a man thinketh in his heart that's his soul so is he that's what's happened to all of them their souls have been compromised they know it okay the darkness knows it all the others who are part of all that mess they all know that and that's why they keep it going that's why they don't want the truth to be known that's why they don't want us saying anything that's why they block you or be in you whatever they're doing they're so terrified that people will hear the truth and begin to believe it they don't want them i know i know i have i have really close friends who just did that they fed on it they're not the same people they're not the same people that's why every now and then anyway free soul checkup and i offer help to all those out there who have been compromised lose it from your soul and i'm really serious about that he made us that we can loose things remember the keys of the kingdom what you loose on earth will be loose from heaven what you bind on earth can be bound on him loose all the bad all the negative all the hurt trauma tragedies all of the fear all the fake news every word you've ever heard lose it all from your soul heaven will come down and pull it out and they really do that they will do that i've seen people change in three minutes from doing that then then you bind the things of god i choose my will to find the life of god the love of god the presence of god his will his way his word i find the truth to my soul and there is no one on the earth that can take it out of you that's what they need to heal the world actually needs a soul checkup right so it's not that hard to be free it's not number one you have to know that you're not you need to know when you've been deceived because the devil for eons and ages always use fear as his number one weapon now it's deception it really is because when you say yes to deception you're deceived and when you're deceived you can't see the truth understand the truth or even want to know the truth so this whole country and other people all over the world i always do those soul checkups if you hear me doing it that's why i'm doing it i want them to be free right that's right and after the first election i offered it free to all the democrats a post-election therapy i called it to have your soul set free and a lot of people did it and i have that a lot of people call me contact let me play says hey i did that i'm free we will get some new networks i promise you the truth is some of them will close and be shut down we'll keep on with the truth okay from the justice that's coming some of them will lose their network and you don't even know this but some ceos have already started stepping down the thing about deception is when you aren't deceived and you willingly knowingly do what's wrong and you know commit crime you're quite aware that it just might not work yeah so this whole thing that they're doing when they see isn't working they just put more barbed wire around them he's not god they can't stop god i'm not going to stop god so i also knew this that when these things the landslide starts can't stop it that's called justice amen a lot of them will try to run some may end their life we need to pray for those people because they don't want they don't want what that word was saying up there about the shame they didn't want people to know what they were doing but everyone's going to know what everybody was doing because it's already been collected amen and so they they have proof all the proof they need and i will just mention this for those who don't know this is a truth meeting how about that this is the truth the truth is that they've already been uh tried in a different kind of a court and been found um guilty and uh in case you didn't know uh trump is actually a president i just say that he did win he wants anyone they tried to steal it it's not going to work [Music] and the crazy thing in all this is they're trying they when i say they i mean the left delivers whatever you want to call them they god calls me villains i'll just say what he does the villains we're hoping we would just give up and do what they wanted they forgot one thing we we the people do not a third world country where we are in control say we are free and we're staying free man that made a big mistake and one thing he didn't consider that we wouldn't don't all dumb goblin has happened no they're not smart because we run closer to him we get closer to him we hear him clear we become more dangerous against hell that's what happens when you press on god's people that's exactly what happened so mistake number one was that you thought everybody would just dump god and give him up they don't know us say they don't know us they're about to find out amen [Music] so that was their first mistake the second mistake is we're already free we live free say we're free right now we aren't bound get anything to villains has written down his new laws and i have to say this to you because the father said this to him he said tell them this please it says when the righteous are in power the people rejoice so why don't you rejoice because the truth is the humans have no power they are not in power say the villains are not in power the righteous are in power so we're going to keep rejoicing while they remove the others the best show on earth jesus christ wiping out hell these are going to be glorious days and i am so excited to be here okay i got born again i i came out born again i think i do remember at age four receiving christ and because i'm a senior i saw him step inside of me you can't tell a child is four years old that he's not real and that doesn't really happen you're really more open to it than most people when they get older it's a little bit harder because your mind gets in the way i saw him step inside of me i liked it so much when i turned five for my birthday i did it all over again this is how precious jesus he stepped out to step back in [Music] for a birthday present so living life with heaven all the time is definitely different i tell people all the time i'm i'm like an eight-year-old if you pick on me you're picking on nate road they forget it really soon right they see a pretty flower a crawling bug or a piece of cake and they forget it so he really did i i worked with ceos most of the time i was i love business i'm a business person actually i'm a ceo hey this is how we dress when you get in here and having your ceo right they're the best apparel ever you don't get a nightgown in the bathrobe and having people i hope you didn't not for the one who owns everything he's not going to give you that that's not what people wear up there you have an apparel wardrobe room it's like a thousand square feet maybe more than that and every kind of beautiful amazing thing because there's so many things to do in heaven you can't ride a roller coaster in a gown in case you wonder i wouldn't try it for so long i grew up in the church trust me from the day i was born i was in church and i was there for every revival every special visitor it didn't matter if it lasted six weeks i was there every night for six weeks along with all my siblings and my parents would space the older ones in between the younger ones you know when you got 15 i mean several people i was i was an adult at age eight that's why he kept me video see i earned it because from that age i had to help take care of my 12 of my siblings everyone was a chief okay they were all in charge all highly anointed uh you know they they needed to be tempered a whole lot they practiced on me and from a very young age i could see in the spirit room i understood it being the father son holy spirit i remember when i invited the holy spirit he came inside me like a whirlwind and he's been there ever since and i can tell you how that happens who wants to know how he can be everywhere at the same time anybody want to know he has unlimited layers of himself one of the key words in heaven is layers there's layers of everything layers of space you can have like 10 places on your space your one mansion's on and it's hard to explain except when they teach me how to say it you can see it and so on your mansion let's say you have a city i've seen some people's mansions the size of new york city so maybe you better expand your thinking say expand that and on your management property there are these doors suspended just above the ground a beautiful door different colors different doors like around your or your whole property where your actual mansion is sitting on whether it's in the middle of the crystal sea under the crystal sea on top of the mountain spices in the valley of the falls uh wherever it is that he puts it uh on that property will be doors and if if you open the door you can see the other space that yours with places in there that are yours you can walk around the door like i could walk around this this is how there's no limit to space in heaven here's the door let's pretend this is the door you can walk around the door you see the door right you see it you can walk around it's just this but if you open the door you step into another whole area that belongs to you that could be in the valley of the falls the mansion out here is maybe on the beach of the crystal sea or the mountain spices so you get many he said what do you say i go to repair a place for you in my father's house a world not a flat place in the sky are many mansions i go there to prepare a place for you so he's not going to tell you any more than that oh until you get there and then you find out really how magnificent and amazing he is there's so many things adventure excitement intensity a joy humor all of that is in heaven that's why we have it here say it was there first it trickled down to here they have mountains they have valleys they have oceans you can ride a 200 foot wave and not die when you crash off of your board because you haven't done enough times up there the waves can change direction while you're on them okay they can open up they can swing you back and forth is heaven it says eyes have not seen your ear heard or entered in the heart or mind of man but he has prepared for you except and unless is revealed by the spirit of god i stand on that scripture for every time they've taken me every time they've shown me i can stand on that because of that i can see i can know and i can't understand and that's my commission my commission is to reveal heaven to this earth that's why i go all the time non-stop they have not stopped since 1996 taking me i used to try to count gave that up pretty soon and guess what when does he do it whenever he wants to why i gave him permission you have my permission to do with me whatever you want if you ever said that you better watch out because these are the days of the glorious signs and wonders that manifested signs with through the daughters and sons of god on the earth those aren't other beings who are going to come here and have it yes you say it's us we're your sons and daughters we'll manifest and demonstrate [Applause] hearing things and uh seeing things you never saw before and don't worry when he tells you you're going to hear him how does he do that uh step up and do that step out go up to the front of the funeral and raise the dead that was cremated [Music] [Applause] that happened a few times maybe facebook won't block it that's probably going to be replaced also by the way yeah they'll just be replaced and you know they didn't really do all that until guess who started running for office because he's a threat he said you can't be bought talk about trump again i don't mind insane it can't be bought can't be controlled they can't make him afraid and he already knows the truth so they can't convince him to lie they can't even deceive him he knew all of them before this started happening because the wealthy and the rich are invited to everybody's inner circle whether the good or not they know he knew the corruption that's why he was willing to do it we don't know what they're lying out of their teeth i know what they're doing i know all the stuff they're involved in no hey yes i will run and they were afraid from the day he said that they tried everything we could of 17 people trying to get that spot on the republican ticket and god told me i will eliminate them one by one by one and they will be forced to put him there guess what happened they were forced to put him there amen i know even even through history there's always been people that nobody else would have picked but god and some of them were very colorful yeah but if anybody ever heard all the stuff that was said against him they would think he wasn't worth anything and yet right now he's very valuable to god if anybody likes it or not he will be leading all this stuff that's going to be happening and while we've been out here some people not maybe y'all people are afraid not knowing what their life is going to be like how's everything what about all these horrible things being made from the villains laugh that's what heaven is doing about it there probably was never anything on the papers just so you know that they didn't waste the time to do it they whatever they can get away with the food people they're doing this is to say this is truth we just can't be deceived amen and most of people i've talked to i start to start a conversation anywhere in the airport the grocery store i don't care where it is so what did you think about the elections see i used to say hey i voted for trump 90 of everyone i talked to by the way you voted for trump yeah they did and the ones that didn't don't even know what the other ones are doing up there right now i confronted one of those the other day in my own yard yeah my husband hired him to mow front yard and came to the back he should have never done that i was about there i was back there because we released a home from friends of ours who were pastors in new york so uh the guy was replacing the little fertilizer fertilizer see i can't even think that what are they called where's my husband where are they putting the ground those tubes to kill the bugs that come in to eat your house up terminator see my natural brain don't ask me a question heaven spirit round future past you know anything about god father son holy spirit the 12 you know what are they the 12 the 24 elders know i know all of them already oh the seven spirits of god aren't just his attributes those are seven spiritual beings in case you wonder oh yeah they are actually seven smooth the wednesdays so they're seven spiritual beings it's one of the images they use god sends them on special assignments i laugh when you hear cloak and dagger that's usually about you know murder mysteries but actually holy spirit wears a club all the time he loves to he wears one the seven spirits of god wear them that came from heaven that's not a hell thing hell stole too many things okay say house deals because they can't create something new and so anyway so i was back there with a guy replacing those termite tubes and i said the same thing hey so uh he's up say he's a millennial too i said so what did you think about the elections i think they were stolen yes they were still on the lousy themselves they're all villains i want you to say what god calls them and then comes around the corner the other guy so what do you think about the elections oh i think i am so glad they got someone in there the other one was such a rotten lousy guy oh you're talking about fighting right might as well say his name yeah now i'm talking about something so oh no no no no he is the good guy do you know what the other ones are doing do you even know what they're doing well i know they're doing good things for this country but you cannot watch one single thing that they said they're doing and you don't know that they want to let all the terrorists in the world here with no pulse bar did you know they want to break down the law so all those human trafficking people can come through and just gather more to take out and and you obviously don't know that they're going to wipe out church completely because they don't want god here and this guy guy had already said to me god bless you well that's who you believe then you don't need to know those people up there because god's not blessing now he's going to remove them oh i don't think that let's just end this really quick conversation i would tell you they have all the evidence if they had no no i'm not talking about civil civil evidence i'm talking about military tribunal evidence i'm talking videos i'm talking testimonies i'm talking things that have been taped that you would be so horrified to find out what they actually have been doing even before they started their what they knew who they connected to what they've been doing all around this world it's already there it's there and they have it these guys who are in there now faking who they think they are they will be wiped out and god will say exactly who our president is back there maybe not in that spot but he's going to play back he will still run this country he is president he doesn't have to be proven to be president he already has won he won the other guy over here going yes yay the termite guy and this guy was probably in his late 40s and this young guy knew more than he did he was he was very aware of what was going on you'd be surprised if you talked to how many people voted for the other guy don't know anything that they're doing because all they know is they hate the other one and that was their plan we will bring this i'm serious it's what they do in other countries they brainwash people to believe what they want to then they go do whatever they feel like that's how those people live that's how people live in venezuela and other countries they know what socialism and communism is and they don't want it this way they try to escape so they made a few announcements and the whole rest of their campaign on the left was how horrible he is and if you ask him why is he horrible well i don't know but he's just i can free you from that right now in your soul do you wanna then they run come over here i'll get rid of that of your soul you need to get that out of your shoulder you can live a normal life again and actually tomorrow's when i talk about america this is this commercial for tomorrow amen because heaven is celebrating everywhere right now they're celebrating because they do know what time it is on god's timeline and if people don't know this is i'm talking about pastors and i won't talk about pastors revenge as well okay evangelists kind of got it made because they're still going for the big harvest right now we're going to talk about the naked harvest we're going on with the big harvest that's what we're here for what no you should be a voice for truth no matter what else you do you should say the truth let people know where you stand with what god wants what god asks of us let life live let life live and don't take it amen and anyone who wants to take life you're already in a really hard spot but god if you voted for life to be taken from babies you are in trouble and i can honestly say that according to the word of god you're in trouble you are and one day you'll be falling on your face repenting when you find out the truth of what the other ones were doing continually amen so i gotta let go let's let go and set it back here somewhere up here because god is right now beginning to create that habitation and people need to know number one the world's not ending now i'm talking about heaven it's not over say it's not over i just the father says it's over not even jesus knows when it's over and i have new spheres not coming for a church that is fighting each other angry at each other despising each other spitting on each other shall i continue coming for a church and a bride who has no sin and no flesh showing up in flesh and fleshy fighting it is what the spiritual mind is life refreshing mind it is he said i offer you life and death what do you say to choose my life a lot of people miss that this time around because life is what you're going to get everybody's going to get life even the ones who didn't want it it's going to come it's not going to stop from coming and he knows his timing he has a timeline around his behind his own throne his throne is in the middle of the throne room it's not on the back wall and you'd always seen these paintings there's god on his throne and there's millions of people all over here who can't get to him he didn't ever do that it's in the middle when four sets of steps and people run up there all the time all the time if you make it to heaven you're going to get to see god okay you get to see father you get to see jesus i never understood these people that said there's levels you have to get you after you get up there no the bible doesn't say does that no no it says the pure in heart shall see god amen and that means it can be now once you get born again or when you go to heaven people need to get over that no one can see the face of god and live oh trust me everything within you that was wrong would die instantly if you saw him but the bible clearly says the pure heart shall see god right so guess what i see him i see him i see jesus christ i didn't see the invisible spirit of god i see the outline of his person usually fires going around him or whirlwinds of the rainbow or going around him but i see him he's big and he is called the drama king in heaven well he sure creates drama every time he touches the earth doesn't he they were not suspecting him back in the day when he fell and began to do things that people were spinning and jumping over furniture and they really were doing crazy wild things way back they didn't even know what they didn't really know what they had they just knew it felt good we should be well acquainted with it he is my best friend and he speaks to me all the time guess what he's always speaking always say always are you hearing him you're hearing but maybe we need to unclutter our soul the more stuff you get in the layers you are a later being holy spirit as unlimited layers thank you holy spirit for reminding me i was supposed to talk about that see i told you you don't smell the time holy spirit is very powerful being he's still with celebration and joy drama excitement that's him if there's enough roar in heaven holy spirit there then i get corrected doctrinally i thought he moved to the earth why don't you have a conversation with him i'll let you talk to him about that and see what he says to you okay he has unlimited layers of himself so when he involves you you don't get a little piece you get a hold of him he takes a layer of himself and throws it in you that's how that happens unlimited layers that's how he can be everywhere all the same time all over the world know everything see everything hear everything you can invade any places he's invited to somebody's not invited to he's the most exciting single beings the most excited being in existence right now right now i see jesus can't come back right now the father's up there delegating through governmental stuff all the stuff that's going on right now on earth but the holy spirit well he didn't move his operations here that doctrinal person was right he did jesus said when i leave i will send who the holy spirit the comforter the one who will walk alongside hey walk alongside yeah unless you invite him in if you ever wonder what spiritual protocol is even in heaven you must invite okay you must invite i'll prove it you invited jesus christ right yes say yes he did we can take care of that right now [Music] you must invite jesus christ to be your savior repent of your sins invite him to come in this is all scriptural john 3 16 he will come into you he also has unlimited layers and he made you with unlimited layers of you everyone in here has layers that look just like you is this exciting yeah it should be it's the way you meet your soul your soul your emotions are all your layers the more emotional we are the more layers of you you have in you what does it do with those layers well when you get born again because you invited him right he takes one and he seats it in heavenly places and it's you it literally is it literally really truthfully is you it's a part of you it looks just like you still connected to your soul so all around your will let's say this is your will it's a strong column off of that from all these layers that look just like you but they move like they're living because they are this is a spiritual part of you not talking about your flesh your flesh suit is your flesh seep okay until it gets super glued together at the end that's glorified when you're glorified that'll happen one day okay you don't get glorified in heaven you can glorify when your spirit person who moves to heaven while your body rests or if it's blown up or eaten by a shark or burnt up to nothing he knows where every cell and molecule of you is this is true because some people think you can't get cremated say it's cheaper say it's cheaper your family member was standing right here said why didn't you cremate me you would have saved money and god will still put everybody back together again one day because is he going to leave all the people who were burnt out somewhere no no you get your body back say yay he's going to look a whole lot better [Music] your spiritual bodies didn't turn you right now you go man i look good because guess what everyone says in heaven man you look good you look funny you look good too but they recognize you it says so in the bible it says you will be known that means your images you'll be known as you were known on the earth so people will know you everyone in heaven knows your first name everyone's going to want a hug say no masks in heaven no social distancing in heaven no handshakes in heaven they give up hugs father abraham will probably be the first one if you make it to the gate because sometimes your family members are waiting outside the gate when you come up to heaven there's a landing place you come no matter how they bring you in jesus's own chariot somebody's chariot a spaceship a world war ii biplane whatever people come in many different things whatever would delight you the most is how you're going to be taken some people step in the elevator and they just go they don't want to mess around they're the people with few layers in their soul okay they got five layers just taken young their angels stepped in this spiritual elevator they step in with the person and up they go and they're there they bypass going to see the whole galaxies and everything which he will take you to see if you want to so even leaving is an experience is a powerful experience but you have layers in you and he made you that way number one spirit soul and body shall we count them say spirits that's a layer body that's a layer soul that's a layer even your body has layers right the skin the muscles the bones you have layers there's no way you can deny that you have layers your spiritual layers are some of the most exciting so people who have a lot of emotions down here probably going to be magnified in heaven your personality gets magnified in heaven yes the jokes are better okay number one there's nothing defiling nothing breaking nothing evil nothing that anybody couldn't see the movies are all clean the jokes are clean stay clean it's heaven most exciting intense beautiful amazing that would wonder and splendor and creatures you've never even seen before are there but he made you layer for different reasons okay so when this layer that you're wearing right now sleeps or like i said it's melted down or whatever happens to it's going to be okay god got it okay he's got that thing so yeah make sure you get cremated it's cheaper i meant people said i'm on i want to give my family member a funeral but would have been seventy thousand dollars of what i had to create it for seven months they're probably happy you did that because guess what we're all going to be back say we'll all be back we get our bodies back they will be young they will be timeless timeless there's no time in heaven everyone is young time doesn't go by okay it comes from god time comes from the father he's in charge of time okay he does things in heaven by events say by events on god's timeline it's whatever event is on there is what's happening there's an event right now it's not send jesus to get the people on the rapture rug that's not what's on there that's way way down way away okay say beginning of time i could draw a timeline all the way down to here [Music] we still have all of this left at least several hundred years maybe more i might still be here amen y'all want to be here during all that time yes are you sure about that no i am i've not been given an option when i said yes to do this and my family knows they already know i'll be here when they're gone their kids are gone their grandkids are going the great friends i'll still be here i'll make them some brownies because he chose me for that and i said yes you know john could have still been here say john that beloved the one who jesus loved will be very scriptural could have remained and be here right now if he chose that god's not a respecter you just have to say yes and you have to be willing yes is nice willing is better willing and obedient is what he needs okay for people who have commissions like that and that's not even my gift my gift i as you look at me i am a photographer my passion that i'd rather do 24 hours a day if i could would be photography i create moments in time that's how i look at it i don't just take a picture there is no taking picture if you take pictures around me i will correct you hold the camera up get the light on it before you bring it down if you stand there you're gonna have a shadow and all those things are outlined when i travel and speak overseas people always want to take pictures what's got a picture of the castle all their 15 friends are lined up you see the top of the castle if i can help you please if you all will stand like this leave a space for the castle then like this you'll all be in it but you can see the castle because this is what you take a picture of right now so that's what i am i was sent from god in my soul photographer when i go to heaven i'll have my own studio please come it'll be for free which is a joke because nothing costs anything anyway i will for sure have a studio because i know whatever gift he made you is what you would do in heaven is what you love the most that's how heaven uprights that's why there's so many things to do in heaven does that make sense to your head well most people thought we would just be worshipping you never stop because when you see all the things he made for you you will worship in the middle of the street anywhere everywhere you start shouting praises to god because he remembered all the things that you love amen there'll be pictures of some of your family members in your mansion and right now they take pictures that you if you lost if they were burned up in a fighter they'll be in your mountain on the wall it's one of the things he does i know i saw somebody's mansion and i saw siblings they have right now and i saw other ones like probably maybe i don't know 10 11 12 something like that they weren't even born yet and i know how many siblings this other person will have so people's mountains will be quite a delight to you your crowning room is massive because you get more than one crown [Music] he gives them out say he gives them out at one time we will throw a specific one we're not going to throw all of them at him we bury him maybe i don't know it's okay to laugh you need to know that humor is one of the number one things in heaven there is peace people go well peace be with them they die don't even rest in the arms of jesus they're not resting [Music] they're riding a roller coaster they're eating desserts somewhere because jesus loves desserts honey was his number one thing he ate while he was on the earth and guess what his cousin ate it too right what did johnny where's the last thing say it loud his family was hooked on honey jesus loved honey we made that that feast for them on the shore fish and it was honey he loves honey guess what he still loves me i have a jar in my pantry that says this is for jesus if he shows up i'm ready and to make this whole thing even funnier people don't think they'll laugh sometimes you laugh or cry when i talk about it sometimes you just don't know what to say because your your natural brains like blanked out a long time ago it's going to be in the ground anyway or where else it ever is but but i was the person in the family of 15 who wanted to number one be alone in a family of 14 siblings i always wanted to be alone was that ever going to happen do you think it was ever going to be about me say no really loud i wanted to be alone and i didn't care if anybody knew who i was i don't know if they knew my name i didn't want to hug anyone i didn't want to hug anybody that won't be kissed don't go to italy unless you want to be kissed if you go to a meeting 500 people you're going to get a thousand kisses because they don't just kiss you once they kiss you on both cheeks kiss kiss kiss kiss by these 400 people they had four four meetings they're making so much for my life so i want to be alone right i didn't want to be hugged or kissed i didn't want anyone to know me i knew two people and all of the schools i attended all three of my schools i knew two people that was it i wasn't seeking for people i was never part of a clique i was probably better off i wasn't a part of any of the crimes and other stuff i never got into that stuff because number one remember i could see i saw the demons around it you didn't have to ask me what hell was involved in heaven was i could see it so i didn't want any of that so here i am just wanted to be left alone that that wasn't going to happen in my life first of all i had to give myself to my family i was always on my parents side that made you unpopular had 150 pets to take care of the person we learned in the bible was how to do a funeral we sent every one of our pets to heaven don't argue with me about that i saw them there like every pet we ever have is in heaven my dad has him on his ranch every time he's someone i hear these words from my father in heaven he gets another one that was my dad's favorite words it was whatever he said about anything he he eat gas he gave himself to the world he loved his enemies literally he loved his enemies it ticked him off he loved everybody dragged him in our house got him a bed on the floor somewhere fed them found them jobs got them clothes helped them get a house that was my dad's part in the world was to be the love of god my brother rj said he was meant to kill wicked people we only did one meeting if you never met my brother rj you should search for someone yeah my brother despises injustice if he ever was a warrior he's the warrior he is the word he lives out in the wilderness away from everybody so he doesn't kill you know half the harvest before they get saved but he won't take down people who call the police i found the criminal you've been looking forward such as there he is already dad but they all know him so you know he's not going to hurt anyone that that didn't deserve it that's what he says our one meeting began together he let me go first and i was just talking about the love of god in heaven and everything then he gives her that high i'm rjs she was uh she was created by god she loved people i'm created to kill him it's a wicked this is the funny thing we were in a block church because almost no white pastors that time would invite me i might tell you something they weren't threatened by me because you know their whole culture they already had heaven culture right yeah and i have a lot about 50 000 black friends i love them all right and they might guess what righteousness truth they want all that they do again the line drawing news that's what god calls him the lion crying news but anyway so that's what he said i'm created to kill people who would take her out or kill people who are wicked and evil and belong to the devil he gets locked on death row he's about my height to minister to people who are about to be taken out yeah and he won't not look down he will not look down most people won't even go there's like three levels of bars between you and the people he'll walk up to the closest bars he can get to put his face right there and stare a hole in him and he move his eyes he'll just sit there and then they'll go like this who do you serve i started the living god of heaven on earth you made you carried you before you he gave you commission said he earth to bring life to people not to hurt them you need to know jesus christ because i know what hell looks like too and you'll burn forever and you won't like it they don't know what to do with him right he goes and gets all these prisoners one to jesus christ he won't back down he's certainly not back now and i won't tell you what he wants to do to those people in the barbed wire in dc so my siblings are very different from each other i learned to love everybody no matter where you're from where you're at you know i can honestly say i love you because god in me loves you so our job here is to love to share the truth right you don't have to force people to get saved you can't do that anyway it has to be a decision in here right and make a decision we just water it you know and share and then water it somebody else water then somebody wins them to jesus christ holy spirit draws them say holy spirit draws them it would be much harder with that holy spirit on the earth okay that's why he was sent way back in jesus time it wasn't easy to live that either but easy to live in the beginning right after jesus left but it certainly is different now and you were made by god very specific when he sent you he wrote words on the will on your will wrote on your actual will sometimes i can see him on people's will because i'm a seer i see spiritual things he wrote words of what he wanted you to be what he created you to be in the earth that book she writes every day of your life in you're in a book that's there you get it when you go to heaven this is what he intended for you this is what he purposed for you but sometimes the enemy got you off track sometimes wicked people did things he didn't intent and he he that was not his purpose he created the earth so he could take you from him where you live and when the time of conception comes holy spirit takes your little spiritual being and knits you together to that dot of flesh that's i knit you together in your mother's womb that's not putting your arms and legs down this nobody on this earth can do this spiritual thing nobody can even know where your spiritual being is the spirit of life talked about the bible was you you wrote in and out on the rays of the rainbow from the father they still do send me i want to i want to love people to send me i want to go to earth for you they'll say that to the father all the time that's what you did you played in the river of life inside him he jumped on the stones and fired a massive gemstones burning with his passion that's where everyone here came from everyone who's on the earth came from that place the father carries you in him in him we live we move we have our being the prophets and poets of the old have spoken of these things that means they will show that it reveals them where they came from everyone no matter what they believe or where they're at right now in this world came from him he is our father we are his offspring his heart is that you know him that you love him that you receive his son so you can be with him in heaven because jesus is the way back to the father and when anyone dies and they are caught up to heaven jesus meets you he walks you up the steps of the throne and says to his father here i have brought them home to you is part of his reward for dying for us he knows everything about you still loves you still wants you has purpose for your life here this is the thing about the babies this is awesome every baby when every baby was sent he wrote on their wills and by the way he wrote whether they were male or female yeah some other group can't teach anybody that i know they'd like to do that too by the way they wrote that on some piece of paper somewhere he wrote in here and when people try to be some other thing that they're not they have great conflict in their soul their soul fights against them because their soul already knows if you're male or female let alone what your body is saying to you they know that's what they were meant to be and i have talked to many people who switched that and have switched back and would all tell me the same thing i had conflict all the time in my soul it would fight and say no that's not you that is not you that's not how you were made you're meant to be i will tell you this there is going to be in one of these of god millions of homosexuals will get born again like like in a sudden a way and if they had operations they get their stuff put back on yeah talk about a sign and a wonder right here he's going to do it he's going to do that because he made us very specifically he made us detailed our personalities are different your personality is still different in heaven you're just nicer if you weren't nice down here you laugh and control me and you won't get to stop it either this place isn't heaven they go just for the laughter okay waves of it come out of places and hit you and just roll on the ground you never did that get used to it practice maybe then i saw a spot i was one of those people that didn't laugh i was so serious i was serious serious with the capital s i was serious i was serious i wanted everything to be done right that was me you know when my mom knew she left me the house would still be burning and not be burnt down that i'd know where everybody was and they'd be okay they may not be happy with me but but that was my assignment to keep everybody together and keep them safe and i i made like 10 sandwiches every day for their lunch and helped them with homework at night then if i was they were sick i've got to pray for them and sit with them until they were better and this was my life this was my life like young my life and i didn't say no to my parents i honored my mother and my father i get to do this now i get to have pink hair which was ordered by heaven okay i get to eat cake i still have to watch how much i eat okay i celebrate all the time because i already know i know what my end is i also pretty much know what your end is and it's because i'm willing have been taken back in the past and shown how things happen so i can give revelation taken forward in the future i've had glimpses of the new earth and all the other worlds around it i've seen father son holy spirit seven spirits of god melchizedek who is the father's high priest and always has been he has always had flesh on him i'm going to really mess with your mind now now has always had flesh before god made flesh on people on the earth he's really neat looking he serves the father at the obedience of the father he came to the earth became the king of salem collected tithes from abraham that's why he could see him he's also the one who's oh head of the tribe of angels that there's a whole tribe of angels that god put flesh on so you can send them to the earth as watch your angels not all of them fell everybody says oh my god not all of them some did some did not they have flush that's why they can make offspring i hope your answers are getting given okay but melchizedek still serves the father that's his position personal high priest to the living god the seven spirits of god also serve god they serve him they are his that means they serve him that doesn't mean that they're his seven attributes everybody every syllabus i've ever seen okay seven spirits of god here's the syllabus and in five minutes i can tell you what it is okay how to explain the trinity some people can't they think we have a three-headed god no they have the ability to step inside of each other father you know son holy spirit holy spirit steps in the father jesus steps in the father here's the three in one and that's how he showed me helped up to heaven said i'm going to show you the three in one and they all came i said here we are father son holy spirit in a couple minutes of time if there was time i understood what people have tried to figure out for years when he said jesus said father me and you when you and me he literally meant me inside you and you inside me and when they began to create before there was anything there was heaven the father's house there's nothing but the spirits around the father would step up where there's nothing he would speak physical realm jesus stepped out of him he was called the word stepped out and a drop of water in his hand he stretched it into a canvas and he wrapped it around just like this a huge part of the spirit realm and we created the physical round and then he began to hang the planets on there anything visible he couldn't hang physical things on a spiritual thing that's why spirits can walk through this physical wall because the original realm supersedes this physical realm which is temporal that's how he did it and from that moment they began to create everything in the physical realm we created the planets they didn't make the sun in the moon yet because the first earth when he made it the first time was lit with his glory millions of years between verse one mercy millions millions say millions i hope that messes up your mind too you know who doesn't mess it up it doesn't mess up scientists they ask the uh i'm not going to say astrological the astronomy people already have an understanding that this earth is well well over millions and millions and millions and millions of years old those who dig in the dirt and find the dinosaurs and the layers of the earth they already understand that man man man has been here for a limited time but the earth itself has been here for a very very long time so when there's darkness covering the earth because of what happened before that right in the beginning means before there was time in the beginning was when the earth was just a thought in god's head when he made the earth it was perfect it was beautiful there was no sin in it he said to watch your angels to watch over all the creatures that were on the earth the dinosaurs roamed the earth there was a water vapor shield around the whole earth that put mist on the ears because it hadn't rained there had been no storms yet on the earth there was only one landmass and all this ocean was around it how do i know he took me back in time and showed me how he created the heavens and the earth and when i explain this to an evolutionist they want to know god because they have answers to the questions they've always had what about that footprint they found by the dinosaur that was a watcher angel who had flesh on him so his footprint was in the dirt there's no crow magnum man there were never there never was a chromatin a man okay god didn't make people that were half ape and half person and put them on the earth okay we are we didn't come from monkeys say we didn't come from monkeys say we're made in the image of god he's not a monkey the angels laugh every time they hear us every time they watch the slime pool thing every time they watch someone talk about the big bang they laugh so hard they would cry if they could [Music] because that takes a lot more faith to believe than god making us putting us here right so having this involved very much in our lives always has been involved the angels are all over in here they all your angels are here and most of mine are outside because they couldn't fit in here and god gave me promises all kinds of promises just said yes i'll do this for you however long it takes i don't care he said one day i'll open their eyes everybody will see the angels one day i'll take everybody to heaven so everybody raise always do this raise your hand up say we're ready right now take us for a trip let's see if it happens not today that may seem strange to some people but one day it will be happening the closer we get towards the end and the end for people might be the rapture but i can tell you this all the stuff in the bible is going to happen it will all happen the tribulation the perilous times it's going to happen christening on the third jerusalem is going to happen for that thousand years satan being taken off the earth during the time is going to happen he'll be back on the earth to tempt all the ones who were born people lived to be seven eight nine hundred years old during that time uh if you died at 100 that would be like a child say timelessness is coming to the earth before them yes it said that there would be a generation of people on the earth that would taste of the powers of the age to come the age to come after this age we're in is the millennial age so he's not done with this one yet it's not going to end okay but there would be people living in your time i'm saying over the next couple hundred years in this time who will be timeless will begin not to age who will travel to the spirit realm all the time rather than the physical realm who do amazing signs and wonders for him that's why he needs this time right now to clean a lot of the evil off of the earth he can't even send new inventions there's inventions that haven't happened yet that will actually make our life so much easier and so different that he won't put them here until the evil is pushed back say god is not willing to give those inventions to the wicked if you see his big picture about all this is happening you will understand why all the evil is being exposed and it's being exposed all over the world why is this happening say god's going to clean that platform off collard so we can step into the greater days of glory that's why if everything had happened is normal and there's all kinds of stuff going on we didn't know if everything had happened as normal on november 3rd then a lot of that would never be found out it wouldn't be known the evil wickedness would still be there hiding plotting and planning and god isn't going to do some things until a lot of them are taken off who understands please raise your hand if you were god and you had great things to send to the earth would you allow all that to remain and you can see just in our country alone how that has interfered you can imagine saying no holds barred for anybody easier than what you want to it would be really hard to have any of that happen right so he does have a plan it is going to we are having justice it will come not just here but around the world and there's be some people here you will see no more see there'll be people here say it wicked people who will be here no more that is his plan amen amen so you're living in different days this is all different our lives have had to be different right it's going to be worth it for what is coming that no man can stop or interfere with and your family member is going to be running to you to find out who jesus christ is there's going to be a lot of salvations happening because people number one are going to know there's a god because only god could do all what's going to be done so on god's timeline we're right there at one of his things right now on his timeline right now we're there so everybody here is born because he needs you here he wants you here okay no one is a mistake no matter how you got here or who he sent you to he never purpose evil for you or harm or tragedy so everybody's seeing enough we're going to do oh we're going to do a soul checkup and i do it for the sake of those who probably wouldn't ever do it this is available to the body of christ to be free of everything that's hindered you hurt you any tragedy anything that happened in your life that you keep having memories of maybe even nightmares about you won't have them no more if you're involved in addictions and you sincerely lose that addiction from your soul he'll come down and pull out of you amen and this is something the father taught me himself it's the first time i actually looked at my clock and then he told me that i'm going to teach you something and i looked at my clock it's all the time when i came back it was four hours later my staff had been beating on my door my daughter come over to see me and i didn't answer anybody my body was there i wasn't there he took me and showed me how he made a human soul why he mean it that way how important it is to understand the fullness of the peace of the kingdom i'm telling you about the keys of the kingdom that's what this is you call it something else he calls it a soul checkup you should do it all the time i used to teach it once and then that was nice and i found out a few weeks later no this is a lifestyle if someone says something horrible bashing hurting to you you turn around loose those words from your soul and him will go and it will be to you like they never happened if you saw traumas if you had tragedies if you lose that tragedy from your soul he'll come down and go shh it'll be like it never happened to you you can talk about it there's no hurt there's no fear there's no suffering no matter what it was you don't have to have that in you he doesn't want it in you his explanation to me was i don't have time for them to have six weeks or six months or six years of therapy i don't have that kind of time i need them free i need them free right now that's why i'm going to teach you this and if you're willing to learn it and train them then i will show you who melchizedek is you give me promises i'll do this for you and i didn't ask him i'll do this for you do this video i'll do this for you and of course you know i said yes i know you'd be the whole world i'd be training that's okay it's the most important thing you probably learn other than knowing jesus christ you can walk through your life with no pain no suffering no fear no grief no traumas no addictions now it may try to come back to you saying nope i got rid of you i'm not taking you back and the devil will try to bring back whatever he can you say nope it's gone and i've done this with too many people for you to try to tell me it doesn't work it does work so if you're a born-again believer you can do this okay so first i always start with we're all going to repent and say father father i come before your throne i come before you i love your son jesus christ i love you right now i'm going to clean up my salt right now i'm going to clean it up i repent of any sin since my original repentance i don't want any of it in me so i'm giving it back to your son i thank you jesus thank you jesus for cleansing my soul for blessing my soul that i can be free of all sin amen amen now we're going to do this soul checkup i will list things that you need to lose from your soul but if i don't say something you can say that yourself and everyone does it so nobody's going to be figured out or pointed out the one thing i will see is stuff leaving you i'ma the seer i will see jesus come down he pulls gray matter out of you that's what it looks like it looks like gray because you have the light of god but if you have darkness in there if you play with sin or play with stuff and the enemy looks in you he will see gray he will go after you he'll already go after you so that's why number one you don't want to keep it right he also doesn't want people bashing screaming yelling because you sound like hell when you do that our words are supposed to bring life yes amen we're here to bring light and love and life those three things that's why you're here so if you have anger issues there's something in your soul that keeps making you do that so you can lose anger from your soul it won't ever come back again don't go watch 10 movies with profanity in them i have to say this about profanity that is hell's language you are literally speaking the language of hell if they hear enough they're going to start showing up because they recognize those words that's why god says no profane word should come out of your mouth there it is right there no profane words should be spoken by you amen it's not in heaven no one in heaven talks like that i've been to hell three times and it was filled that's the only language they speak so we don't want to represent now we're not here for that right and i'm sure you may have good reasons to get angry or upset it says you can be angry and sin not okay don't add that to your list we're not supposed to wound people with our words so please don't bash people when people they say this when people lash out at you they're afraid fear causes people to lash out they'll never admit that they won't even think that but fear makes you lash out that's what happens and i always know that person needs help if they're bashing me they need help and so that's how i look and that's how god has taught me to look at it so we should always be here to help people if people don't like you or they're mean to you please forgive them go in a room forgive them loose all of it out of your soul whatever it is maybe teach little kids do this even little kids if they're if they're bashed at school or bullied at school you as their parent can lay your hand on their head and say as a watcher over their soul i choose to loose from my child's soul all the hateful mean ugly words that were spoken to him today i loose them in jesus name and jesus will come down and pull them out of the soul of the child and those children will act like it never happened you have the right to do that because you're the parent amen so this is something you can live do for the rest of your life when something happens immediately to you that's the best time to do it if you're in grief i understand you miss somebody but don't let that grief still be there a year two years three years five years like don't build like a memorial it's okay to put the pictures on the wall i'm saying don't go in there and reap over them all the time they're in heaven saying please have a life they're up there saying please laugh please let it go please release me some people if your parents or loved ones have died and you're still grieving you need to say these words i choose with my will to release my loved one into the hands of jesus to complete whatever destiny he has for them in heaven when you do that they will hear that in heaven number one it will make them very happy it will remove grief out of you that didn't leave yet okay you don't want a spirit of grief which doesn't go in here but will speak to you all the time about how horrible it was that they died they repeat how they die they don't think about how they died they just know one thing they're happy they're there and people got saved in the last minute are really happy they're there they made a beautiful three-level cabin on the river of wherever in heaven but they may not have a mansion the size of new york city but you know they're not upset with anyone who has something greater because those people that was a reward for their life amen so we're going to say i choose i choose as the believer in jesus christ the believer in jesus christ to lose from my soul every anger purple bashing [Music] i lose [Music] i lose that from my soul every fear every year every i'm trying to think of what the words are some natural words um they'll come in just a minute i lose any fear any oppression any depression any thoughts of suicide i loosen from my soul at least from my soul any hate any vengeance any effects and the unforgiveness and it was spoken against me that i was involved that were spoken against me out wrongfully against me i lose all of that and lose all of that from my soul from my soul jesus name i lose from my soul any pornography any pedophile any wicked defiled things that i looked at before watched they were forced for [Music] and he laughed any poverty any poverty any wealth that was stolen i forgive those people in jesus name i was not made to live i am not keeping it in jesus name can attack me in any of those ways i lose it from my soul in jesus name i lose from my soul any unrighteousness anything it took me beyond what god allows what god loves beyond the boundaries he except for us as believers i lose all that from my soul at least from my soul and he failed and he failed here any thoughts of failure any failed activities or businesses or plans or plays of the enemy he took me out of them i will not i will be associated with failure i am above i am not beneath any thoughts any thoughts of being beneath me i will not keep them against any any hurting crippling crushing controlling words that i spoke over others i boost them from my soul i lose from my soul deep sadness unfounded sadness that has no ground i will not keep that in my soul i was [Music] any deceiving words that were spoken to me or about me that i heard on the news any fake news i would lose from my soul any lies about this time any corruption that i heard spoken i use all of that i will not make judgments from that i loose it all for myself in jesus name any thoughts i've had of being unimportant and not measuring up not being what god wanted me to be those words did not come from god i will not keep those thoughts i will not keep those take them captive loosen from my soul in jesus name and we're going to wait a few minutes while he just pulls all that out and [Music] now we're going to bind the things of god to our soul this is one way you can stay happy every day of your life you choose to be happy you choose to be what god called you to be no matter what's going around you but when those things aren't in you it's much easier but if you want the fullness of god you can ask for more than just your rent being paid food on your table you know things that need to be fixed or hold us fine but he wants you to be more than that you have not because you asked not today we're going to ask to have things bound to our soul when you do that he comes and he puts them in you some of them come in waves i see whole waves of the joy of the lord whole waves of his presence whole waves of his life so we're going to who do you are you all ready to ask for them yes say i choose as an act of my will to bind to my soul my soul the love of god the love of god the life of god the light of god the presence of the lord the joy of the lord his creativity his creativity his expectations yes his validation my gift that he gave this word i will meditate on all the time all the time in jesus name i bind to my soul the goodness of god and it will be evident the life of god and it will come for me the glory of god that we are seated in christ christ in me is the hope of glory that i bind to my soul i bind to my soul his will his plan to release it to the just in the righteousness that promise my mind to my soul by him to my soul sound wisdom extreme discernment i can operate for him the way he needs to be in jesus name so be it [Applause] amen [Music] he has great plans for all of us and it doesn't depend on your age your position doesn't depend on anything but one thing you belong to his son right do you mean that decision to accept christ and his sacrifice i know a lot about things that happened the day that he died on the cross a lot about what happened from the moment his he had his spirit leave his body i think if he hadn't told him to leave he might still be there because he did he commanded the spirit mentally leave his body and his body was taken down it was placed in the tomb god appointed two angels to be with christ through many different times in his life if it said angels came and comforted him it was the same two angels that they were always with and they were with him in the garden they were chosen to bring that cup that cup is a real cup the thing he drank all the wickedness and evil and every sin and wickedness that existed he drank that that's what had to be nailed to the cross it wasn't just his physical body it's what he carried to the cross if people ask you how come jesus is the only one who can forgive sins you tell them that he's the only one to drink all of the evil of every single sin into his being and was willing to nail back to the cross and at that time he can abolish sin in our lives when we repent is the only one who's done that he's the only one who's made that sacrifice willing so he is the only one that has the power to forgive sin and he is the only way back to heaven someone else has another heaven good luck the one i saw belonged to the god of the bible his son jesus christ holy spirit so many angels millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of angels i've seen in heaven around in heaven all over the earth they belong to him amen he made them for specific purposes they're made in tribes like there's tribes of watcher angels tribes of couriers trying of scribes and then there is the army of heaven that is a whole different creature when it talks about the living creatures before the throne of god you're pretty much describing most of the army of heaven they don't look normal they don't look like human eye and they have wings whether you ever see them or not some are made out of just force i can't even explain that they they don't have any kind of shape that you can identify some have eyes some have 30 eyes some have eyes all over their body some have eyes in the front in the back some have two heads front and front i'm not going to explain that hello hello i was present when they brought a gift to my grandson when he was born and he is a carrier of the love of god and he's going to be an athlete who will win olympics and he's focused he's got two things in his life he's so focused i can't figure his brain out he can run faster than his father or anybody who's ever tried to beat him but what he will talk to you about is the love of god he was assigned these two angels who were one being and their names are passion and compassion and they're with him all the time he has other angels who are with him uh his main angel's name is flash your number one angel assigned to you is because of the gift you have mine is about 40 foot tall i've never seen him when i was a little tiny thing i could see him following me around all the time i apologize to him all the time you probably shouldn't have heard me say that i'm sorry then he grins at me sometimes he rolls his eyes at me but not often he's there to protect me to watch over me sometimes he'll bring me things from heaven and but but this grandson's angels always uh oh i know all my brain kids angels actually speak to them hi thank you for watching over them you know they're going to be going here i know you know that but just pay attention and and so yeah the one who's fast is almost the speed of light the first one is the first friends and is very creative he started making trips to him when he was three he seen my dad talk to my dad described my dad he never met my dad on the earth my dad keeps giving his favorite candies candies were around in the 50s that they don't even have anymore he's gone inside of a volcano in heaven and rode the lava hound with my dad he described cars that could drive up the side of mountains without wheels they exist in heaven i never told him about that he's been making trips now for five years and he'll just say the most surprising things come out of his mouth nobody's saying anything he could lead a service baptized so get people saved baptized in water cast demons out they have never been a trim in the public school that was probably a good thing you'd be down the principal's office all the time your son just baptized someone in the water fountain again and he would yeah and the second one is over the love of god will pray for everybody if he sees anyone limp in the store anyway he'll run up to them in jesus name be healed and the third one is a girl and she would be she will dance and sing and there will be weapons she'll be very fierce they should named her middle name fierce and i got two pages on her before she was born one whole one and a half pages of how fierce it she'll be she is fierce she runs for brothers she totally understands things from god she's for sees things here's things her passion to worship surpasses everything else she's got she's all about worship singing and dancing and now she's wanting to learn to play the violin i'm sure that will be very dangerous to hell when she does that because what you do in worship is dangerous against hell your prayers are your worship is however you do that by that's painting danger to how when you sing dance if you flag whatever it is that you do is worship you create images that are captured and taken before the throne of god so she's fierce her angel that protects her is the size of a mountain his name is rock and he's got this little tiny person that he follows around you know i every time i visit wherever they're all at i thank them all the time for watching over them and so i know their names i know what they will be one of my rewards god loves children she needs children you are not just raising a child you are shaping souls to the kingdom and i talk more about the kingdom usually than i do the actual world that's why christ came he came to tell us about the gospel of the kingdom it wasn't just about dying that's just how everything begins with you ruling and reigning in the spirit realm is what he actually has for you you rule with him because he rules we have ultimate authority in this earth over this earth over anything in this earth everything of satan has been put under our feet we have power over all say all the power of the enemy we're going to learn how to use it we are he's starting something new brand new right in the middle of all this time actually gave all the revelation about it on the day of the fake inauguration it will happen the body will learn who they are what your authorities in the spirit realm how to use that authority how to crush darkness push it back it'll be a different life to live in this world amen demons will run from you they won't try to attack you they will try to get away from you because what you carry will cause great pain to them yes the light and the glory of god is painful to the enemy that's why when it showed up in hell on the third day they were screaming their faces were melting they couldn't get away from christ fast enough that is what it's going to be like to live in this world with you so you're not unimportant you're not just a person you're not an old sinner say by grace don't ever say that again you are considered royalty in heaven your manifested sons and daughters of the most high god you are the love of jesus christ life he gave everything for you that's how much he loves you holy spirit can't wait to get to know you better he will share things with you that will probably undo your natural mind because heaven is not this world it's only a shadow earth is a shadow of what is in heaven and what he has waiting for all of us now in this life probably won't be repeated again what he starts now will continue until the end of this age and even those christians who would become christians during the tribulation will be a thorn in the flesh of satan they won't be crying they won't be hiding when it comes time it's going to be executed i've already been shown that they will be dancing in the line which would be the biggest irritation to say who finding things i'm really going to get them now they'll already know they already had trips to heaven by that time a lot of people will be uh it will be normal for people to be caught up to have many times doing greatest some of the greatest things on the earth until things begin to switch okay i cannot tell you for sure that the body will not be on this earth when that happens but i will just repeat what the word says until he that is with hell is removed the antichrist cannot appear on the earth well i can tell you what if we were all here he would be able to do nothing he is not here anywhere in the earth right now god wouldn't be starting these greater days of glory with so much power of god being seen and felt and known in the earth satan would not be able to fulfill his thing his few years his bump in the road that's what god says he gets a bump in the road he won't be able to operate that operate like that in those days people will be looking for a savior someone who can rescue them from the horrific perils times which will also be a short time they will take anybody okay so who shows up is the antichrist and he's actually going to be good for the first three and a half years to fool everybody he only does all the evil stuff the last three and a half years and he still won't get the whole world i don't know why people think he will he won't there's going to be rednecks here that will not want him that will not take satan even during the tribulation and there will be people on the earth when christ comes to sit on the thorn in jerusalem that didn't die even during that time and they will have a long time to make their decision for christ you have still have to get saved even during the time when christ is on the throne and some of those kings how about this want one in there knowing he's the son of god knowing he will actually control the weather and all these other things he will sit as king of the world and they will want in there so the satan is loosed 1 000 years later out of the pit he will have no authority or power in the earth for that 1000 years christ will have holy ruling in the earth there will be people who survive the tribulation that will live here during that time so sometimes you'll understand things sometimes you had a big picture given to you right now we still have a long way to go but at this point in history in heaven and on the earth are the greater days it's not the darker days amen i know some pastors if they don't have revelation and they don't know what's going on they always go to the end this is the tribulation everybody get ready for all this to happen it's not going to happen evil is not taking over this world right now it's actually going to be diminished for a very long time so thank you for letting me share make sure you make it tomorrow i will be talking about america i'll be wearing my red white and blue amen stand up so i can speak a blessing i'll just tell you we have stuff back there you might be interested in i almost never get to share about it but we do have some things i just sincerely want to speak a blessing over your lives if you don't come tomorrow well then i will just speak over you tonight amen raise your hands father i thank you for your children that are here tonight god who paid a price to be here their time their energy their efforts god and right now father i release to this room the healing power of jesus christ whether it is emotional whether it's physical whether it's mental in jesus name i speak wholeness to your bodies to your minds to your spirits in jesus name that you will walk out of your hole totally and completely the way he made you in jesus name and anybody watching online i release that to you also wholeness in your body wholeness in your mind wholeness in your emotions in jesus name and god i ask for specifically those who are here and those watching online god that you give a download of your wealth to each and every person here father a god that you have a desire in your heart you don't have to wait until that great transfer happens father you may show them your goodness by changing their finances in one week god i want to hear reports of the miraculous father the unexpected the suddenlies that are already starting in this world god let it happen to everyone who is present god and everyone who's watching and not because they have to know you love them but because i want you to do it for them i am willing and obedient god and i thank you for a blessing for myself that you will let every single person here experience the unexpected suddenlies from your hand in jesus name i declare it to be so and everyone said amen i receive it thank you amen

of Revelation in this in this place tonight and Lord we welcome the Angels tonight we welcome signs and wonders and miracles in this place tonight [Music] so come a Holy Spirit even now we love you we welcome you in this place thank you Jesus thank you Lord now I feel like the Holy Spirit is this gonna thicken his presence right now there's some of you who have been crying out I gotta have more I'm not satisfied I gotta have more and God has been stirring your heart he's been blowing on the coals of your heart the flames of your heart to ignite it into a mighty blaze and so lo let tonight be that night why wouldn't he do it tonight [Music] Jesus said blessed are the hungry are you guys hungry tonight yeah blessed are those who hunger and thirst come on how many want to be blessed tonight we've got a hunger and thirst for him and for his righteousness and you'll be filled and so Lord fill us tonight we pray or we want to step out of the natural into the supernatural realms of the kingdom of God into that place where all things are possible tonight we pray thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen well welcome good to have you I think we're gonna receive an offering right now if we are the ushers ready so we're gonna receive an offering when a hundred percent goes to Kat Kerr ministries and if you if you're making a check make it to the healing rooms and also if you need use a credit card you could just raise your hand or if you need an envelope we'll give you an envelope for tax purposes just raise your hand so we you get many ways you can give tonight well I don't know about you but I'm really expecting it's been a great day today so far and we haven't seen anything yet and so again we want to welcome you to the Healing Rooms Apostolic Center and you know I I just I always say this because it happens almost every time we meet together you just may be healed it happens in the glory here all the time we have so many angels here on assignment and I just I just got a feeling some of New York and just going to get healed you know a lot of times it happens during worship happens during the word and so we definitely haven't opened heaven and this is a place where miracles happen so when you feel the presence of the Lord we like to say it like this just reach out reach out and touch him and receive your miracle tonight all right it's been excited we were living in supernatural times and this has been a supernatural week I'm sure every here knows that Paul Kane went to be with the Lord last Tuesday evening and today was the afternoon when his body was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just different the signs and wonders happening throughout the week and and so I know that we're in the midst but we're always in the midst of the supernatural but it just seems like something special and so we invited Kat a while ago and of course nobody but God knew that Paul was gonna go home and actually be buried on the first day when she's speaking and I know that it's not a coincidence I don't know exactly what it means maybe she does but I know stuff like that is not just a coincidence so we're really blessed and honored Kat to have you here again and I'm sure how many of you have never been in a live cat care meeting Oh a lot of you good you're in for a treat so why don't you can make your way up Kat you need to come up around this way and yeah you ready oh and while she's coming up somebody dropped their glasses so if that's you you probably can't see but here they are when I put them up here so Kat um well brought those in you don't know the Lord's been taking her to heaven for several years and showing her things and bringing her back and allowing her to share with us so let's just welcome cat Kirk [Applause] Wow [Applause] I know some people know why I'm saying that some may not when the army of heaven goes to battle against the darkness that is their war cry why because they're excited you're gonna crush the enemy's plans over you right they're gonna crush them they're gonna pull down strongholds that have been rising against you that's why they were created news flash from heaven they weren't created to protect heaven they were made by the creator of heaven they didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third of the angels out then you get to do that Michael hell them and the Father sent a lightning bolt a million megawatts of love from himself and took him out and then one third of angels went out the same way so they've been waiting a long time to war on our behalf full time amen I may or may not give you scripture for that tonight go look it up I think most of us know that Jesus was the lord of state loud the host is the name of the army of heaven yes they're still part of the angel tribes but they're different in many ways the ones under Gabriel have many different positions and jobs in heaven and on the earth and they look more like us they're the ones who look more like us the army of heaven mostly does not look anything like us they're creatures most of them are creatures they're fierce looking they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps so what the Holy Spirit says they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps however there was one time when they had to take the place of the worship angels which were the one-third that were kicked out the only ones Lucifer got were the ones he was over he was over one-third of the angels was the worship angels obviously if he was the one who led them in worship all the time in heaven I'm just gonna give you full out Revelation because I want to take advantage of all the time I have so if you didn't know this he used to step inside God to lead worship he covered over the very heart of God with his wings which were embellished with gems he had gems on his back on his front people go well he had just a few no he had really hundreds of them on him and when God made him he made mountings like in a ring and every gem was mounted and amounting like a ring that you would wear like this one here and he was beautiful which is one of the reasons why he ended up by falling from pride from his beauty also he thought he was smarter than God and that was a that was busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz you're gonna laugh a lot tonight alright heaven laughs every time the devil loses down here all of heaven roars yes they know what's going on and today they were attendants for Paul Cain with Paul Cain not talking about the body talk about his spirit man everyone gets to see their own homecoming isn't that nice so we're colors and play lots of music and dance because that's what they'll be doing in heaven news flash from heaven number two they don't have a funeral in heaven when you come home say Amen you shouldn't expect one we should have a party zone down here when we send people off instead of a funeral home someone opened a party zone I promise you'll make more money than other people with funeral homes cuz even the world will want to send theirs off wherever they think they're going they'll pick a party anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea I've been giving up for years I don't think anybody's done it yet so there you go the more real heaven becomes to the body of people will want to send them off with a real celebration because of the reality of what heaven is and what they're going to be experiencing there it won't make sense to have a sad funeral while they're watching from the party I'm a seer that means I see in the unseen realm okay mister I'm really happy Danny because I got to experience all that heaven was doing and what was going on with Paul Kane and his mother and his sisters you know his family that's up there and the others who were attending up there watching his service he enjoyed every funny thing that was told he likes to be real so he liked all the reality of who he was he liked that personal side of him being talked about so next time you plan a family members homegoing service tell some jokes because they will laugh I was at a service one time and back home and it was um trying to member the guys name I remember told McClellan he was part of story side B and he died suddenly and I came into his service I didn't know anyone but I was coming to bring some books about heaven to his family the Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him watching from the portal that was really difficult you know to try to pretend to be sad and I never wear black it's okay if you if you go to somewhere where they're expecting you know to do what is proper not to upset them but no one's wearing black in heaven they're not and they aren't having to partying there was I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what I don't know you know helps my human head lots of times because they kind of took that away from me I used to be kind of brilliant really then they made me like eight years old life is much easier being that way you know what you don't worry about things you don't think about what's gonna happen five years down the road when you don't even know or you already planned you know prepare for disasters or something I never got that really if we're over the weather then we shouldn't be concerned about the weather we rule over it amen okay she didn't know news bulletins number three writes number three are you keeping track you're gonna get a gift number three Jesus was over the weather we are joint ears we get to be over the weather and that great you're gonna see that more and more I'm serious you're gonna see it more and more things stop like stop can't wait for that to happen meteorologists might have to get another job not making fake news by the way they don't work now and it's not gonna work when it's not actually happening what was I talking about number three boys over over the weather Jesus was over the weather and he tried so hard to teach his disciples he really was in case you didn't know they were in boot camp with him for three years it wasn't just watch what I do it's learn what I do and then do it right he was gonna go he's gonna go back for some R&R and he had to make sure they understood how this whole thing works being a joint heir with Christ what do you have we have he said so himself the things I did how point-blank can you get the things and the works I have done you will do well you forgot the first part you will do also okay these are just the works you got to do the works say we got to do the works then we get to do the greater say it louder okay like you're excited well I don't just try things I actually do them there's a difference I'm just gonna try that means you're not making much of a plan about that right but doing it the works I did you will do they do also and greater works you will do I think that means we're socially doing something we're entering into a busy season a busy season operating in the supernatural not just talking about it a busy season handling the wealth of the wicked not just talking about it a busy season living not just existing doing the more say the more the more is amazing are you getting better I am just as passionate about living holy as I am about being funny and I will tell you I I have to I have to give you both sides of heaven there's two sides in heaven there's holy profound the other whole half of heaven is funny say funny everybody have they've thought for ever and for ages that it would be boring in heaven maybe because all they do is worship let me tell you you stand in front of him it's not boring whether you're staring feeling like you're going to faint melting to the ground you know you feel like you don't have breath in you because of just being near him yeah it is an honor a privilege and amazing when you worship and it's not normal not even worship as normal in heaven you ride on it you create things as you're worshiping him you're creating when you worship given the devil a big black eye and a very bad day when you worship Him you are shredding bashing and crushing his fake little wannabe Kingdom in the second heaven when you worship Him it's amazing from doing one thing for him to honor him to bless him to adore him what destruction you do against the kingdom of darkness that's my favorite second thing I don't do demons I do do Jesus though I love him I honor him I can't do anything without him it's because of him and with him and it is his plan even the pink hair is his plan because he's not boring there's nothing boring about him there's absolutely nothing boring about heaven there's nothing boring about our future that's like in the next few days the more you believe things are real the more real they will become and that is actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit realm truth the more you believe it is real and talk about it being real and write about it being real and actually acting in it being real the more real it's going to become to you it's the original realm it's the eternal realm it's not the temporary realm this is a temporary life for you it's a temporary place to live a temporary to do things because this earth is not eternal I know people have worked it out in their own mind with their head research and they're looking up stuff and sometimes assuming because I've read a lot of translations and someone kind of miss it I know because the Holy Spirit shows me those scriptures then he'll show me 30 scriptures of it being translated I take the word for the value it gives it's real it is for us to repair us to accelerate us to propel us into high places you never dreamed of doing things you never dreamed of we are living examples of the Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth that's why you're here you here to be like them look like them and act like them I don't see any failure in any of that I don't see hopelessness worthlessness I don't see fear at all one of the first things the Holy Spirit gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what we decided to call him there's so many we don't know what to call and we didn't just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a Kingdom quote was don't let fear interfere that was a good one right teach me never to fear never say never at all in any way fear does not control our life we do not partner with fear he didn't put fear in us when he made us we're supposed to be fearless and timeless everybody should be yelling I receive it say timeless we're supposed to be timeless he said you had to die I'm being serious not funny now serious John didn't have to die did he say no didn't Jesus say to the disciples what is it so in other words he's saying it doesn't matter what they think you probably actually said that he's a character he's the son of God but he is a character the problem with the biggest characters in heaven except for Holy Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by that much who they called the drama King Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit is a drama King you haven't only seen just a little bit of his activity so far waiting to the full fledge release on this earth he's excited he's excited about what's about to happen in us they've been waiting a long time say they've been waiting a long time if I say the word day I mean the Trinity they're not boring none of them they know how to step inside of each other and be one one thing that's how it happens I know I was eight years old father caught me up before the throne and said I'm going to show you how the three can be one and a five-year-old can understand that man's head knowledge has expanded it and expanded it and all kind of could use every other kind of word explaining that you know multiply it whatever you want to call it made it look amazing powerful and hard to understand it's simple they can step inside of each other Jesus said father I pray that one day that they be one even as we are one because he steps inside his father all the time when he was the word he did the same thing I didn't forget I was only on number three bulletins by the way I've got some more I was the least likely person to anyone on this earth would have chosen to do this okay I'm from a tribe like a real one 15 people in an alligator and an iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs and lizards and spiders we grew up with them in our home I had seven brothers what did you think in Florida you add that up that's what that comes to sell your bike to some kid for a pig bring him home wrap him up and close and you have a new pet overnight we never knew what was going to be in our home so I didn't need anyone's opinions I was never part of a group or a clique I had a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a dead person standing before you dead people are wonderful for God to use they're not full of self they don't have their own opinion and the devil cannot use a dead person the more dead you are to yourself the more dangerous you are against hell there are many ways to kill me before I even grew up and you know it doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in this room I loved all my siblings I survived I conquered I was a leader wasn't liked all the time but I was a big help to my parents I honor my parents greatly every day of my life I loved them I didn't want to hurt them they needed help say parents they need help pastors they need more help I'm grateful people can start a church Oh No I've already died I don't need a church I don't need a whole congregations of people although I love them I bless you all but I really bless the pastor because they die every day to be that amen you'll notice that God didn't actually send his son to be a pastor did you ever notice that they actually sent him as a businessman God loves business people they're easy they know how to listen they know how to complete things that are given to them they don't leave things out forget things ignore things they do a job amen so he sent his son as a businessman who could easily connect with the sinners and he did they ate with him all the time they liked him he was exciting he was interesting he was funny his favorite job was to offend the hierarchy he was good at it and yet lived holy did miracles raise the dead they took money from people for spotted lambs they weren't high on God's list and he had to train his disciples I know he only had him for three years and I think most of them finally got it after he left but they did give him credit they did but in the beginning I'm sure Jesus would go to the Father when he went to the mountain all the time and say are you sure I have to that fight all the time they brawl over women I have one who wants to be everything until everybody that that would be Peter I have a treasure you know that cheats all the time right you know that you know he takes money all the time I know you know that too and I have a tax collector and every time you walk down the road to go Minister we get stones thrown at us because they don't like him I don't know anybody who likes tax clusters they didn't back then either so he did not give him the best or the easiest to Train and I know I was saying something to God about my some of my staff and he said I didn't make it easy for my son in my conversation ended with that subject especially when he caught me up me took me back and I got to walk through a whole day of their lives like in their first year of being together all right God I can make it God has a plan for you every single person is important to him and I do know this your birth was timed on this earth God created time he knew you before you were born because you played inside of him he saw you if there was time he saw you all the time how great is see that he was huge he could make himself as big as he wanted to and he walked on the mountains he was out where there was nothing and he spoke and the world would step out of him and make space that God would make himself small enough to step inside himself and play with you he did say he's not a man he's God and even being that great he knew everything about you knew the mistakes knew our faults knew everything that had great hope and great plans for you to do great things so it's no mistake you're here now in this age instead of the ages before this time you're here right on time for the accelerator time for the more of God for the kingdom age for the time to command the hosts of heaven handle the wealth by host cities for him to use because he's not poor he knows the names of your children that you'll have even before you get married he knows them and he put them in your family line on purpose in this generation that's here now this is a special generation for God it's the beginning of the group and type of people that will remain until all things be fulfilled some well the Bible says there'll be a group of people like that a group and type of people a generation that we're generation means a group and type of people it doesn't mean like 30 years or actually that word in the Bible that says Jesus says that there'll be a group and Type O people on earth that will be here when all things be fulfilled including the coming of him that word means a group and type of people that work generation means that there will be a grouping type of people on this earth that also says in the Bible that would taste of the powers say powers of the age to come that would be the Millennial age of course there's people now let's say they're not going to be in millennium I go about what the Bible says there will be a millennium there will be a Tribulation God caused a bump in the road it will happen that's on his timeline in heaven so no matter what other people have come come up with or assume or have putting in translations I promise you it's going to happen and you can't make it happen or not happen anyway so to me it's not worth agreeing over God's gonna work out his plan all the way to the end right I'm excited to know that I'm part of that generation that will tasted the powers of the age to come that's why you need revelation because that that all that comes from the heart of God he already knows what it's going to look like she knows what's gonna happen so he chose you to be here to be a part say Amen that word means so be yet might as well say it gonna happen there's no one on the earth in the earth around the earth say it's round I gotta say that the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so that's him say the earth is round not flat they don't have edges you may say that property does not have edges there you go Holy Spirit truck can we use proper grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it there is a whole group of people that sincerely spend so much time and money to try to prove the earth is flat I'd rather use that money in that time and energy ruling right I've flown many times and I didn't get halfway around the world then all of a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait shh now you're on the other side no I went around besides I've already been up over the earth it's round God made it round he says he sits on the circle of the earth not the square you'd be surprised how serious they are they think NASA has spent billions of dollars faking it and none of that stuff is real I don't know who got that thought but it didn't come from heaven a man so just rest assured that it's around okay been there seen that it is round and when I almost shown it God caught me up in space up and do like like first space not I've been way up there but the first time he caught me up and showed me the earth he put a grid you know like a grid you know what that is yeah a grid was round and he put it right on the earth cheol-ho together and then they begin to draw things on this grid that was his plan that was called space planning that was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out in space put the grid than planned right uses every opportunity to be funny so he did show me his space planning for like the next hundred years that was probably 15 20 years ago when he showed me that that doesn't mean the earth is going to end in a hundred years except been taken further than that and no tribulation had happened I know some people think it's supposed to be right now well if it was it would be people get to heaven they all find out man we wasted so much time sitting on our rapture rug she to roll it up put it in the closet well you've you've been around a long time you realize I went to church everyday it was open and every day someone said Jesus could come tomorrow and in my I'm like little this is like little I had these thoughts why would he have all these plans in the Bible and go okay not forget that we're just all going home I mean he gave my dad a long plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him a long plan I mean he's not going to where we haven't done what God told us to do yet and God said well many people are in fear and they know one day that will happen so they want it to come so to them that's logical they don't understand a lot especially in the book of Revelation say revelations means revelations that means something you don't know so God said I'm calling you a Revelator me you know why he did that so people couldn't call me a false prophet they don't know what a Revelator is so they didn't never say nothing against it they couldn't say well she's not a terrible pastor no he can't call an evangelist she doesn't go out and win lots of millions we can't call her that huh can't call her prophet she's a Revelator don't know what that is so we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is someone who reveals like John did caught up showing the future the future no know what that was that was a bling glitch write that down and don't forget it I know Jen is writing it down right now if I say word she goes you did a bling glitch that means you blended some words together okay I won't explain it yes you've been there I'm sure people been there right you've been there well at least I'm not talking about noses putting the animals on the art tonight that's Moses and Noah doing it together when Donna even said Adam did it I did hear from people I have a bloopers thing one day and just put them all on there go there and look at it but now I forget we're talking about who is listening Revelator you're right so see I hear them all the time I have to fight when you're eight you need help so he didn't pick me to be a professor you know I was graduated middle of my class like literally middle we had six hundred graduating students we have a lot of people coming to Florida to go to school I guess they like it we're pretty laid-back there you know and so it's a nice place to live if you want to come live someplace different go good vacation time try not to come in August really hot so being a Revelator's a little bit different that usually doesn't mean profit just so you've wondered you know John was a men and it's okay I love doing that but I love being with my father my heavenly father him all the time I know why Jesus loved him so much I know why he wanted to be with him I know why he went away to the mountain to spend time with him I know how hard it was for him to leave home and come here okay he was not poor he didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor he became poor when he left heaven because heaven is certainly not poor there's nothing poor up there nothing splendor and wandering beauty you couldn't afford to build the house that you're mentioned that your mother lives in you wouldn't even have the right substances to make it the walls sing literally they sing they leave you go on tours come back they sing hello to them the trees uproot their self and they come and sit in your house and be your friend for a while they'll go back to the friendly forest is this ok it's not gonna be normal no you can't be normal you've been going to heaven for 20 years you be normal to heaven they tell funny stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped most people when they go there no matter how they were here they're all happy they love jokes they love to tell funny stories hear funny stories they love it they make plans for people before they come they knew Paul was coming they all knew Paul is coming there's a place you go in heaven where you find that out and you go in this beautiful amazing building and these supernatural monitors much better than ours but these are good and you can see who's coming home who's about to come home to heaven everybody starts getting things ready they're so excited they're there beside their self they want to make sure they're all there say all to meet you at the gate they have a huge celebration they plan one themselves heaven plans one the throne room plans one people have celebrations in the street over someone coming home stay home it's because that's where you came from we were alone to the earth for a while when you go home you are really home and you're not dead they don't throw parties for people who aren't alive they have huge celebrations lots of music lots of food everyone meeting one another visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't taking you himself sometimes he does take people he comes into his own chariot flaming horses picks you up and takes you up to heaven then when you get out you see the sea or the mass of people waiting to greet you and then Jesus walks you up the steps of the throne to give you back to the Father and then the father reaches out of that glory that moves in and out of him the Living colors of the bow coming in and out his eyes flames of fire passion for you just glowing and he reaches his arms out and grabs you he says welcome home my son welcome home my daughter you go home as his children say we are his offspring every morning gets their own mansion you don't have to share it with your brother or sister I'll have my own one day it's made exactly the way you would love it but it's made with his presence in the walls and the floors and it's not gonna be a normal shape trust me it's not all your pets to be there they'll be waiting to greet you eating your food at your table your family members will all have gifts for you for every year you've been apart they will get a gift that represents that year and put it in your mansion after your welcome home party in the throne room which could last for quite a while your family will come get you and take you to your own mansion then they'll have another celebration everybody laughs and filled with joy to see all the ones they loved before little tiny babies they never got to raise they get their children given to them to raise the same one that you that didn't make it all the way through amen God keeps them they live with your grandparents or whoever when they get there they'll go get them and help raise them for a while I love the story of a mother they lost their son he was either 7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of course they they grieved over him but knew he was in heaven and I think it was like 20 years later or 30 years later one of the other huh she died on the operating table and was caught up to heaven saw her seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom you're here this is so exciting your mom I'm so glad you're here and you cuz what have you been doing goes I've been playing with my friends what you think I've been doing he's been living with his grandfather and playing with all these friends and the streets to go they were playing and he was laughing and he said but you can't come yet because it's not your time and so she came back never forgot it and her and her husband went around the world talking about it you will be known as you are known except you look better like a whole lot better you'll have hair most guys wear their hair about down to their shoulders don't have you know that's gonna change y'all I'm just letting you know I can't change guys unless you really want like a buzz cut or something no Marine Corps or my husband may still have one I would might be surprised to see him alive yeah he's still with me by the way another way to kill me but that was okay it's all worth everything it's worth it all no matter what you surrender give up miss doing it's worth it and you'll be so happy when you stand before God and you're welcomed home knowing that you gave everything you could not saying you have to walk around poor okay that was the devil's plan not God's his plan is to bless us say bless us and prosper us it'll be worth it some people have already seen Jesus here right how many people have seen Jesus let me see either in a vision or dream or in reality if you've seen him how many people have been encountered an angel there's usually a lot there's a lot of people here it's going to happen that's part of the acceleration that's part of the more it's a lot of them more actually that we will see angels and they will probably be talking to us they came from God ignore what we've all been told our whole lives don't talk to angels they did in the Bible amen there's gonna be a lot more of that angelic not just visitation because what we're going to experience is the habitation heavens not coming for a visit a heaven is not coming for a visit they're coming for a habitation you're part of the habitation you are all of you sitting here say I'm alive and breathing I'm part of the habitation but God is about to do on this earth does not just take a territory here and there what the habitation will be is in us say in us that's the part of the habitation that's why me and won't be able to control it like they have in the past say God will be in charge it's a habitation and it will remain for a long time he's gonna transform this world right now he is shifting government so he can shape Nations it's part of the platform he's giving us in the habitation he's got platforms for us that's the place that we will operate from and speak from shake things cause things to be released to change for him it's not a lot of how it's always been in the past that's why it's a new thing say a new thing it's time for the new thing it's where we will be ruling it's one of the purposes that Christ died for us that's why he went into hell and wasted it took back the authority and Dominion the Adam had given away he gave it to us he also gave his power over all the power of the enemy say we have power over all the power of the enemy say he did not give that to the Angels that's why we need to command them they can't just go tear up any demon they see they just can't do that they do it in in the past it was from answers to prayer and prayers never going to go away it's never gonna go away he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's gonna get even more powerful especially when you command part of an army of heaven and they pull down strongholds for you and crush the plains of darkness we need this say we need it to rule in this day say every King gets the Kingdom and gets an army if we're part of the kingdom we get part of the army did you ever see a king a natural King on this earth title rule with that one they wouldn't go very far with a they'd be overrun beaten up things stolen things killed someone's like the devil he comes to kill steal and destroy that's what the army prevents heavens army was designed created and made every one of them unique and different but they are fierce they have one job the ones under Gabriel have many different jobs many different positions to do many different things but but Michael is over one specific part and that is the army they have a headquarters they have barracks they have training fields they're all in the sky of heaven Rand maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus would go send up Michael to gather the army from the far ends of heaven to fight on behalf of Israel people say Amen it's in the Bible go read it sometimes they even fought the flesh did you know that yeah some of them could fight the flesh in this time on earth it's mostly battles in the spirit battling the demonic even those in the high places the principalities and the powers the things the beings in wickedness in high places many of those high places will be shredded and pulled down say our weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds that's one of the things the army does I can only share what I have been told and I can only tell you what I have been shown shown and told that's what I talk about but they didn't just show me things and tell me things I had to live it every way something mom is trained in it was for the body of Christ so I had to live it to let you know it's real and it really does work she follow heavens protocol see on earth as it is in heaven that's what we've been asking for for generations we should have expected it jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told me is it I knew if I taught them that and said you say that eventually it would come you mean one thing I could get them to agree on no matter what denomination they rod to clear that prayer because they need us to call things in is that right you have not because you ask not if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give you anything you want no matter what it is where it is what time it is I give you permission to use me as anyone ever says something like that let me see your hands well I'll get ready because he's calling in those words yes it's gonna be amazing say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna be amazing here we can live on earth like they live in heaven which is mainly his will being done his way say his way not our way that's part of the more she's gonna do new thing he goes revelation and then ways for you to use that revelation it means a lot of things are gonna change so if you're stuck in your own mind or your own mindset of what you think is gonna happen and because it didn't it's not going to you need to just so that away because he does have a timeline in his own throne room and those dots on that timeline is when his things are going to happen regardless of what anybody on the earth is doing it's his sovereign will and what right now this time we're in it's on his timeline it is many of the generals are going home doesn't mean they'll be oblivious to what we're doing that means they'll know all about it after they get there and the thing they'll be celebrating is us who are still down here being a part of it so God really needs us right now he's intimidating me although I probably would have never chosen except when he asked me I said yes say it's important to say yes to being chosen many are called but few are chosen because they don't choose that's why many aren't chosen he can't make you do it right you're called you're being called but he can't make you do that you have to choose yes and when you do that you're saying yes I want to be chosen and then you're chosen what does it take to be chosen say choose yes then you got to be willing he makes it a little bit you know gotta be willing and obedient say willing obedience next say surrender is not control a lot of people think it is because you know God does have he does have I'm trying to think of the natural earthward it's like not there he does have guidelines is that right even Jesus had them that he operated by Jesus didn't just pick things on his own all the time where did he say I do yeah what his father said right but he showed him and what he told him that's what he did that's why we need revelation otherwise we're gonna get man's mind set on everything and that hasn't worked well has it he's not going to abandon the church I've heard all kinds of things when people's gonna abandon the church it's just gonna go away burn down we don't need it anymore let's get rid of it when he's not saying that to me he's going to set it on fire amen this is a time to be willing and obedient if you want to eat the fat of the land and Jesus did ask us to pray about one other thing pray that my people say we are his people be willing and the day of his power well obviously if he's going to give us revelation to operate like he does and part of that is power he says he'll give you power over all the part of the enemy there's one right there he's given us power and he does have power so if this is the day of his power the biggest thing the most important thing is remember the willing and obedient thing what he asked probably won't seem natural or normal to you wasn't natural normal to ask me to have pink hair I wasn't a pink haired person I liked it he wouldn't have asked me it's better than camel hair I like pink here any day over camel hair it smells it's stiff not comfortable and he had to wrap himself in it okay my pink hair is a test it divides asunder the Spirit from the flesh so those who trash or bash it or in the flash are we still so walking the flash say no we're supposed to walk in the so people don't have to tell me if they're hearing their flesh or hearing their spirit it's the way they react to the pink care now people who like pink hair they think is amazing so the world must be passing their tests because they all love it that's amazing you look amazing what do you do I'm a spokesperson for haven't I've been there and then they all say the same thing they don't say you're liar your father's property was that they go what was it like what was it like is it beautiful is it amazing is it real is is God real is there a god and go oh yes there is a God and you lived inside of him before you came here okay that makes him interested not bashing amen try that next time you did live in him you moved in and out of him he was your very existence you had your very existence in him that's why he knew you that's why he saw you before he sent you here you're wonderfully and perfectly made your souls were the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's Revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well I'm missing that no Adam became a living Saint loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to God that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life it's probably one of the least talked about things in the church it's a soul growing up I always heard that it was bad and went but God made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with God and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your souls fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody you wound and hurt eunuch stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand I was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time I never usually know but I looked at my clock and I was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it look like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause her soul to prosper all the time and then they live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that where B means lib it's called divine health so I since I learned about the father taught me about that he said people can loose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you loose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can loose from your soul and he said I know most people buying the devil but the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talked about the loosing thing what are gonna do with the loosing key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of God to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about God will never be taken from you and so people I know you know if you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it I'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue in your anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all it comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to loose that's that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of God as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming home you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're gonna do some spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll be excited you mean leaving an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're gonna have some fire sent the Angels already outside waiting but they're gonna do that tomorrow night I did this recently where I mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time just darkening I want to say drops of it the fire of God is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our God is a consuming fire I'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of Christ send the fire I want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart I mean literally make sure your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with God the fire it burns it out then he puts him in selves in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from God two stones a fire I find a one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that Satan left on some other planet that was in a Bible and I already knew what they were so God made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they were inside God or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the River of Life that's in him the river flows out of him the gemstones flow out of him even the steps of the throne room have gemstones they flow out of heaven and become the crystal see is called the crystal see because there's gemstones in it not sand that's why it's cut crystal faceted gemstones they're all over heaven they all come from one place when the father and the firewood burn inside of him and Lucifer would step in and there's his holy mountain inside God say God is not a man he doesn't look the same inside that we do but we lived there that's why we like sparkly things way back in our way back in our spirit man we remember that we met we remember that there's something that connects when we look at something that's brilliant and beautiful gemstones represent the love of God his love his revelation upon this rock I know he said Peter was a rock when God says rock in the Bible he's talking about a gemstone you know that white rock that white rock rock or stone you're gonna get when you go home to heaven and there's a name under the only he and you know it's a white diamond it's not a River Rock every syllabus I ever saw showed a river rock when it talked about that that stone so inside his eternity you never see at the end there's no end inside of him no end and we ran up and down this mountain and we slid down the river of life and would jump on the stones of fire through the flames we lived in those flames you're about to get baptized with him it's amazing I don't even know what time it is I better check what time is it oh my my see gem she's at it you didn't finish talking about Ron McClellan remember I was at his service right and I can I come in with these books in his parents and grandparents are sitting on the front row I didn't know him so but I knew a couple people there at celebration Church they let me come in and I just was going to wait till everything was over and they were everybody with their line going by the casket and he had this bright yellow suit on I mean bright with his big white tie and and he had the biggest fro I've ever seen on a human they had to stick it down in the casket and as I was walking I was walking up I looked up I was trying not to laugh out loud because it was an open portal and he was watching his service and now this is a band right band in a van travelling telling jokes non-stop doing sock puppets you know crazy stuff he did crazy things in the van with the guys and his band was there and they were telling the funniest stories and every time they say something funny he would go like this is here we go so here I'm looking at the casket and then I look up there he was alive for now and there was a lot of funny stories right so I'm like this is just this crazy it was so much fun and so I went back sat down and then it came up when I gave out the books and I didn't know who his parents were I knew who his wife was and her mom dad were there and I gave them one and I didn't know that was his father sitting there so I was telling you know his wife this is a book about heaven I really think it a bless you and I started to turn away and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take an extra one so of course willing and obedient I had an extra one in a little bag wondering who was gonna give it to and he grabbed my arm II said did you say that book was about heaven I said yes I I've been there he says can I have that book and I said yes yes you can have and he goes well I'm Randstad well was then this was for you because I didn't know you were gonna be here but he told me to bring it so this is your book and a few months later I get a phone call it's always in the middle of night and it's his parents and they're undone they were so full of joy in celebration after reading about what heaven was like they already knew what their son would be doing having a band and he does have a man and it's called the other side of the story his heaven he went from story side be to the other side of the story that was his bayum but in the band angels were playing and singing with him because he said he wouldn't let anyone take the place of his band when they came to heaven which I told their band and so his parents called they were really excited about everything and and then I they gave me their daughter's phone number he and his sister were really close together and so I called and just spoke to her for a few minutes and and then about I don't know it was probably a year later she called me she goes today is my birthday my 30th birthday and I just wanted to know does my brother even remember me does he still think about me because we had planned a big celebration on this day we didn't know he'd go home so I while she's on the phone to me God caught me up to heaven and I saw her brother standing at a portal this goes sound wild but it didn't matter he was throwing Cheetos at her from the portal and he was singing the worst rendition of happy birthday I've ever heard and this is a guy who sings sent was singing for a living right like me and this that's awful that's awful and then God sends me back and I'm she's still going on the phone I said wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to you hey I don't know what you can think about this but I got to tell you what what I just saw in heaven I saw your brother and he was throwing Cheetos over the portal at you and she starts to yell and scream she goes that that's she said he even had a throw by he run by what do you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he had her fro to so he said his greatest thing to do was run through the room and throw as many Cheetos in her fro that would stick there and she said he did it all the time and I was so irritated but now it's the most precious thing in the world that you told me that because I know he didn't forget me this is on her birthday remember and I said oh I don't know how to tell you this but he he sounded the worst I have ever heard for someone who's anointed to sing she said was it the worst happy birthday you ever heard in your life I want ya she said he did that every year too so she was so blessed to find out she that he had not changed he still remembered her he was still himself and she was so blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen I finished the story I'm done with okay so I want to encourage you to understand that your family still loves you no one has forgotten you they're making plans for you in this little vapor of time that we're in right now on this earth use it powerfully to love to forgive and to be willing and obedient understand John his last message loved one another that should be the thing we do the most amen don't forget to love if you get a choice forgive people who are bashing you when you do that it really does wound the demons and it is our time to torment the Nieman's say it's our honor and privilege to torment the demons those demons ask Jesus have you come to torment just before our time that meant that was going to be a time when they would be tormented is that right but he didn't do that he gave us power right so stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul is still enjoying his celebration party it goes on for quite a while I know that has something spent planned for him for anyone who ever wanders he made it no matter what you thought about his life or consider for him he loved God he had Christ in his heart he made mistakes he repented for them amen and he's highly honored and recognized in heaven for what he did for God and they're happy to have him home and so is his mom amen so let's make a declaration I love to make declarations say father thank you for timing my birth on the earth for right now I expect to receive the more to live in the more to be the more it is my commission I'm saying yes right now I want to be chosen help me to be willing and obedient and laugh while I do it I asked for and receive lots of fun I need fun heaven has fun on earth as it is in heaven I want to be dangerous against hell the enemy is my doormat but I am a ruler with Jesus Christ I am royalty I am your son or daughter this is the time I've been waiting for amen amen sit down do people have children here okay yeah I don't want to run too late that I don't get to lay hands on them if you have children so maybe in a few minutes I don't know what time do they pick them up okay wherever they are okay yeah I really want you given I know I'm gonna do an impartation tomorrow night I really would like to do one tonight I [Applause] think instead of talking for another 45 minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm probably getting the lightning power God last time I did it John G showed up that's who I call John G Lake he did he came and stood right next to me other seers saw him it was really zap BAM time but tonight I really want to give out a measure of the fire amen I've had a measure of baptism and fire and let me tell you I've not ever been the same so I want you to take it home with you let it burn on the inside of you don't let the fire go out what you're really doing is preparing a place for more to come say more say when I receive some of something from God I can have more I know there's major things that are about to happen in your lives shifts because this is the time to shift there's a lot of shifts the other thing is suddenly those are two different things a suddenly comes when you least expect it but just one suddenly can change your life it will fill you so full of faith when God moves his hand for you it's always a good thing say suddenly are good things because God is preparing you to receive more of him amen suddenly just send you over the edge probably about half the time suddenly czar about finances or wealth like a lot not like wow someone gave me a hundred dollars like a lot we've had quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm asking God to give you some of those also amen so when I when I heart fire to you I'm gonna add suddenly okay say I want the Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting ready for them I'm serious I really wanted God I'm a suddenly son or daughter so send it there you go now you set yourself up so I just want to get ready to lay hands on people it doesn't matter how old you are you can have a suddenly and you can also have the fiery men I see some kids running around they're gonna be fierce I'm talking about children yeah I have several grandchildren that already are fierce so I expect them to be fierce amen say fierce is a good word in this more time of God it's passionate remember the word says we take it by force so don't do don't be mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to take it by force amen in the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and encourages for us to be fierce amen and dangerous and violent say violence in the spirit realm is a good thing when we have it that word suffers does not mean that heavens being beat up by somebody however back to the translations God said go read some of the translations and see how they have translated or interpreted that verse from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take up by force and it literally said people are running into heaven and stealing things I don't know where they got that heaven is under attack no I don't believe that for a second it's us who are supposed to be violently passionate against the enemy and we had the right to take back whatever he has taken from us because he had no right to it Amen I love giving revelation in the word - it actually makes sense amen training up your child and the gift God put in them whether it's a drummer or a baker or an interior designer in the never depart from that gift because they'll be doing the thing they love the most that word in there says train up a child in the Ben or the way he made them that means who he sent you as what gift he made you and sent you here every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights and God said everybody sits on the few of the chair every Sunday trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is but one of the most important gifts he gave you is your natural gift your passion what you love what he made you to be or do in this earth that's not your job it's the thing you're the most passionate about you know your child is a drummer if they beat everything everything they have they beat on the table with it you know straw spoons forks whatever it is you buy them a farm you know the farm is set for Christmas and they pick them up and start beating on something with them the cow and the horse here they go take them in a restaurant they use the straws take them outside so they'll be quiet and then they break branches off the bush and start drumming with the bush say I think they're a drummer so raise them up as a drummer and they'll never run around the world trying to figure out who they are does that scripture make sense it's a revelation that's how important your natural gift is because when you go to heaven he plans to use it it's irrevocable you meant to be a baker make the best brownies or whatever it is you make everybody in the neighborhood loves them that everybody tells you to sell them when you go home to heaven you're going to make that and everybody will have it for free and everybody will love you they have rodeos amusement parks because people have gifts that do that is that right that's why we have fun in heaven and it's so natural they walk in heaven and here's all the stuff they need to design and to put together something that won't take forever to make it you're gonna be a baker as part of your mansion you have a full out kitchen with supernatural devices to use and all the supplies you need and then out in the front you have a bakery where everybody comes body your stuff Jesus will visit you regularly he has a sweet tooth that's why he liked honeycomb remember we served on the beach to his disciples remember he served him a meal he gave them what fish and say honey when it is cousin eat locusts and it ran in the family say I'm in the family now I know why I have a sweet tooth amen okay we're going to we're going to do this amen so I guess you can get people organized unless I tell everybody to come one row at a time and I'm gonna come down here you're gonna walk up to me I'm gonna just zap you with the fire God and then what do you want them to do next you want him to come and sit yeah Margaret stone I couldn't do this without mark or actually my team really I have a team I have like 15 people now I don't do this by myself amen every now and then I go okay I'm sending you this time you get up on the platform and speak and so I really do bless my team God gave me man using teams in this time the day the lone ranger is coming to a close amen we're going to need each other we're gonna work together amen and so I'm gonna give this microphone to somebody and then we'll come down here and lay hands on you don't forget to come tomorrow night it's gonna be amazing exciting walk sideways you'll never fall and then I'm gonna declare of declare our blessing over you when we're when we're done okay unless I should do it first because I don't know what you
