the cat is she is the most unique individual I think I have ever known and she she is so bold and she is so she hears God like none other not only just as a as a prophetess but the things that the Lord shows her is really profound so cat and so why don't you come and share whatever is on your heart and we look forward to it yeah there you go yeah let's stand up yeah and welcome her honor give honor where honors do yeah yeah very good very yes I gotta have my phone tell what time it is god bless you think there's a clock okay I may not look at that clock right you know right here I can look down to what time is although time really is irrelevant to me in heaven they have no time isn't that amazing it's a whole new way of life up there down here we have to keep everything scheduled and on time we have timeframes to me we have meetings you know you have to be done by some time that doesn't exist in heaven no they don't care how long you go because heaven is like forever right and if you don't know in heaven if you're going to have an event at your house and everybody does that you want you know how many people have never heard me before let me see your hands anybody here not know me Wow have you never heard of me or heard me let me see your hand you may have seen me on youtube or something I love them people go I just met you on YouTube I said I didn't know it was a meeting place but we love I love you I said we love you too that would be Father Son Holy Spirit in me if you hear me say we or they that's what I'm talking about somebody kept saying who are they Father Son and Holy Spirit who else is there right I mean if you know them you're going to talk about they I know they're a Godhead and I even know what the three-in-one is if you've never heard me say that when God speaks it is the simplest form of communication he doesn't you know he doesn't get people confused he doesn't stretch things out he doesn't expound he just says what is true and it is called they are the three-in-one that means three individual beings father son who used to be the word he was called word forever never never until he became Jesus Christ maybe didn't know that and John it explains it the word became flesh and dwelt among us right and it says it says that there wasn't anything that was made he was God he was with God and there wasn't anything that was made that was not made by him and so we're thinking well how can he make it if God made it actually that's sort of the same explanation about the three-in-one they have the ability to step inside of each other remember when Christ said you and me was talking to the Father you and me and me and you Father I pray that one day they'd be one even as we are one when you go to heaven you step inside the Father Jesus steps inside the Father Holy Spirit steps inside the father and you are one now isn't that simple that's really how that's really how it happens the father is on the throne he's not super glued to the throne by the way people think he stays there forever never no he doesn't he gets up he goes around heaven he spends time with people he has a throne room outside and from these amazing powerful mountains it looked like there they go miles and miles miles in hi where this would be an anthill compared to mountains in heaven by the way it really is I mean there's angels 2,000 miles high in heaven I'm just going to put her out there for you you ever wondered how big it was you can't limit the one you made every this earth was made like a speck in his hand all of the universe which he calls the cosmos the cosmos was made was made by him and his son what the word used to do is he would step inside the father the father would go where there was nothing he spoke what he wanted the word stepped out and made it that's why his name was the word because whatever God spoke he took it and made it and they made Adams body together they made all that you see all the unseen made the seen realm there's so much you could talk about I am going to talk about America tonight I can't escape it it's the number one thing right now that heaven is talking about is America ok God God didn't start something and then decide to drop it no oh he's moving and shaking everything in our country it's time for exposing all that was wrong and setting in place that which is right and so just for those of you who don't know me I was born again at age 4 I'm going to be 65 I kept saying I was because I forget how old I am and I'm getting younger because it says he would restore our youth like the Eagles right that wasn't just a statement he made is something you run after what you declared that we shall be established unto you you shall eat the fruit in your lips right your words are so important in the in this atmosphere in the world in your own life your words are what you create with everything he made He willed it he spoke and then it was pretty much that's the way was to operate our own life okay because if were his children for his offspring and he is our Father how much like him are we supposed to be you're living in the time when that will be openly seen in this world people living on earth like they do in heaven they call it heaven culture so don't try to change the culture just start living having culture and then you know you're different because your very life will change when you begin to do that God for the first time is letting us live on earth as they live in heaven and he calls that heaven closer I'll be talking about that tonight and it's powerful I have to live it I can't just tell you about it I literally have to live that way in my life and I do and I have not been sick in over three years I have not been attacked in over three years at all because he said and I took these words and I believe them that I live by them they give you power over all the part of the enemy and nothing by any means shall harm you so if you sit there saying that's not possible than his word right he put it in his word he meant that it's the way you live it's a type of lifestyle you have guys not given you some nice new news to hear he's given you a whole new lifestyle to live it's not something you try is something you do so you're going to hear about some new things tonight because we've got so much revelation about heaven that was one of the reasons why he showed me so much of it I know how they live I know how they communicate with each other now they're transported know how heaven operates I know what God's plans are for this earth I saw heaven before the earth was made I think glimpses of the new earth I've been anywhere everywhere in between because he chose to take me say Amen I'm going to ask you this actually I'm just going to tell you this you may not know this but everyone here has actually already been from the end of the beginning and the beginning to the end because you were in him before you came here you've always been in him so whatever he went you were with him - how about that you came from you went to the Future came back in the future he sent you here to this earth but before he did that you have been everywhere with him Wow is not a new way to look at you yeah got me undone I've actually travelled through time you know when they go into warp speed you know all those lights flying at you that is exactly what it looks like it was crazy I've always wanted ever since Star Trek especially I've wanted to be an astronaut my goal in this physical realm was to be an astronaut and I wanted to go you know I want to go check out the universe I wanted to go see the stars the planets I was captivated by what my God had made I want to be out there where he was I wanted to be in there with him even as a little girl I thought that way I was strange then ha ha ha my mom almost told me every day of my life you're so strange I don't know what God's going to do with you and my answer was always anything he wants to [Applause] I had earthly father there was an amazing dad he loved everybody including his enemies really loved his enemies - either they were embarrassed or they became his friend you could not have a fight with my father he just wouldn't do it he loved too much and he believed in God and he lived it he was talking when the most precious people I ever knew in my life and he is now in heaven celebrating on his massive ranch that I couldn't see the end to taking care of all of our pets I know every time we said when I hear him go egads you sent another one did you know nothing was impossible - God did you know he loves his creation and he loves his creatures and heaven animals aren't called animals down here we call them that and having them called creatures because every creature speaks in heaven every creature in heaven worships God they all have the ability to talk your pets will never shut up if you had a dog that drove you crazy and on your neighbors you better send them on it you know send them on a tour to go share something with people in heaven because they're not ever going to shut up and they get a hold of you you want your bark bark bark you hear did you know this happened and I saw this and this was there and I remember when you did this to me it took me here and I got to do that and all the Christmases already to get a chew on the presents and rip the paper off the present that's what you got to look forward to out there your cats climbing up from the Christmas tree trying to get them down meeting on a little your furniture they will not be doing that in your mansion when you really think about life you know through God's eyes it's amazing he looks at everybody here like you're totally complete you know if you belong to his son you're precious actually everyone is precious he loves all humanity everyone came from him there was not one person that came from some other planet there not an alien they weren't birthed by Satan although sometimes you think they were he didn't create anything except sin Satan owns nothing he's not even supposed to be in the second heaven one day he's going to be kicked out of there maybe you've never considered that by God to show me so much of the future I know how powerful we are because of Christ and how small and insignificant the enemy is our doormat we are not a doormat you are never created to be a doormat know what people say that turning the other cheek does not mean you're going to let someone beat you to a pulp because the Jesus Christ that means you choose to ignore all awful things that they've said about you all the excavations all the blast all the blasting and they've done you you turn the other cheek because you choose not to respond back and do what the enemy wants you to do okay but you're not a doormat you considered royalty in heaven if you are okay if we are kings and priests and to our god what is that that is a spiritual title of authority in this earth it's an eternal title of authority so how much authority you have as much as you're willing to take for Jesus Christ we have been given so much this is just my introduction okay I'm just trying to get because there's new people and even I want to just you know blow your box apart I tell you Jesus Christ never put anyone in a box he was out of the box in his day he was funny he was funny he was extremely rich when you satin ate with sinners those were business acquaintances he had he was extremely wealthy okay uh the only thing that draws wealth is wealth he has some of the wealthiest loans okay even Lazarus was extremely wealthy he had some Christian wealthy friends but he had some that weren't and he was he was the most captivating person they knew and if all he did was beat them up with sin they would never satin ate with him but I promise you he shared the truth he captivated them with revelation with understanding probably of outer space and other things that was never known on years before he is the spirit of prophecy that right I promise you use prophesying all the time to those people he read their books all the time while I ate with him he told some of the greatest jokes of all time I know he was it was like Jesus in his Merry Men that's what it was like I had seven brothers I they did when they got together okay it wasn't any difference they didn't follow Jesus necessarily because he was the lord of glory he was a lot of fun he always supplied in paid for all their upkeep wherever they traveled he took care of all their whatever they say whatever they ate you know he paid for that you don't have a treasure to hold your nickels he had a treasure that traveled with him he wasn't poor that's just man's tradition that told you that you're not supposed to be poor I know that the word says and I'm going to explain this is a revelation he gave me that that he became poor that we might be okay what is rich is that poor is that poverty level is SOC humble or there's that humility of holiness no he said be holy as I am holy that's the condition of you inside there's nothing doing how much money you don't have okay the enemy is not supposed to have all the money he's not we're supposed to be some of the wealthiest people in this world someone who should have the most wisdom the most fun the most money be the most radical people in asserts because we belong to him and I know what man's mindset has always told us because I was raised in wonderful denominational churches and Christ isn't abandoning the church he is married to the church guess who the churches it's us it is the body of Christ okay we're married to him how much does he love you if he's married to you he cares about everything in your life but you need truth in Revelation so that will dispel all the things the myths and the lies and the bondage that the enemy has taught man to put us in and if you don't have revelation and this time revelation comes from God it doesn't come from man when you hear something you've never heard before that came from God like explaining how what the three-in-one is how simply caught me up I think up to heaven thousands of times I lost count I stopped counting okay I don't count anymore it doesn't even matter even this morning he showed me things in heaven I get up for the first two hours he's pretty much kills me with revelation I don't want to leave the room because I want more and I start my day by talking to him I start my day when my eyes open father I ask for and receive grace for this day for abundant life and they filming fuel from heaven did you know you can get that every day yourself jewel from heaven for every day of your life that's why Christ could walk through this earth the way he did did you know that the word says that the father filled his son with His grace while he was a child you will find it you look it up well what does good grace does God have I'm not mother father the father has grace he actually has a throne of that's his throne and he says come before my throne of grace is that right to find grace for help in time of need is that what the word says that means to come and get it for every day of your life what is that grace its grace for abundant life Christ gives us grace for eternal life say correct yes but there's more and you can live the abundant life by asking for that grace I know I've been doing it for like eight years it changed me it changed me the first day I did it because I didn't come out of that room filled full of me I came up filled full of heaven it's almost like it's laying just like you're walking in a dream but it's real because nothing can penetrate or touch you like before things used to pierce you right they pierce you they wound you you get upset or you get offended even though you didn't want to you get angry really angry about things so frustrated in confusion none of that can penetrate you that's why you didn't penetrate Christ okay God didn't even give him a choice he is as I filled my son with my grace as a child I feel my son with my grace that was great for abundant life that's why Christ said I come to bring life and bring yet more abundantly it's really all in the word and I received so much revelation on the word it also changed me that's not man's interpretation it's not man's mindset or assumption of what they think it means it's from the Father amen Jesus introduced me to the Father he's the only way back to the Father he is a door to the Father and the reason why he was willing to die was because he knew he would open that door for us to receive him and it would bring us back to heaven where we came from this the gospel is very simple okay we had to have a way to come back to him we had to have something that was holy enough to be sacrificed they would wipe away all the sins because Christ doesn't keep you out of heaven he's the only way to heaven his blood doesn't keep you out of heaven it keeps wickedness evil in sin out of heaven so the only way you get rid of that stuff is by receiving him say Amen because the father has absolutely informed me face-to-face it says the pure in heart shall say that really loud don't let people say you cannot see the face of God Christ is what changed it on Christ when you receive him and his sacrifice it wipes everything out literally in the spirit realm when you receive guys you get a shower of the blood of Christ on the inside that wipes everything off every sin from as far back as you ever did it it removes it from you like you never did it it makes you righteous okay that means you have you're standing upright before God you have right standing before God because of Christ that is what Glaus you into heaven okay because you're not going in there carrying all your sins witness and evil and the father has in ant face-to-face to me sad I will not allow the entire earth come to heaven the way they are because if either all earths come to heaven without my son heaven would be just like this earth and say we don't want it like that why living here and go through all this mess right why go through all this stuff that's in people in wicked people evil everyone live like that and go to having to live the same way say he kicked it out and it's not coming back in so people who tell you a loving God wouldn't send people to hell he doesn't he actually makes away so you can come back to him he wants you to come to heaven but there's only one way there and that's still his son Jesus Christ I'm just preaching preaching right now I was I was raised on this stop I was raised we live by faith we lived that way growing up I'm one of 15 that alone was not easy that will kill you right there people say you're going to have a school if I have the school it would be the school of dying the school of dying to your flesh is what we all need amen I had to die to my flesh to do this I I couldn't be continually being taken up to heaven before the father showing me the future showing me the past showing his the very way he's made and created on the inside on the outside revealing the Word of God to me and he didn't do any of that just so I would sound good he did it to change you he wants you to know who he is so you'll know who you are amen because the more we know them the more you know you let us make man in our image and after the way we operate did you know that's what the word likeness meant people think he's saying the same thing in Genesis 1:26 there's a scripture for you what does it make man in our image and after our likeness there's the word our again father-son hold spirit let us make them look like us and let us help them operate like us so that's where I get all the authority the Dominion having revelation understanding what life is in heaven you know that's what that means that's what that means I can operate like them because I know how they operate right and so this is what we need to hear up here behind a pulpit to be a holy place that brings life hope a future in freedom ok that's what it was made for it was never meant to spread deception deception is the opposite of truth deception puts you in bondage it does not make you free although many people say you can freely sin I don't know anywhere in the entire Bible that he ever said you can freely send you well they're preaching that if you've never heard it I promise you I were preaching it sometimes in Christian colleges check out the professors who are teaching your children it's reading one of the worse I call it a plague when the worst plague done on the earth today is deception and many people are being pulled on because it just sounds right it sounds kind you know the grace covers everything and so freely sin because the grace will cover it but that's what they're saying they're saying you don't have to repent and I know the scriptures and he's talking to believers when he said this if you confess your sins that he was righteous and just to forgive you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness because unrighteousness is not right standing with God you see that sin means you don't have right standing with God if you repent what did you just say I will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you from all of that so you again have a right standing and you are righteous sin and never helped anybody except the devil and did you actually know that you can live sin free I live sin free I do not sin I don't send it all not about anything anytime anywhere I don't send and I'm a human I'm a female human who lives in free on this earth and it's more fun than sinning that doesn't mean I'm going to beat you up about your issues or your mistakes okay I used to have issues and mistakes myself but there was a point in my life where I decided I'm not I'm tired of it it's not worth it it's helping the devil it's giving him ammunition you're going to beat you up later with it I mean really beat you up because it gets in your soul and he reminds you all the time I know people I know people they're finally free after years and years of years of being stuck in that snare of the enemy then he put you then he wants you there okay and eventually he's going to drag you to hell and torture you he doesn't love anybody not even his own demons he despises them he rules them with fear don't let fear in your life God never told us to fear and actually he said fear not take no thought for what your life I think it pretty much covers everything people go people said how could you stand there and say that the way you said it like like like what it was real because it was real I mean I knew I absolutely knew that he had chosen Trump for the presidency I even knew his reasons he didn't have to tell me but he did because he was the right person in case you didn't know he likes business people I was a business person I was not a pastor of an in the Fievel ministry I was a business person he pulled me out of my knifes office job and stuck me here with pink hair that was before that was before even it was heaven culture I didn't know that was normal in heaven but it is everybody has color in their hair in heaven some of them have diamond dust some of them have living stuff put in their hair it's alive now does that sound like heaven yeah you shout glory to God you create a rainbow bridge and you cross over the crystal sea now that doesn't sound like this world does it when anyone talks about heaven you better hear stuff you never heard of before unless you've been there it should be something that captivates your mind that you never even consider because that's what the word says I have not seen nor ear heard nor entered in the heart or mind of man see I do know the word except unless the Spirit of God reveals it to you that's the rest of the scripture some people say part of a scripture am i making that sound is that me I know I know what the word says and in heaven was one of the greatest mysteries probably the last greatest mystery of all time what does it look like everybody knows we worship as as a worship you knew you got two pieces of clothing a gallon of salvation and a robe of righteousness right yes it didn't say you're going to get wings in heart by the way you don't want wings what would you do with a 12 foot high pair of wings on the back of your foot the back of your person you would sit on shut them in the door whack people when you move to the right or the left who's not people over you were never created to be an angel we actually are over the Angels it says that we will judge angels right yes so don't think that you're lower than the Angels I know there's a scripture that actually says God made you a little lower than the Angels but you know in the Greek and Hebrew you know with that word actually means I made you a little bit lower than them we were made a little bit lower than down right I don't know if you knew that but that's what that says I guess I think that DM and I remember who was at the the English that translated the Bible right the King James Version taking Holy Spirit the King James Version I think maybe they thought that was just too wild that we were a little lower than God but he said no not the year gods and that's a little G did you know that's in the word we all do but nobody wants to go there because you don't know what it means it means he is our Father we are made in their image to operate like them we will never be God say Amen he's not going to give you a plant with a bunch of people okay you have to win and then help get there and go so that you're not going to repeat that all right but he will give you a planet one day to create fun places on it you're staring at me does that sound like God I'm not talking about a human who made the planets is there anything on them no say no there's no civilizations on the planets they're a blank canvas [Music] if our father is a Great Creator right and his son the word created with him that's how they operate okay that's why we have inventions where do you think they come from it says every witty idea comes somewhere yeah they come from having people invent creat all over heaven all the time even more than you do here his ultimate goal for us is to do that you don't have to take vacations somewhere on heaven now number one you're not going to really work you're going to use your gift where's your gift not your job you have now say Amen you will not have a 8 to 5 or 9 to 5 job when you take a little card and stick it in the time clock which by the way I used to do that a long time ago you're not going to have some supervisor breathing over your neck because you didn't do something right you can't be fired he's not going to take away your retirement point that is your retirement plan living there ok all of your family member and friends are having the best time of their life they're not suffering they're not sick not all they're not handicapped or not in fear amen they don't experience any of that in heaven they exist to live their body might be dead the day you know what it says the dead in Christ to rise that is your body say that's my body it's still a part of me that part sleeps well we have an awesome time in heaven it clearly says that and let me tell you I always tell people if you choose to die and go to heaven you will not miss the rapture when it happens you actually know about the rapture before any human being on earth knows about it because you will be coming with them is that right it says that you get your bodies back first it will be instantly glorified forever and you will then be immortal not mortals and then those who are alive and remain in my correct my being correct those who are alive and remain will be caught up and changed in an instant right in your own body you'll be changed instantly you will be glorified you will become immortal because as immortality must take on immortality there you go there's there's a sermon from the Bible however when you got revelation on that it gets a lot more exciting okay revelation you're supposed to live like they do up there right now on earth you know source of waste you get to heaven okay you know suppose the way to get to heaven no because we have been calling this in for probably ages or generations at least when Christ said pray this way right our Father now who are we talking about one I'm not going to make some clarification here when he said our Father he meant the Father in heaven right our Father who is in heaven holy is your name that's what how old means okay holy is your name whose kingdom is coming say that's heaven that he's talking about say the kingdom of heaven is what Jesus was talking about so we're basically telling the father your kingdom of heaven come to earth and then what is that going to look like your will on earth as it is in heaven that is called heaven culture that is a way of life okay so I'm not making this up it's in the word it's on the word that meant there had to be a time before the millennial reign I'm talking about before the end comes there had to be a time when heaven would be seen operating innocent through us on this earth living on earth like they do in heaven because we asked for it we declared it decreed it god had already planned it this is before the Millennial age because Christ won't need our help say Amen but the word also says that there will be a generation a group of type of people on this earth that will taste of the powers of the age to come well the next age after this kingdom age is the Millennial age that means we are that group and type of people that will taste to the powers of the Millennial age where people will live to be seven and eight and nine hundred years old that's that's one of the manifestations of heaven being on this earth and there you go I mean that really doesn't even I mean you don't even mention having in that part but it does say there'll be a group and type that we're generation means in the word it can mean three things just because I'm going to clarify some more stuff for you hum a little people okay the word generation can mean a time span most of the time it doesn't by the way two other meanings are a group and type of people and it means an age you can go look it up okay this generation shall not pass away until all these things be fulfilled including the coming of the son of man that word generation means a group and type of people and everybody thought it meant those who are alive when Israel became a nation and that generation that was here when Israel became a nation in 1948 that they would not pass away until the coming of the Son of Man it happened so that age grew which I obey now all right that was almost 60 years ago am I correct yeah well if people were 60 and 70 then where are they right now if they belong to Christ they're in heaven right now that word in that scripture did not mean a time span it meant a group and type of people that means it could be whenever God chose her to be on the earth that a group of type of people would live like they would in the Millennial days when sickness would be almost non-existent that they would live to be hundreds and hundreds of years old because it also says about the Millennial age that if someone died at a hundred would be like a child dying because back in the ancient times you all should know this yourself people live to be six and seven hundred years old is that correct yeah that was the fourth flood that was before all that stuff happened that's how old people live and I'm thinking man how easy was that mean they weren't live in heaven culture right but God sustained them and what about Sarah all the women say I am NOT Sarah I don't want to be Sarah she was a hunter when she had a baby but let me tell you she looked amazing she looked really good for being that old because God had purpose to give Abraham his promise right and you know why he needed that promise so the Jewish race would exist on the earth so he always had a plan of why he did things he has a plan while you're sitting here right now because he wants you to live on earth like they do in heaven it is my number one thing that he has me teach about besides America okay living on earth like they do in heaven well heaven is amazing there's no way to even look at this right now and you actually had a glimpse of heaven you think I don't know how that is possible well because of God and his timeline it is very much possible amen this is the thing you have to do you have to choose to live it your will is the most important thing in you you will is the heart of your being when God said heart he meant your soul amen your soul you're not just a human being you are a living did you know that he said Adam was a living that means you are - that's how important your soul is well I know what human soul looks like I know how it operates I know how to make it prosper why did he show me that so you could do it it's the most important thing you probably ever learn because you'll change your whole entire life you'll change how you live you change your physical condition your mental condition the way you operate the way you act the way you respond to people what you think about and what you choose will change so yeah I've seen a living soul it's it's beautifully made and I know growing up in the past in mind denomination we always told the soulless realm was bad how many people say Amen you knew that maybe you didn't know back in the day when they talked about the soul it was never good and yet we would all say oh my soul and others within me bless your Holy Name right and yet they would turn on say the soul is not good I'm like I'm like eight and I'm like are they thinking about what they're saying because what they told me a few minutes ago does not line up with the fact that my soul's rejoicing and blessing God so if all that is within me is if my soul was bad and all that is within my soul is bad how can I bless him did they know what they're talking about obviously didn't know what they were talking haha it's true isn't it this is how revelation changes you when he shows you in reveals in the word this is what I meant when I said this but there's a way to make your soul prosper and he even says in the word it says in the word if you want to prosper and be in health what does it say so if if your soul people used to say ignore the soul just focus on the spirit and I have to be your spirit man is very important right you have that spirit before you have this body we're a little being your spirit was made out of light it still is made out of light but in heaven which is a spiritual world in a spiritual realm you have a literal life I mean you touch things you have a real mansion you live in that spiritual body operates in the spirit realm sort of like your physical body does in this earth say Amen I'm not going to tell you something that's not true I would be in trouble with my father and I'm not going to do that heaven is a spiritual realm okay your spiritual body came from there it says in the word our citizenship is in you know where you came from is where your citizenship is that right my citizenship here is in America I was born an American I am an American god bless america god bless the red white and blue you know I was born in America so my citizenship is there wherever you're born in the world that's where your citizenship is some countries let you have a dual citizenship like England will let you have one there and have on you I think Canada probably will I'm not sure but I know there are some countries that let you have two citizenships well our original citizenship is from the place we came from it's heaven or he wouldn't have told you your citizenship was there well that's how that's this is how detailed the father is being right now with me it's detailed revelation because you have to see yourself that you came from there you didn't live on a planet you didn't have a home in heaven at that time God was your home the father he said I am your father you are my offspring I carried you like in a womb of a mother and he actually said we played in the River of Life so when he made the womb of a woman he put water in it so it would be normal to us that makes sense when he sent you from themselves he made that womb sort of like when we lived in him we played in the River of Life so we were in water all the time in that awesome you ran inside of the father and played on the stones of fire that shoot the rainbow outside of him you played in the rainbow you played in the rainbow don't we all go oh look at that rainbow because something deep inside of you gets reconnected with him when you see those colors it's here sign say that's God's sign and that's his promise the image belongs to him and he recently told me whoever wears that image or fly that image is calling me to them [Applause] somebody get Marge Gardner [Applause] there's a whole group of people marking themselves for salvation [Music] it will never be anyone else's image it says there's a rainbow round about the throne it comes from him net awesome I love rainbows what about double rainbows and triple rainbows around rainbows I've actually seen round rainbows I've actually seen God draw a round burnt rainbow in the sky with his finger I was in a foreign country and I saw him do that she told me my father to fast and pray for three days and meet him on this mountain and he drew a round rainbow right where right above where we were took about two hours it was glorious sing and for the first time I saw heaven coming down to that rainbow I saw a living stairway come it looked like glory mist and I saw angels walking up and down in that and coming down to that rainbow he actually drew a portal in the shape of a rainbow and awesome [Laughter] God loves color he created color he created everything and he loves color he loves coloring your hair on your clothes yeah I love your purple dizzy you are rocking it and yes he did tell me I would have pink highlights in my hair I didn't I wasn't a pink haired person trust me I was a business person I had a wonderful job I worked with CEOs I loved it I trained in the business industry I've worked there for 25 years and 10 he got really strange and took me out and made me wear pink hair started taking me to heaven [Music] he didn't even warn me didn't even warn me okay he didn't warn me and I never said I want pink and I want to go to heaven all the time I didn't say that I'm like I'm going to do whatever you want me to do I'm going to speak for you I'm going to breathe for you on a bu one assistant want people to see when they see me I want them to hear you when they hear me I want to love like you love I want to give like you give that's just what I used to say to him all the time you heard me all the time say that to him and I would just take time and sit in a room and I would just sit there and tell how much I loved them I did that day after day after day after day after day and one day Jesus Christ walked through the wall of my home for the first time I was probably like 25 years ago and he and he never stopped his presence will consume me he begin to share things with me I just was so much in love with him I understand there's a higher love than our physical law in heaven that's what you experience you you don't crave things like your physical flesh did down here as far as the love is concerned there's a much higher love in heaven trust me his name is Jesus Christ and so I I was taken on this journey through my whole life helped with all my siblings I'm number 3 there were 15 of us we had one bathroom that right there she had killed yeah my brothers all thought they were mr. wonderful they took more time in the bathroom than any of the girls did we were all a bunch of my mom used to say I raised all chiefs and no Indians okay and we all thought we knew everything you didn't we didn't have visitors in our home we did have victims however because we get you in a corner and we would drill you and talk to you all of us at the same time it was loud and noisy but we had God it wasn't perfect but we did know God amen and he raised me that way on purpose so I would know he was real and I know a lot of people weren't raised that way they didn't have a good childhood they didn't have parents that loved them or they were abandoned or rejected or worse they were abused and we helped people like that so I knew that stuff existed my dad would move him in would love them we would help people every way we can we give him our food our clothes our furniture we had never-ending changes in her household we didn't have a decor okay it was called giveaway that's what it was we had giveaway furniture because we always gave it away we found people who had less than we did and we wanted to help change their life and and you live in the greatest time to be alive anew because of what he's about to give us I look at money as something to help people to help to heal to bless we need money and Christ was extremely wealthy and I'm also going to give you some revelation before I actually start talking about what I'm supposed to talk about my introductions are exciting but I do usually have a focused revelation to give you focus you will be glad you know that the last four years I have stood in the middle of America on Resurrection morning usually in the morning when I'm supposed to be sleeping he even stretches me and he'll give me stuff to declare and release in the atmosphere at a high level of authority that shocks and shockwaves to the land through the air through the sea and releases his voice and his purposes in the earth I've done that every single year that's where I'll be next year and and then I say things and I see in the spirit what happened when I did it and we were heading into powerful times we can't escape it we just we cannot escape it and my sister has recently given me not Jen but one of my other sisters have given me a key keys are one of the symbols of the kingdom age if you don't have like big keys or something to hang around hang on get crowns symbols of crowns keys peacock feathers are talking about seers the seer anointing it also represents royalty and the living creatures and having this way have eyes and their feathers there's many defined things oops that was anointing I just been on the platform I just leave it up here so I do that to my sister by mistake Jen she goes you spit on me what you were highly anointed now she says I have my own anointing I know but don't spit on me so he had me take this key she gave me no this long it's got gems all the way out the stem of the key around it but in the middle is a magnifying glass and when she handed to me God said this is a key for clarity and he had me take that and actually had me unlock a door of clarity he had me unlock it first for President Trump and vice president pounds that they would have clarity and hear him clearly and and have clarity in every decision they made so watch for more clarity in them I unlocked I literally saw a spirit of clarity fly over 2 DC into the White House and then he had me unlock it again for the body of Christ everybody say I receive clarity in my life [Applause] it helps you focus it really helps you focus because you it's very clear you know the vision is clear to you what he said it's clear to you the path is clear to you that he's putting you on he put you on a path he put you in a path he put you on a path say I want God's path not man God's path will get you where he wants you to go and don't get pulled off that path deception will pull you off that path it will keep you all set past and so you don't want that when you have clarity and discernment you will be able to recognize and identify deception and we need that right now because there's so much of it in the body of Christ and so I took that key of clarity I unlocked the door to clarity for the White House and Trump and parents and their staff to be more clearly focused on things but he's pretty focused already and he's going to get even more focused okay and you're going to him talk more about people think he's putting it on they think he's making it up talking about God he's not making up anything are you kidding four months before he ever got won the election he was hearing from every major prophet that knew what time it was okay not the ones he thought right you know get on your rapture rug you're going to be rescued you know some people still think that because they don't have revelation and they don't know what time it is but those who've been waiting for this time in God to change our nation because they knew he would change it all of them went and met with him they would prophesy to him he let them lay hands on him pray over him everybody pray he wanted as many hands and prayers that he could get because he knew he wasn't going to get that without God so he was he was already on God's team whether he sounded like nah and I tell people you can get on the foam team again in God's team because he's already on God's team okay but never in the history of our country I've ever seen people really be drawn to a candidate because they were hungry for hope and he actually had a plan no one else had the motto make America great again okay everybody was saying everything else and so now they're going to have clarity more clarity he had me declare and decree I took my king of staff I have a king staff and he said when you go out there you're going to release top and you're getting an impartation than the staff which means more of God you know get a staff this heaven culture get a staff write things on the staff hang keys and crowns on the staff you know that's not strange command it might be but not to God you know when you declared the Korean you hit that staff seals it when you hit that staff in the spirit realm it's like a shock wave because I every time I hit my staff I see a shock wave go out it increases your level of faith because you begin to actually feel what God is giving you putting into you you hear more clearly a staff was normal even back in ancient times to have and how many times to God speaks with the staff or demonstrate to that staff right parting of the Red Sea when it butted remember Aaron's Robin that was a staff how it but I mean all kinds of things he did he have salt appear on the outside of it sometimes guilty manifestations like that for you you need to get serious and show God I'm serious about doing this stuff I want to live heaven culture I want to demonstrate manners for you I want to rule and reign with Christ right now I'm so tired to end me beating me up and because we've been tolerating it we have just been putting up with it we have been participating and tolerating what the enemy is doing to us and every time you say I don't have I can't do I never will you're actually participating with the enemy because those are not God's words he has great plans for you he wants you to run your race he want you to live heaven culture you have power over the enemy to tread upon serpents and scorpions right cast out demons heal the sick raise the dead what is that stuff those are super natural powers given by Jesus Christ he gave you a deposit of anointing that he walked in on the source when you became born-again first John 2:27 look it up when you receive Jesus Christ you receive a deposit of the anointing everybody say the anointing breaks the yoke you carry that you carry a break or anointing because the anointing breaks the yoke and I says he gave you a deposit of it but you have to send it out and use it in order to get more say to get more I have to operate it the anointing was so great in Peter that it wasn't his shadow that healed people it was the anointing that it was so large outside of me like a cloud around him and it went wherever he went and when he walked with that anointing he passed people they got healed so how much more does he want us to do today [Applause] see you have weapons he gave us weapons he didn't just say well I love you you know and when you get saved people go well now you're born again you receive Christ in your heart here's your Bible I'll pray for you some churches mentor you some do I'm not putting everybody in that same off but a lot of them that's it you know come to church will welcome you here we're happy to have you here they have a place where they can hear the read hear the word of God and in the past at least it wasn't twisted so make sure you know what version of the Bible you got everybody except Adams housecat is writing a translation of the Bible and some of them aren't good and some of them aren't saved some of them weak parts of the Bible out and call it a Bible I went by one I'm not talking about the older New Testament I'm talking about they literally are taking out parts of the Bible and leaving them out because they have accountability in them they have consequences they have a protocol on how to operate they have things that are required of you they leave all those parts out the only the part about the love of God and how important special you are to God it's okay to send all you want to I know what the word says about sin you know why he doesn't like it because you don't have power over the enemy when you said Christ said I give you power over all the father said there's none of him and me and you can live without him in you trust me you don't need him anyway you don't need the devil he doesn't like you he doesn't want you kill steal and destroy is his rule that's what he lives by Christ comes to bring life and more abundantly he comes to give you authority and power and dominion over the very earth the water the land the sea all the creatures on you it's just listed ruling and reigning with Christ pushing back darkness casting out demons the kingdom of heaven shows up when you cast out demons I think that's what they said in the Bible but when you play it with a demon you can't cuss them out some people think that's really cool to do that by the way the earth itself because I've seen the future is becoming more and more spiritually oriented what does that mean that means they'll consider the spirit that they follow before they will consider men's head knowledge depending on what spirit they follow they'll live in areas where they where they operate in that spirit that's and they're kids that believe in that spirit to schools they will they're going to work certain clothing that demonstrates the images of that spirit they follow they already kind of do that because when you're a Muslim you wear the clothing that represents that image right even Buddhists you know and some of the three-stage there has I mean they do things because they're portraying an image of what they believe in so that means you need to have colored hair we're the most radical clothes take authority have power in your life you know let your soul prosper because that's his image that's heavens image and we bring life hope joy celebration a future a future the greatest future that will ever be is what Jesus Christ brings us say man and yet people need they want to make him sound like oh he was in the past you know they even water down what he did none of that is true it's an antichrist spirit anything us against Jesus Christ you could you have all different flavors of it out there but it's still an antichrist spirit anything that takes you away from Christ or water's down his authority or who he is is an antichrist spirit amen this is a day to be great I remember when he told me he told me this when I was watching something I don't know if you ever saw one time member there's some movies I'll mention because I actually watching that watch them you need to know what's in the movies before you watch them because frequency sounds and images carry spirits with them and I mean there's some really good movies even secular movies just some good ones out there that are watched they're fun they're excited and you actually learn something from it but you're not gonna learn any seeing from graphic violence sexuality profane language that's not going to cause your soul to prosper say Amen so you choose with your will what you think represents what God would want you to have because he's for you he's not against you in other words he actually is taking Hollywood so for a long time we'll have awesome amazing movies produced from there he's taking Hollywood many of them are becoming born-again they're making them change the scripts as they are filming them because they're not the same people who signed the contract see all things are possible for cotton because you know if Hollywood impact this world and they're putting out words sounds images songs frequencies and they release all kinds of things in the spirit that you don't see and people think it's all fantasy and it's not when you get things that make you feel good that make you laugh that's like a medicine so they're tweaking their movies I can tell you already they're freaking them because they're bombing some of their big big ones they want to release our bombing and they're losing money because the same moral majority that help the believers vote Trump in that same moral majority in America are fed up with the darkness in the movies they don't want to feed their kids witchcraft or demonic stuff they don't want to they don't want to feed them New Age stuff they don't want to feed them that they want them to grow up and have a future even secular of good moral secular people don't want that stuff and guess what they're the ones who spend the money it's not the few liberals and the wicked people out there that like other wickedness they do they don't they're not the ones the moral majority in America is what goes to the movies and if you make it too ugly hateful damaging then they're not going to go and there's some cartoon movies how much are they making well let me tell you I can tell you the long range of which is dark in case you wonder they're suffering at this not good and Johnny Depp played in that movie he's a great actor we need to win him to cry I actually drove I his home and release the anointing into it I just as I did I know where some of those people live in Hollywood I am bushwhacking them that movie grossed eight million and I forgot how many tens of millions it cost to make it so they lost tens of millions of dollars the same weekend they release a kid's movie which was good it made 82 million and that shows you that's the way Hollywood is going they'll make a really good superhero movie and then the next time they make it they make it darker well you're the parents of 10 11 year olds don't want it darker they like it way it was the first time they made it right and then they make it darker and then they don't take them and then it's not making as much money so I stick to Hollywood actually go in the Beverly garland theater it's a it's a theater where the movie stars go and perform and do stuff and that's where churches ric reitz churches there and you must be come to speak to Hollywood the producers director scriptwriter screenwriter special-effects people they all attend this church and I have flat tell them if you don't change what you're putting out that you're gonna lose your shirt and then this this is the floor Trump was elected and I tell them I'm telling you there's coming a time when the hand of our government will not just put extend their hand to the believer but they will become a believer and then want righteousness and godliness in our country and it's going to start changing the hearts of some people and you better start producing better movies or they're not going to come because God is about to inhabit our country and many people give us out to him and you won't have a job anymore and I didn't care what they thought about that because it's already happening I said you better treat those scriptures a whole big difference in having peril in a movie for a child and having death know three or four eyo should have to watch something killing something else okay paral paral is one thing right you know they could kind of think they would know something's going to happen but to show them that happening is unexcusable it's inexcusable and it's not acceptable by the moral majority of America nor by the believers of America and and we have a more votes than you do and we have more money than you do and if you want to sell your movies you better change what you're doing and I was just as bold to them as I was when I was because I like to go to movies did you know God loved stories if all this whole thing with Jesus happened now they'd be showing movies he'd be showing movie instead of telling parables God started all that there are movies in heaven you don't you know you don't get to you don't have to worry about any ratings oh thank god amen exciting intense funny powerful movies that you can be in the movie or watch the movie you're going to sit down and watch it you go down the hall step in the door you're in the movie acting they're called reality theaters and it's the first place they took me when it took me to happen he said we're going to show you how to have fun and I use the old thing well I have fun when I'm with you I have fun when I'm in your presence I have fun going to all these meetings I have fun listen these powerful people I have fun worshipping egos I mean fun like a child and so they took me to the fun places like jello land in heaven the amusement park in heaven where you see all the aromas and you get to learn to fly like Superman you probably know what all your kids are doing they're living out there that's the first place they could have picked any place they're taking the throne room you know they could have done anything with me no they took me to the fun places because he wanted people know it is fun it'll rock you mean fun so much fun in heaven and so you want some of those things invented and put on the earth and that awesome and I also told these actors and actresses and if you want to use your gift you've ever going to happen because in hell you do nothing okay and he'll your gift won't be recognized it won't be honored and it won't be used you actually will have no life at all and haven't you exist to live and hell you exist to die die die die die die die over and over and over and over again so you want to die all the time or you want to live that was my short version of the gospel life and death live death which one do you that was simplified didn't take me ten hours to give it to them and actually many of them are really they're cop name people I can't give you their names because they have underground churches but I mean really and God is putting believers as very close friends to some of the top stars that we have now I know one of Tom Cruise's best friends they're a prophet that is speaking into his life God gave him those gifts he wants her gift and you know I used to complain a lot about the evil the witness he goes well don't you know they have a dark heart and even though I gave him that gift what comes out of their heart is what they will produce as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so if your soul is dark are that you will produce darkness he said but if I if their one to me that same soul they'll produce amazing powerful things in the movie industry so we need to see them from God's point of view right he doesn't want them he gave them a gift every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights which is what you were before you were here why would they say father of lice that doesn't make sense that doesn't mean the stars the moon and stars know the father of light he is our Father we are his offspring that meant you are a little spirit of light when you lived in him he was your world he was your only world and you would ride out on the Rays of the rainbow you jump into different colors your favorite colors even had favorite colors when you lived in him you jump on that favorite color that bandied right out as far as it would go and then when they come back and you drive back again you rode in and out of him all the time that's why you like blue or red or green you are connected to that when you were in him and then not only back did you have color all the stones of fire that had this blue fire burning that's his passion our God is they wot consuming it really is in him it consumes when we love him that love makes that fire shoot up around those gemstones inside of him which are the stones of fire that Lucifer used to walk on he stepped inside God and led worship how close was he to him and yet he became defiled God didn't do that God did not create Satan by the way people were making why did God make evil he didn't lucifer chose to be evil he doesn't create evil same to your changing by the moment every more revelation you hear you're getting changed your soul is taking this your soul is capturing it gets recorded it actually gets stored in your soul that's why I try to share as much as I can because it's storing in your soul it will start changing the way you think it will change the way you see him and yourself you came from that holy God he was your life he sustained you you didn't have to make choices even Adam lived in there Adam was the first he sent from himself when he breathed the spirit of life into Adams body Adam became a living soul because then Adam had to make his own choices and decisions he no longer lived in him does it show you a whole different way to see life he became a living soul and that spirit of life was you that's what you were that's what he was he literally was breathing Adam spirit man into that body and that's when life begins when the spirit is attached life begins a conception at conception that father sends a little spirit of life with the Holy Spirit who goes inside the mother's womb and attaches and knits it together to that tiny dot of flesh your spirit was then attached and that's when life began and they know and your spirit is made out of light and they found a few years ago the scientist did that at the time of conception there is a flash of light and they don't know why but now you know why because that was the Holy Spirit knitting you together in your mother's womb there's revelation on the word have all that he sent you from himself to live here to have a body because you can't have authority in this world without a body that's why Satan wants to possess them he himself just can't take over he would have already done it right he needs humans to be wicked and evil and do stuff that's why God needs us to be powerful on Justin righteous because we have more power and authority than they do those operating that way don't have all the power and authority they just don't mind demonstrating for the enemy they don't mind demonstrating is about time we stood up and demonstrate for God and God said there will be people that demonstrate manifest for him so so powerfully and the way they live their life that even physical enemies will fear them because of what's controlling them will be afraid of you it says that Satan will flee from you if you resist him if you put yourself under the hand of God and you resist him by the way that is a forward motion that's you running your race that you take an authority that you live in holy that you speaking heaven culture that you making the right choices with your will your soul prospering every time you do that you're pushing him further and further away from you until you become so dangerous he runs away from you that's what a believer is supposed to look like in this world and yet we were taught just to hang on for the rapture I'm thinking if God is so Palama again eight years old in church if you were so powerful if you're all knowing if we belong to you why are we supposed to hang on hang on to what if I was to live in you I thought we had power over them as much as cast out demons what is this hanging on to get rescued rescue from who because don't we have power over the devil why are we being rescued which movie rescuers we're supposed to help rescue people to know Christ is that right [Music] this is the way people should be speaking from here this is what the church is supposed to be saying we're supposed to train you to do the work of the ministry not train you to sit at home and be in fear we're supposed to train you to take authority over the weather because we're over the weather not under the weather Christ had absolute authority over the weather and we are joined ears is that right then we should all be operating like that stop telling people those horrible tornadoes in our area you better get in the cellar I'm not telling you not to do that I'm saying as you go down there take authority over them tell them they have to stop and you you actually this is like a progressive thing but if you don't start saying it and stepping out you're not going to have Authority you're not going to have it okay what if this is how you demonstrate you say something you declare something and even God God actually says command you me that you have not because you ask not that's like basic Christianity that's your basic Kingsman that's just having your mortgage paid and getting food in your mouth that's basic asking is basic declaring and decreeing because you know who you are what he gave you it gets established to you that's not you begging for it so we need to get out a baby Christianity I I use now it's okay to ask I'm not saying don't ask if you're still learning keep asking but start declaring things like I will not tolerate a storm is coming into my area all the time and tearing up the land and destroying people's homes I'm not participating by communicating counting everybody how horrible it is I'm gonna start saying what's going to happen that's taken authority over the weather that standing in the middle of parts dry land and commanding rain to come come into low pressure system to form over the area and beginning to rain a healing rain not a destructive rain that was given to us he didn't leave you here alone when he said I will never forsake you and I will never leave you he meant that yeah but he's waiting for you to say something he's waiting to you to declare something to decree something there's no king in any nation that can rule if they don't say something they have to they have to give commands to people to have to say what they want done this is going to happen here this will go here I want this run in here start living your life like that if you have lack you're just tell lack you're not participating with it anymore take it out the door and start calling in the wealth of the wicked start calling in more than enough supply extreme extravagant supply extreme extravagant finances then when you've been saying that for a while you say I demand extreme extravagant finances to come because my god said it was mine that I'm above and not beneath and I am NOT poverty that he became poor that I might be rich so I'm calling that in right now I'm making a demand for nay not demanding to god you're releasing in the atmosphere that draws it because you're ruling and reigning I know this is going to be hard on some of you but God Himself said kamini me he didn't say beg say Amen he wants to hear you say what is going to happen when you were so full of him it comes on anyway when you share with people did you know God made everything did you know you've lived in him do you know that you want you to prosper and be in health see you're saying it already but you're sharing it when you release it in the atmosphere and you say I am calling and commanding this to come to me because God ordained me to Evon I am his son I'm not a doormat he wants me to live above so I can prosper and help people you're not hurting God you're making him happy you're making him happy she says to bless them that curse you can say a blessing or you can actually bless people instead of cursing people that says something go buy him something give it to him Wow you're going to ruin the devil's day you'll become even more terrified if you start blessing people that are against you it is fun it's an awful lot of fun especially if you if you start saying wonderful things to them while they're cursing you huh because enemy wants to shred you you want to shred you he wants to wound you then he wants you to fight back then he's controlling you and the other person but when you get to the point where you refuse to fight back because you're you you participate with them when you do that by the way you died your flesh and say I'm going to act like God right now and when they're cursing you and thrashing you did you know you're wonderfully imperfectly made you know God has great plans for you do you know you're made in His image he wants you to know him so much and they're already their minds freaking out I don't think you heard me did you not hear and yet I pictured you got picture this here's a demon sitting here saying didn't you hear me curse you didn't you hear what I said because you're saying it and they're speaking it so when you stop not letting impact you that demon is powerless and he will begin to say leave Leave leave Leave leave because you're feeling that soul that person with life and hope and the anointing that's why you said blessing not curse there's always reasons why you said things because that makes you a weapon against the enemy's plans and pretty soon whoever's doing that is either going to stop of the gunman ask you and say how can you live that way how can you love me when I have treated you that way so you spoke something you seated something into them and one day that will open the door for you to share with them this is who we are I've had to do it many times in my life I had to make all those choices myself but the more I did it the easier it got until nothing penetrated me and all I would hear was what God wanted to say to them and what I was sharing was what he wanted to say to those people and then they would get undone they would get undone I actually could hear the demons screaming that is leave Leave leave Leave leave because they didn't want that person to be filled with life we had young people pull up to the convenience store I stopped to get something in order was I was waiting in the car my sister and they were all saying something about my hair by the way which is great ministry tool they roll the vicious interchange to roll the window man that hair is hot that hair is awesome you a rock star I would you think I would usually ask them a question instead I said well what do you think it is we think this is about do you like this do you think we should all be allowed to have hair like this yeah man that's awesome I said this is heaven culture and then a shock wave sits into all of them I said I belong to Jesus Christ he likes his pink hair and then they don't say to you are that they're still all stare at me wal that I know Jesus Christ and when do you really what does he say to you oh he speaks to you I said yeah they go well I go to church so that's good that you go to church I go to happen you think you can't minister with this stuff let me tell you what then every one of them are looking at me well what does that mean that means God loves you enough to catch me up to heaven so I can tell you about it you wear clothing that makes music and change colors okay they have extreme sports in heaven and you don't even have to wear helmets I start talking about the things they like and then they're all like the ones on this side car leaning over the other ones talked to me out of the window and they said well I I think God those people I think everyone's going to go to heaven I said well you know what I know God didn't God doesn't want that because would you want to go to heaven and have all the evil and wickedness and crime in heaven well of course I wouldn't I said then the whole earth can't go to heaven I said you hear about Jesus she said you knew him right yes I know him you know he died on the cross yeah he died on the cross I said you know that gives you power over the devil then everything changed there is no devil oh no there's no devil oh no he's not real he doesn't exist now there's no devil I said but I've seen hell and then they heard screaming there is no hell they have been to the church that taught them deception oh no everybody's welcomed by God everyone's going to heaven everyone but there's no devil we don't want to hear about that might you just talk about Jesus we want to hear about Jesus we don't want to hear about the devil can you just talk about that I said no because then you're not getting truth and the truth makes you free and then they were screaming let's leave let's leave Jen and I are like holding our hands releasing the anointing we were sending so much anointing in that car the demons were running out of the car they were waiting on their friend in the store they learn he went to the store and screamed get out of here get out get out get out and I said I didn't get my IC I can't no leave it don't get have to get out here because the demons were being terrified and they were being hurt by the words of a speaking because the truth will make you free and as they took off we sent all the hosts of heaven after them to pull down every stronghold of the demonic and their life just shred the platforms anything ruling I mean we with the whole host took after and they were discovered the car bushwhack I said some Graham on heaven was praying for them generous at that we were license our wheel kindly forgot what we went there for which it wasn't that amazing was a mystery that Mississippi in which it all started because in my hair it all started because my hair they were drawn to it it says have we gone to the light they just didn't know it would be P so heaven is fun and therefore if you're going to live heaven culture on this earth you have to have fun in your life I know we're all very you know a lot of people are so serious and profound about God and he's holy and you know they for some reason they thought he never had fun I don't know why if he said you must be like little children to enter into the kingdom of so why would he think he wouldn't have fun I think he'd be in a lot of trouble if we all showed up thinking like little kids and there was no fun to be had so he planned fun on purpose and it was there before it was here it was their first kid well you making heaven sound like yours no I'm not I make an earth sound like heaven only it's better I mean can you imagine being able to ride on a dinosaur they do didn't happen they ride on dinosaurs of every kind he ever made is there the devil did not make dinosaurs okay he cannot create life he can't he creates the opposite right he's the author of gasps not lies and so yes everything everything in heaven is alive the walls your wall speak junior mansion the crystal sea has a voice the trees saying the flowers sing the flowers dance with you the birds sing everything every every creature in heaven will sing and talk to you there's a place called the friendly forest where even the pebbles will jump up and down it says The Rock's cry out in heaven they actually cry out you sit down by a big boulder it'll turn its head and again to tell you how awesome the king of glory is it's in the word it says the trees clap their hand doesn't it it says the waters rejoice all that is in heaven to imagine going on a trip on these great sailing ships that it says in the word are there it says his great great sail ships that go across the crystal sea you're not just going on a boat ride okay you're going into glory clouds the whales come up and begin to worship God the whales come up the Sharks come up they worship God everybody on that ship begins to worship the lord of glory and then he comes walking across the water and you see these blinding like a million diamonds is what Christ looks like so it's got a million diamonds it gets closer and closer to you and then he dims that glory you see him face to face and you get lost in his eyes you get lost and that passion you have for you that love he has for you and for the first time in your life you'll know why he went to the cause nothing could have kept him from that but nobody made him go there he willingly chose to go there for us that's right so we have a way back to a father who we lived in at one time every baby that passes away is in heaven every single baby whether it was abortion what it was missed with him is miscarried whatever the reason they're all in heaven he has them all okay they're also living an amazing fun life even little even little tiny babies I've seen some this big about three four inches high they didn't make it all the way through birth and he has them in heaven he holds him in his hand and they play he bounces them on his fingers they grow little flowers this big whole fields of them so these little babies can run through them and pick them and they stick them in each other's hair and they're like sticking everywhere you know they make little bouquets and go take them to Jesus they climb in the Kangaroos pockets and go for hoppy rides they write on deer they swim under the water you've got play ponds for babies they write on the turtles and the goldfish under the water they slide down rainbow bridges into the water rainbows slides they're amazing it is wonderful isn't it everybody gets their baby back when they get to heaven most of the time he keeps them very little and they'll already know you they already know you right now they declare over you right now from heaven they're in love with you they love their parents and if they were aborted they forgive their parents they forgive the people who are involved in all of that Jesus fills their heart with his love and from that moment on they want them to come to heaven amen father we declare and decree that all father who gave up their babies who didn't let their babies come to full term we declare over them God that they will have a chance to know you that they be filled with your love and your life God they'll go to heaven and the very baby that very baby you sent down to him will be given back to them God to know them to play with them God to grow into their gift into the true destiny they won't miss that God because their destiny is to use a gift that you made them to be I declare it in Jesus name Amen everything that that brings hope for people's salvation because we are in agreement with heaven when we do that you need to be in agreement with heaven says over your family amen kids have an awesome time in heaven they get to ride in bubbles they have hoverboards even at age five they hop on hoverboards and go over heaven and some adults go I'm on they're not going to get lost okay they don't even have to have an adult with them how about that they're living a life of freedom of joy creativity with God amen they're enjoying yourself they still love you every child loves their parents to them it's like minutes have gone by minutes I tell the story of the time there was a couple that I think the son was about seven and he passed away and then 20 years later his mom was on an operating table and died and was caught up to heaven and she saw him still seven playing in the streets of gold and he runs up because bomb what are you doing here see still call her mom what are you doing here she goes what are you doing she goes what do you think I'm doing I'm playing with my friends I have friends I'm playing with my friends and she was so overjoyed and overwhelmed she just couldn't take her eyes off the beauty and splendor of heaven and here he was saying I think he was even either living with a grandfather with his long he was living with a family member in heaven he said that he was having an awesome time couldn't wait for to get there but he looked there he goes but you're going back and she didn't want to go back he says you have to go back mom your life isn't over you're not done your race isn't over you got to go back and she went back and then years after that her husband traveled all over the world and told that story that you will get your children God is keeping your children they're having an awesome time you're going to get them back when you go to heaven and so you don't even miss that you know God doesn't mean he didn't take your child away from you okay he's not the author of death he's the author of life I will say this to you if they ever got a choice if they were ever given a choice and God said you can stay and here they are looking at the one that they came from and you know that was your home you know that you know he was your home you you know your home is heaven you know your home here captivated by this Living God with life flowing from him literally life coming in and out of him you know he's got eyes flames of fire and he reaches out through all that glory and just grabs you and hugs you and this is one thing you know I don't think I could exist away from him if you haven't been there I've been there I know what that feels like you're consumed with wave after wave of this living love and glory and power and revelation is flowing into you by the second just standing in front of them and you're like how can i how can I leave how can I leave and then God says I have all of your family in my hand and and if you've declared over them on the earth if they're declaring over each other they're all going to make it here because my word says if you live if you abide in me and my word abides in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you and if they're standing for each other's salvation if they don't if they don't drop them we won't drop them and you'll pursue them as much as you possibly can to get them into heaven and those kids jump into his arms and they go I'm saying so if they had to make a choice you can't don't get angry at God and don't be angry with yourself they don't want you to waste your life doing that they want you to run your race make a difference in this life do great things for him because God has you in his hand he has gum in his hand and one day you'll never be away from them amen it's a hope it's a promise he gives us I know it hurts when they leave because you have the greatest salt I ever that powerful love makes a soul tie you're still connected to them in the spirit you know but they can hear and see you by the way everybody look up to heaven away hello it says your dog draw barking at you right now yoky are you cats army Alan there is a great cloud of witnesses if I'm telling you to look up and wait every now and then you are not doing ancestor worship when you waive it one another right now are you doing ancestor worship no but religious minded people will tell you that it is ridiculous do you blow kisses because you're not worshiping each other right you're expressing love Hebrews 12:1 and he was a had just talked about the great people faith who passed on to heaven they're talking about heaven since you're surrounded about by such a great cloud of say a witness can see in here so they can see and hear you from heaven it says run your race doesn't it get rid of everything that holds you back they keep you hell down so you can run your race because you're being witnessed so don't grieve ok I command all grief to leave everybody here I come in all fear to leave everybody here I command all confusion all deception to be broken off of everybody here in Jesus name everybody say I am free I have a future he holds me in his hand I don't have to listen to the insults or judgments of man I am who he says I am I am his child I've been called greatness to run my race with celebration with joy with wealth and with help that I received amen I'm going to talk a little bit about America before I end ok America has a great future it has one of the greatest futures except maybe Israel and one you know there's two main places on this earth that God focuses on all the time one is his roar one is America and I love telling this that God said he hit us he hit us in Israel and he even wrote it down je are us a LEM he meant it when he said that to me because the USA would be friends to Israel they would partner with Israel they would pray for the Peace of Jerusalem they would support the people they would back them by saying that is their land God gave it to them we love the same God worship the same God so he actually planned this partnership before he even made this earth so we have a great destiny to be the Friends of Israel and he said he didn't replace them people I didn't even know what replacement theology was I didn't even understand that what do you mean he didn't never say he replaced him ok we are grafted in because of them we can have a relationship with the Living God amen Christ came to die for the sins of this world and then he also came to give Dominion back to us that we had the right to live a powerful exciting life in this world as a believer amen they were supposed to bring life to people and hope to people and our country has a great future and I will tell you what the father said Trump will sit in that White House for eight years [Applause] we're all those who are unhappy here in this loose it from your soul because parents will sit in the White House as president for a year it's awesome that makes a total of 16 years for him he'll be around for 16 years he already looks presidential and he is a born-again believer is boring him seho daily Bible studies in the in the White House Bible studies and prayer meetings every day they hold them in the White House not because they have to because they want to and then the person that pen sticks as vice president will be president for eight years after him yes he is letting me prophesy 24 years of righteousness in the white house [Applause] which means prosperity safety blessing increase in inventions and creativity joy and celebration in our country God welcome back to our country that we can preach the gospel anywhere we want to we won't have any problem getting permits no one's going to sue us for things they're unreasonable because justice is coming back to the Supreme Court so even in this natural realm it is going to be great to be an American and God said I want you to stop focusing on the red or the blue I want you to be red white and blue and be an American okay don't look at the parties anymore we were created to be an American live in America being born in America because of what it stands for and so justice liberty and freedom is what our name is as what God calls America America is his gift and he refuses to curse it especially since the highest position in our land is saying himself god bless america [Laughter] whoa yeah [Applause] [Laughter] integrity is coming back to our country okay and we are going to be a power overseas in a good way we are already rescuing we're going to rescue nations that can't defend themselves we're going to be able to take the gospel freely because they will welcome us because of the change in our country there will be a time when there will be no terror in our streets because the devil won't want to be here and let's all say this together the ISIS is having a crisis they better give up because he won't stop or shut up nope the enemy I'm telling you the enemies of our country are going to know they're not our friends okay those who don't want Israel that don't like Israel that don't like America they better rethink their plan because we will be the ones who will be ruling and reigning with our God in this world shaking and changing shaping nations and shaking governments amen we will shift governments [Applause] we're having an all-american rally right now that's what we're having if anyone should have an American rally it should be the church and now we actually can the unrighteous love said you could not speak from a political platform in the church he is abolishing that Trump is abolishing now [Applause] just yesterday just yesterday people if you didn't know okay that was not wanted by the people this is what how do we say is no no where do we say America is for the people by the people right so our government works for us they shouldn't be telling us what we have to do they're not a dictator a man what we vote on is what counts what we want past is what counts right and it's always going to be good it's not going to be evil right but when things are forced on you that is an illegal law that was forced upon you and no more abortion and I want you to know that I said other countries are already being influenced by our president because about a week ago the leader of Poland stood up and said we're making a new law there will be no more abortions in Poland how about that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen how about that our president made a decision and it really is inspiring other leaders of all the countries to do the same thing no fear you're right they're actually there meeting with him as fast as they can to get wisdom and counsel from him because he has he has a plan to make our country great they want their countries great and he's given them sound advice okay they've never seen anyone as bold as our president [Applause] yes he is not afraid of anybody or anything he knows God put him in that position and he knows God doesn't like evil either and so he's going full steam ahead and I tell you what he will rid the ISIS from our country and I knew all the stuff before he even won four times face to face God the Father caught me up and showed me his plan for America and he said I have chosen him before this world was made I timed his birth on the earth the generations before him lay down their life for the day of my son's power and now Trump is willing in the day of my son's power he's willing to live this is the day of by the way if you didn't know what that's not the day of his wrath Jesus Christ has a day of his wrath but he has a Dave his power that he clearly talks about praying my people be willing in the day of my power is not the day of his wrath you couldn't even put him together at the same time the Davis powers when a manifest has sons and daughters that talk about in the book of Romans will walk on this earth when the greater works that Christ said we would do will happen on this earth when the wealth of the wicked will be given to us so we can use it for him on this earth I'm not talking about in heaven I'm not talking about the millennial reign I'm talking about right now and so he had to shift our government he had to shift it so that he would be welcomed right and so that the hand of our government would be extended to the believer instead of slapped crushed down pushed back stripped God out of our country by the way that's been going on for some time because the enemy every single time he could get in to remove something of God and nobody did anything about it but tolerated it and finally for the first time the body of Christ actually did something right even before the election they all started shouting your will your way in our government today your will your way on earth as it is in heaven your will your way your choice today and the millions of the body of Christ lay down their differences and started saying that and let me tell you being needed our voice to be so we needed to say something and we needed to passionately say it and we did we did say it god bless america now that is agreeing with it we he wants to do because he clearly says blessing don't curse right and there are people saying God's going to curse America it's going to fall off the face of the map it's going to split in half anarchy is going to be in the streets everything is going to be living in dumpsters they got body bags in Missouri for all the carnage it went on and on and what that stuff is coming from hell it is not coming from God because he birthed America himself he named it for himself the very first people who led someone to the Lord in this country were the Huguenots the Prophet Huguenots who came to America for religious freedom they were called the dancing Huguenots they were prophets they would spin and dance in the streets of France how about that they came to America they landed on the shore of Jacksonville while I live and that's why I live there and when the very first converts at Tim ik want Indians were one that the gospel of Jesus Christ and that marked this land they came to mark this land for the preaching of the gospel okay in st. Augustine they claimed this land for the Catholic Church and for Spain they did not claim it for the preaching of the gospel they did not want those people here but it was too late too bad they won the first converts they want they saying the first Christian Protestant song as they were coming ashore they carried with them a monument they made in France and brought this this concrete monument and I can see that Monument anytime I want to they plan to the on the land I said we're claiming this land for the pitching the gospel for Jesus Christ and on that monument is a huge shield when Michael the Archangel holding a spirit of Satan's neck who's on the ground so there's there's a lot of open heaven over the area I actually have been out there and I actually could hear the blood of the martyrs crying out saying who will take up our banner who will take take up our calls who will continue the preaching of the gospel to win this land for Jesus Christ they had a divine purpose and they're still declaring it there in heaven but it says the blood cries out amen and so they had a purpose for America and that was God's purpose also so they came here they listen to him they came here they fought through all kinds of persecution and all kinds of things on the ocean but they came they did what he asked him to do and I'm going to own a house on that land where they came ashore one day meant I want to be where heaven came ashore and so I'm glad that I lived there but you know what God is pouring on his spirit everywhere he's got such anointed places I will tell you I do not care what they're saying and the voices of the people in Colorado I don't care what the proclaiming what they're saying is legal is illegal to God with the saying is right is wrong to God he's not going to permit tolerated because because this are going to be a region of like yeah [Applause] yeah we're in agreement with that a man you can have regions of light all over America this is part of the future that he showed me back in 1998 yeah this is how long I knew this stoppers can happen okay he sure to show me stuff in 1998 when I got baptized with fire it was powerful it burns the world out of you it will burn fear out of you it will make you bold the fire will make you bold it's hot it's mentioned in the Word of God there's one coming after me who will baptize you where the Holy Ghost and with fire and I'm telling you I haven't been the same since even since then but he began for two weeks after that happened I had open visions of the future and I saw what was going to be actually what's happening right now in America I saw that so even before the whole Trump campaign before ever that even started I knew there'd be a time that the hand of our government would be extended to us I knew they would shift our entire government and our nation and so we've been shifted okay God said I'm going to put my hand on that map and turn it red and he did he did everything he said he was going to do and if you go back and listen to that stuff everything he told me to say he's going to do it he is going to have his way this is his time when the kingdom of heaven is coming to this earth and living in us and we're living heaven culture on the earth and let me tell you your lives won't be the same again even the word Christian won't mean the same thing this is the day of his power when the generation will taste of the powers of the Millennial age and do all those powerful things that the generations before us paid a price so that we could do them a mint and it will spread all over this world because it says the knowledge of the glory will cover this earth like the waters cover the sea so none of those other nations are going to escape being touched by the Living God amen you're right all of those nations let me tell you God is definitely marked Italy I was there when he marked it he sent me to the Vatican and to do something in the spirit and he sent me to the Colosseum to declare stuff and in the spirit that was going to be there's always been a shockwave sent to that country and anytime God marks something something starts to begin you're going to see evidence in the physical realm you're going to see the enemy being stirred up because he knows his days are numbered okay and I do know this and every Catholic might shiver when I say this but there will be a time on this earth when they don't worship Mary [Applause] he told me he told me there'll be a time there'll be a pope that will have my ear and there will be a pope that declares that forever how long that lasts I don't know how long it'll last that they will not worship Me oh they'll worship Jesus Christ they'll honor Mary but they will not worship her and so there's major I'm saying major changes coming to this world major changes coming to this world I'm not saying all evil will be wiped off but it's going to be like pushed back even into certain regions where people will go just to sin or commit crimes but you'll get to choose between life or death light or darkness and so this is what we're headed you God is going to clearly define and people will know who they serve they're going to know what they're going to know who they serve and nobody will outshine the body of Christ they'll not out think out do not even in sports not in business not in any arena with a I'll do with the body of Christ we'll begin to display and manifest for God on this earth and then people will want believers as their friends instead of the way it is now people how different will be it will be drastically different and at the end of that 24 years it won't be the same country ok it will not be the same country God said people will hear the word America and they will thank God [Applause] they will think Jesus Christ helping God they'll come here to find him not that they can't find him everywhere but there'll be so much God in our country and so many believers standing up and manifesting for him that they will come here to find out what is it about that country so hang on to your hat I know this is it we're going to get on that wild rollercoaster ride but we won't be in fear of ever falling off we will enjoy the ride as something new this coming is that children will actually be honored and respected they be looked and sought-after for wisdom because God's going to give little children wisdom that even adults don't have they'll speak things and they will happen because of the purity of their hearts they won't be looked at as someone just to babysit people who take care of children will be some of the most sought after if you could prove that you who are righteous you know and you haven't committed crimes and stuff you will be paid a lot of money to watch and care for children because they will realize how precious they are how important they are to God amen I literally saw children ten years old being the pastor of huge churches because they lived righteously they can try to reason everything away that God was saying I mean mass healings were taking place manifestations of heaven were happening because children have pure hearts so they will be looked at as a soul being shaped for the future which is what they are I mean children are a blessing isn't that way sad children were sent as a blessing he would have sent them if he didn't want to if you didn't intend for them to do things on the earth he sends them he has to send them right they all live in him but his intent was to make this time-space planet he made it so he could send them from himself that's it give you another view of the earth because he wanted us to have flesh and in order to do that his son had to have flesh put on him the word didn't have flesh and yet he created everything that we see and that that we don't see he made it yet he had to walk as a human on this earth that was a big stretch talk about a stretch by the way he became poor when he left heaven by heaven standards he was poor when he left there by earth standards he was never poor what came to him to bring him the gold and all the spices and the oils it was caravans it wasn't one camel with one little package it was caravans these wise men these kings three from three different countries travelled for two years and brought all their food their tents their servants their servants food there's camel's food and they travel for two years with all the supply plus carrying wealth for the Son of God and what they gave Joseph and Mary actually could have provided for them for their entire life so when they went into Egypt they didn't have some hovel they had some of the best homes with the best tutors for Jesus to teach him they had the best garments so he was raised in that way he is the one who was living here as his father his earthly father was a master carpenter who was recognized in the city gates and remembered generations after he died is he not Jesus the son of Joseph the carpenter they didn't remember lousy carpenters back then you don't remember lousy carpenters but if somebody did a good job you always remember them because you use them over again right so even the one you gave him to train him and his gift Jesus was a master carpenter he was sought after all the time in the city especially by wealthy people because they only wanted the best carpenters to make their furniture and build their homes so you can't tell me he did not have money he was in demand he was invited to all the weddings because he always brought furniture as a gift and the water he turned into wine the wine remember that turn the water into wine it was heavens line it wasn't earthly wine it's a nice miracle to turn it into earthly mind it's a greater miracle to turn it into heavens wine so what they served at that wedding they had never had anything like it in their life it was better than I ever had before was because it didn't come from this world there's another there's another whole thing for you to see another viewpoint for you to see the whole thing the first miracle he did was he brought heavens wine to earth he still brought heaven to earth for a party amen so Sistina I'm going to declare Oh everybody and then we're going to end ok I will be back I'll be back yes when God offers you something you should always say I receive it and let me tell you why you should say that because he writes it down when you say that he records all the time he records your words amen you're moving and when you get to heaven you will know everything you helped to change throughout your lifetime you know every person you impacted every nation everything that went on you know how many times you stopped hell ok you beat up hell with your words you just you went every every time you choose God over hell every time you choose what's right all of heaven celebrates so you cause heaven to celebrate you cause hell to cry you terrify their enemy you get him upset he thinks you're nuts because he can't figure you out in other words you drive him not that that's why we should take seriously what he says in the word right declare and decree it will be established unto you right you're over the weather you have authority over the weather over the earth itself over the atmosphere you change the atmosphere with your words you create the atmosphere in your home a habitation for heaven - you do it yourself by the choices you make with your will because your soul is powerful even as your soul prospers you will prosper and live in health so there is a requirement people I remember everybody would say Oh God wants us to prosper the word says he desires above all though we prosper but they never said what was required and so I turned that around even as you hear the requirement first even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in hell that's a lifestyle so we can be rich because it became poor we can be in help because our soul prospers every time he said there would be that is a state of existence so your will be done on earth that is in heaven is a state of existence yeah that's heaven culture amen so you be hearing more that but I'm going to declare a blessing over everybody here Amen father I choose as an act of my will father operating in the authority you gave me then I'm going to clear freedom freedom hope liberty justice for every wrong gun to them justice over injustice father I declare restoration for all their families for their jobs for the well restoration in their help god I speak against every spirit of infirmity every spirit of sickness every spirit of disease every spirit of any care father that is not having culture so come against it right now I pull down to the hosts of heaven i commission pour on the stronghold of sickness of disease of infirmity father pull it down for them shred it crush it I seek liberty freedom health wholeness and void and everybody's body and your mind and your motions and Jesus name I declare it say I receive it amen amen [Applause] and father I declare the over everybody watching God everybody receiving a God let it be important them I declare over them I blessed him with it father I thank you in Jesus name everybody said yes amen yeah God hallelujah

we understand the greatness of heart we are grateful for bringing you we thank you for the things that you're doing deep inside of her and you've been doing deep inside of her for this point in time this divine time in Colorado for all those that have come through others from other states and even at some other nations yes other nations Canada we ask that you would just help us all to put aside everything of this day any weighty things any things that have happened in this day and Lord we're here we've made it and those that are watching by livestream the same those are watching by Facebook live just go into a place of just but aside everything that you were here that we will hear clearly what you're saying to us the church in this hour for those that don't know you Lord that you're gonna speak to them specifically today and that you will reveal heaven to them in a way they have never seen or known or really thank you that you will be honored Lord Jesus Father that you will be

mightily we thank you all for coming and sister we are ready both barrels okay love you cat good to have you welcome everybody welcome cat [Applause] well welcome amen um can you hear me yes somebody put it on whatever I'm real excited I always love coming here the atmosphere is so powerful you know I'm I'm telling you there are so many so much of the Angelica's around here always but there's always an increase and that is a good thing when I come back to a place and there's an increase and heavens armies or even just game roles and messengers describes the couriers you know as is that me making that sound oh tight what my mind disconnects oh it's okay I'm when the 15 it really doesn't matter you never had privacy in your entire life you knew it was never gonna be about you trust me just surrender and love them all in the middle but they do it yet and when you learn to do that really your life is gonna be so simple because you're not everything to be concerned of what people think about you is that still me is that my scarf how's that yes okay yes yes well one day I'll be standing up here speaking and then I'll be gone but I'll be right back the father's really been showing me a lot about the greater works and really what a true manifested son and daughter is and why did he even pick those titles he didn't want to call you you know it's not that you're not someone's husband or wife or family member but but the father sees us always as his sons and his daughters that's why when you go to home to heaven you get your own mansion just don't say no okay you will love it you'll be undone and you know what your family can come stay with you for a while then you can stay in theirs and and people do that a lot in heaven you know they just go visit each other's mansions even if someone's gone just go on in heaven and have a wonderful time there because no one's gonna care they're not worried about their stuff being stolen or taken or damaged they're so free and heaven I think one of the earmarks of heaven culture being lived on the earth as we will feel that free about things and though in the realms that we live in I'm you're gonna hit me say realms and zones a whole lot because that's how the father talks to me they don't have like areas or districts or you know they don't have like earth titles in heaven but heavens about to send a lot of those titles and positions down here and so the territory in heaven is marked out by zones and realms and realms can be layered if you've never heard me talk about the father and even the way he may mean I'm making this remark because of an email i got i don't usually even get to see them because there's like thousands of them that come to me but i just happened to see me laying there and it was to me and i read it and they totally didn't understand even about the soul that it's made it is in three parts god has made your entire being in layers your body has layers your spirit man has layers and your soul has layers because god's not just up you know one level one whatever god he's he's always deeper and has more things that he releases into us and ways to use us and so he didn't make you just like a block of wood it's the best way I could describe he didn't make you you you're not made just like in one way you have so many parts in you that when you really begin to connect with what each one of those mean and how to use that you will become more more powerful in him he'll be able to do more with you and for you so just want to encourage people step beyond your head knowledge when you're when we're talking about spiritual things because even the spirit realm itself has layers I'm here to do spirit round boot camp hey what is that something you've almost known nothing about your entire Christian life unless you yourself are a seer or you have a maybe God has shared deep understanding of what the spirit realm is but I've been in and out of that it's probably more than even around on the earth even on the roads and highways I mean we have roads and highways SPMS roads and highways and has waterways that has Airways frequencies light you travel on light in the spirit realm but if you could see like super highways going like this everywhere all the time intertwine we sometimes in spirals someone's like that and like sheets of light coming down and taking you places there's more activity in the unseen realm then there is in the scene realm because it is the original realm you're in a temporal realm but you're a supernatural being as a new creation you know one day our bodies will be glorified you'll go from mortality to immortality if you don't know what that means that means you can never sin never die never get sick never fall from from his from the position God's given you and nobody can take anything away from you that like on the earth God says watch out for your crown that no man take it from you so I'm just gonna I'm going to drop little scriptures in between while I'm talking here tonight but I'm really here to let you understand how real that realm is to me it is more real than the natural realm heaven itself is a spiritual world wrapped any spiritual realm but spiritual beings living there it is a literal realm it's the only way you can say it you can't say it's a physical realm you know you can't say that it is a literal realm when you live a real life like you really go into your mansion you touch the walls you sit on the furniture you know ride on beams of light around heaven create rainbow bridges by shouting glory to God across a crystal sea you you travel on light frequencies color billions of the rainbow God sends himself to come and get you twirls around you and brings you back to his throne to spend time with him it's a different way of life heaven culture is totally different than the way we live here because we're living below what he always intended us to be and do and if we keep remaining disconnected from that spiritual place on the unseen place this is the time on earth where the unseen will be seen and not just by the body of Christ but by those in the world all over the world and I have news for you the knowledge of the glory will mostly go through the spirit through the spirit realm travel in and out instantly be somewhere go share release and power people then step back and be somewhere else in a few more seconds that's what the Angels do if they're sent on an assignment takes like three seconds are done it can be somewhere on the other side of the world instantly they're there they'll deal with the army of darkness you know bash them really crush them throw them in a dry place shred platforms they've been ruling from for years pull down strongholds and 3-seconds be back because the reason why we need to be connected or at least start with an understanding that place is real it's a way of life it does not belong to Satan or the New Age movement 4 years old we heard about was you know the New Age movement doing this and that and things would appear and disappear and they would shape-shift and go places and that's just mocking what God has always intended us for us to do but for good the disciples did it it's part of heaven and we all say Heaven's coming to earth what does that mean that means your life's gonna radically change many things are going to end in your life and you're gonna be done with them because the more the old you get rid of your habit your thoughts and your mindset that through man's traditions we have adapted to it because it's comfortable I do not ever want to be comfortable again I don't want to be boring nor do I want to be bored so the body of Christ is lacking heavily an understanding of that unseen realm but they know it's there so God's giving detailed revelation what is it how do we operate in it what does it look like what does it do to this physical realm where does this talk about that and the word what did Christ do in that what are the Angels doing that what does war look like in the heavenlies the heavenlies isn't talking about the sky over your home they warn that unseen place okay this physical realm is wrapped around the spiritual round not the other way around it's wrapped around it because it's temporal it's like you it's like you had this beautiful home perfectly built and amazing but you put a cover over it and yet it was yours you owned it it was yours you had the Builder you have it living it use it enjoy it be blessed by it and yet we're only seeing a covering like what we have now is like owning a tent because it's not a true true picture of what God has prepared for us to have to own to operate with many places like in heaven when you die and go home to heaven you don't get one mansion Jesus didn't say you get one he said there are many many many many many many more than I could ever count I've seen a mansion several now they're the size of a whole city like the city of New York order the city of Atlanta anywhere one mansion and all that property everything on it belonged to one person probably probably one of those grandma intercessors you don't really know what she did in that closet they're probably times when she wasn't even there she looks we think ah she just stays in that closet she probably wasn't in the closet especially if you pray in tongues a lot there's a clue for you the unknown language for the unseen realm they kind of go together don't they Satan hates that language he's trying to crush it you know wipe it out wrongly accuse that wrongly accuse us we're doing it because he's terrified of it he can't understand it he doesn't know what you're saying he just knows it's dangerous against him it's part of the spirit realm heavenly language heaven unseen realm a heavenly language the unknown language in the unseen realm where the devil does not like it it's always gonna be bad for him when he hears people praying it because it's the perfect prayer why because you're totally agreeing with what's in that spirit realm and the unseen around with the unseen beings who were so powerful God's unseen plans for us who are his new creation won't be gonna when you begin to pray that passionately and fervently you move things and shift things in the spirit one that will then shift things in the earth we need to really see that this is it's a real is something that's real you mean of you know touch it but sure can feel a sometimes can't you I've been talking a lot lately I think I think I've had like 80 meetings this year I probably got a lot more before the end of this year because people are finding out there's something new in the earth it is self is not new more ancient than we ever will be I love hearing people talk about having encounters like tonight about people seeing the squirrel room in heaven and or the mantle Hall of Mantle's God names everything he loves she named things when you go home to heaven you get a white diamond not a white river rock with a new name written on it did you say a white stone that's a gemstone yeah we get one and he's writing this new nickname he has for you that only you and he know when you come home to heaven he gives it to you but that's a white diamond and every syllabus I've ever seen that talked about that it was like a nice little River Rock no it's not upon this rock that's the rock of Revelation the rock of love those are gemstones that's what's inside the father the stone of fire are in him that's why he is a consuming there's much of the word that actually confirms itself if you just read a few scripture that doesn't make any sense to you find the ones that connects with and then you get revelation out you go why you see it so plainly and clearly but you have to pursue that so the one thing the father even says that the body of Christ is lacking is is understanding of the unseen realm even though he said everything that is seen was made by that which is unseen so we should have been pursuing what is that unseen what does that look like what goes down there you'll find out when you go to heaven someday maybe he won't die to go there somebody should be saying Amen God is no respecter of persons Elijah and Enoch look more amazing than anyone I've seen in heaven and look how long they've been there in their bodies you hear them before you see them that you hear the frequency of the glory they carried you hear it you hear them before you see them everyone in this room has a frequency you decide whether the volume goes up or down every plant every animal has frequencies in them the enemy can also hear these frequencies say they're unseen say it loud they're unseen but they impact things so you need to learn how to turn your frequency up some people may be sitting going where is this coming from I've never heard of anything like this before my life but it's in the word it's in the word how many people this first time you've ever heard me speak okay well help them Jesus and I hope you like pink hair because it's heaven culture say on earth as it is in heaven I need to think about changing my parents to line up with having culture we will be some of the most radical people in this earth in the past I know God hid us I was hidden for years and years and years I had all kinds of encounters did things new things but he hid me he wasn't letting me say anything to anybody and I didn't have a problem not saying anything if he's asking you to hide something don't say it but he's asking you to say it don't hide it right obedience is very key in this time and I know a lot of scriptures to talk about obedience especially the joy of obedience yeah when you hit the joy of obedience there's no longer consequences if you disobey because disobedience isn't in you it's not in your soul there's not there's not a place in your soul for sin for a fence for disobedience because the new creation is like Christ say Amen you have to stop letting the devil push us around and telling us who we are he knows full well who we are and he's terrified of us and I don't remind I don't mind reminding him of that he even tries to say something to me ago you are just revealing the fact that you're 10 purified or you'd be trying to make that statement to me that you know I'm not receiving it don't waste your time we should speak both II for God and you might you can speak boldly even in a quiet voice that doesn't mean everyone has to be sound like me but you need to live like I live you want to be free of everything if you want to be victorious if you want your soul to prosper if you want to live in divine health if you want to not be attacked by the enemy I live heaven culture I've been doing it now every single day of my life for four years and my life changed when I started doing it because what God is bringing to this earth is not another revival man has always controlled the revivals when they first started they were powerful you know why it was all God they would let him have his will his way and that's why it was it would be extreme sometimes and the manifestations of the miracles and the things that happened and to me and started getting their hands all over at they thought they could make it better or they could make it happen here but not over there then we want to do this and change this and pretty soon it was like gone it did a lot of good while I was there but man can get their hands on something that happens in a specific place if it only happens in a place in a certain building or in a certain piece of property or even in a certain city like Toronto or Brownsville or Lakeland those who are areas that were saturated with the revival and every one of them ended by getting their hands on and yet what's gonna happen now he's not a revival it's much better he's not reviving something old but he will build on it he's not wiping it out like it never happened but some of those people who did that they're in heaven are waiting on their rewards by the way we live our life down here what we're getting habitation revivals em they ever you know they flow the Evan fold in flow and then they go a habitation builds and builds and builds becomes more apparent more seen by people more understood sought after what is this your life is changing why are these amazing things why is the glory all over your home why can I see it driving down the road three miles from your home why does he flames the fire on you when you're walking around well you just got up why are there flames of fire on the seat you just sat on because you're inhabited by the glory we will wear the glory like a garment I used to tell Jesus I want to wear you like a garment see I never said anything normal my mom told me every day my life I was strange you are so strange I don't know what God will do with you and whatever he wants to when you're part of a tribe of 15 you want to be different over just tell him I want to wear you like a garment I'm putting you on right now and I will just go out you know but I caught Jesus and I would think his thoughts and and run after his ways and then it began to not be able to take him off he wasn't just a garment anymore it was the glory and that glory builds it says we will shine like the stars in the heavens it said even the night will be light running about you yes that's exactly what that means it is a spiritual substance from the spirit realm from a spiritual God for his spiritual Kingdom but if we don't even know what that means how can we run after it because we've heard forever and ever and if say it forever and ever and ever we have gotten our three scriptures or two song and went home totally unchanged but that's not what you wanted he said we go from glory to glory to glory that does not mean from the glory to the pit the glory to the pit where am I going the glory to the pit know where the glory to the pit that's not even that's not a witness that's certainly not a good testimony and I know that the word says you overcome and the word of your and love unless oh I love that part from my mama her friend sitting over there and she said hello to you she loves you my mama just went to Saskatchewan Canada with me yeah she had a lot of fun she's praying for people couldn't help it she's talking next moment I see her laying hands on people bringing from home what you're supposed to be enjoying and relaxing she goes I am so we have to understand really who we are you are a spiritual being you always have been before the earth was made you were in him you didn't have a mansion in heaven to live and he didn't say you know he didn't say way back when you had a mansion we lived in and there's nowhere in the violets who actually lived on the earth in a different body you didn't have a body you couldn't have lived on the physical earth without a body and had any kind of authority or do anything because this is a physical realm and if you don't have a body you have no authority here if the devil that were true that you had authority in the spirit and your spiritual body the devil would have totally taken over and wiped out anything he could that was left of God but he can't do that that's what he wants us to come us and then he inhabit us and then he has a body there are no zombies I hope that doesn't disappoint you no aliens no zombies people keep me emailing me the craziest things I don't know where the aliens are except me right here if you believer you are also an alien we are the aliens that's in the Bible to Raelians we're not on this world we're in this world a temporal world don't cry when he folds it up like a garment what's gonna happen to me where will I go who cares you were the one who made the first one I think I would trust him to make the new earth where he will climb on the New Jerusalem and move from his home called heaven to live on the new earth with all of us together it will be our home he's even willing to give up his home his house his house is the world called heaven a spiritual place it's good to know about spiritual things and someone although that word in today's world could mean many things even the word faith could mean many different things so heaven culture they can't take that away from us they don't even know what that is they don't even know what that is the devil had no idea that one day we would be living on this earth like they live in heaven free from him free from fear free from black free from sickness disease free from aging I receive at people like there that is nowhere in the world you need to read it more than because the last age and this earth before he folds out all the way will be the Millennial age when Christ in his glorified physical body super glued to his spiritual body I told me that's what immortal means no more mortal flesh it's immortal flesh and Christ looks amazing in his immortal body he will sit on the throne in Jerusalem for 1,000 years on this earth so don't believe people they say the end is here and we're leaving the earth is going to explode by Planet X I don't even know what that is is something out there in space they found it and then what no that's not in the Bible for right now you know I'm not what do you do about Planet X I'm nothing I'm gonna go shopping after you buy my clothes so I'll go speak bar places I am NOT concerned about the CERN you probably don't know who they are you don't need to heaven is not concerned about the CERN or the Nephilim or planned attacks not even the rapture which will be a celebration not a rescue party if if that was gonna be a rush key parties say until I come back hiding in the mountains and eat the worst thing you've ever had in your life c-rations preach the gospel to the raccoons and the bears but don't go out because it might be dangerous no he didn't say that he never told you to even be concerned about the rapture he doesn't even know according to the word Jesus Christ does not know when the rapture will take place you know why because that's not on his priority list right now ruling and reigning commanding the hosts of heaven crushing the planes of darkness pushing back create regions of glory handling the wealth of the wicked of this world being the heads of all the seven mountains being out front not behind being accelerated to the front of the pack where people will know you and want to know you and see you and want to know what you have to say in other words I said he's not hiding you anymore he's going to reveal you like a fine painting that he's been working on for years even when you thought you forgot about you you got stuff spilled on you was a mess it looked like a big mess that was buried under stuff no the whole time he was working on you knowing what you would become one day for him so we're pretty much like wrapped around a big art gallery right now on the earth she's about to reveal some of the greatest paintings he's ever made that's us and we won't be able to hide I love what he said to me when you've stepped into this new time and you're running after it you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape being great so if you want if you want a prophetic word there's your word you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape being great what do you think the greater works are because people go it doesn't say that in the Bible do you realize in your manuals for to operate your microwave it has more than five words printed on a page and the Bible also does not talk about microwaves we may have find out they're not so good but we've been using them is that true most of what you have our own isn't mentioned literally in the Bible it says knowledge will increase it says things will be created in the earth there be greater works than ever before even greater than Christ did that that when a manifesting sons and daughters walk upon the earth the earth itself will be healed by the glory that's why the earth is in travail it doesn't mean the end and it means the end of the way we've all been living way below what God wants us to and so why does he say be great because you will be known and seen operating in power and authority really to the point where Satan flees from you because you've submitted yourself under the hand of God and you are resisting him with your forward motion in the kingdom instead of hiding sitting down hoping nobody sees you or knows you get over that because he's gonna pick people out in front he wants you to stand up and stand out why because Satan's been doing it for generations he's been showing up who he is all the people he's marked and he's used they don't mind showing off so God the habitation will be a show case you wondered the biggest show on earth is about to be played out on this earth by us because we are his sons and his daughters he had the first big show it was held in heaven when he kicked out Satan and all one-third of the angels that was a show they were celebrating trust me they weren't crying Lucifer decided to take over they were so fed up with him by the time God kicked him out they were celebrating the other angels the Fallen ones may have been crying I'm sure they thought they were gonna win just like this last election deception deception can deception will deceive the deceiver those who were used to spread lies yes I'm going to the political platform God is very political God has his own parties called the holy party they have a platform crush the darkness and rule and reign push it back don't tolerate it don't participate it don't participate with it be a new creation shine like the stars in the heaven that's their platform I want that one it's light not darkness all those angels thought they were going to win because God had said nothing the whole time Lucifer was deceiving them he let every single one of them be tested they only got to choose once out of chose real carefully they can't repent and they can't go back he will not take them back they live with him they believed a created being over the Creator where they had been with him if there was time it would have been ages they knew who God the Great Creator was they knew who the word was they knew who Holy Spirit was they knew they were in charge and this this being thought he was taken over and he he actually convinced them that he was because God would say nothing the whole time he was doing it that's God's mo share my will my way show my plan sit back see what happens Darden showed up he kicked it out he was cleansing heaven forever and they cannot repent they cannot ever go back to him they were unseated and lost their place because they chose deception and the thing about deception is if you've listened to it long enough you will actually enter into it and then you will try to deceive people with the same deception you got and you can't tell people they're deceived unless there's a divine intervention unless there really is a divine intervention or they have an encounter with God if they've been living that deception so long and saying that non-stop every time they say it it goes in their soul it convinces their soul even more it filled their soul filled their heart their mind everything they thought about was the deception then they acted it out by talking about it and rebelling against what was truth and it happened so much in this last election never have I ever seen the soul show up that was deceit and they don't know what to do they don't they don't know how to go back many of them can't go back they can't even be who they were before because when your soul gets filled with it you become that and they still can't get it I recently was in five different countries international countries and while I was there none of these people knew me that approached me but they figured I was an American when do I and they all asked me the same question what do you think of your president and I knew it was in her thoughts already knew they were for him not against him but they didn't tell me that I said I won't tell you what I think I'll tell you what 80percent of America things I said we love him we back him we believe that he really cares we know he's gonna make changes because he's already already created a million jobs in less than a year and so he's really proven and gods actually gonna have me give him that message I just gave you sent it to his son Donald Jr tell your father this is what God says about him you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape making America great and it will be sighed the Living God because he's running after it fiercely running after him regardless of the mum barment sand the words that have come against him he won't let it penetrate him he won't let it touch him and and other leaders of other countries are taking notice because these five international people they were like one was a medical moments a surgeon him and his wife were both brain surgeons I think they had lived in Canada but they had just been in the Middle East getting more training and I was on a tour bus in Italy and he told his wife I'm gonna go sit by her she said okay she must be used to it and he was the first one who asked me that Elmo would you mind tell me what you think about your president and I could see his wheels I see like little flags on Trump Trump Trump Trump in his mind like I guess yes because I look pretty happy and that's what I told him I'll tell you what 80percent of America thinks that I am I said they have lied the other side the liberal media have lied from the very beginning because they were controlled by the enemy and darkness they didn't want God anywhere they wanted somebody and even even some of the Republican hierarchy that have been around for a long time have controlled for years years and years and years control they want someone they could control and the same thing of democratic said they didn't want someone who could run over them or beyond them they want a puppet so God needed someone who was not a puppet and I'm actually telling this secular person this I'm telling what God said about him he was loving it well I'll tell you right now we like him we were rooting for him all along and I said he said I don't usually pray I was really praying he would win [Laughter] and he said he said I had to ask you because what we're hearing on the news it just doesn't line up because the people are always still there whatever he goes that people are there and when he's reporting on his own public Facebook page which they all watched then he went there to find out what was really going on and their armies meticulously was about letting the American people know what was going on and he said we were really for him he said I have hundreds of friends and we were all kept having conversations about him saying why are they saying he's losing why are they saying that that doesn't even make sense in our head when we see the rallies and we see tens of thousands of people there and the other side had a handful if they had if they have one and I went because they were afraid they're afraid of somebody who really would get something done and that would do what the people wanted done because it's for the people by the people and I said and he's a people I said he's a people he's not a politician so he was overwhelmed and overjoyed he said I know even when I was in Canada they were all talking about him because they said whatever happens in America happens in Canada I just got back from there they are still cheering him on they want a killer to become like America now they want Canada to be free to be prosperous did not have liberality on every single street corner crushing the rights of believers or just everyday people they were saying just everyday people you know they don't have a life it's controlled so they're all praying that other the one out of there or else he gets changed and let me tell you they have behind the scenes people who are grassroots strong believers coming up in that line and I actually might driver what I was there was one of those people who has actually already run one one of the minor elections and his goal is to become Prime Minister strong strong strong believer he has a huge following and again it's almost the same there that the news that our theater spirit is not telling the truth and so let me tell you they're running after God being in their country so they kept prayin you know the leaders are praying trumpet when yet the businessman was also kind of praying he would win because they have big business deals with our country and they want businesses left to do business with and so it was really strange that I have one ask you in in Spain and France in Germany and Canada someone from London it was and they all asked me the same thing in different places on different days but when they started looking at me one here comes the question and they all said what do you think about Trump I mean I think God chose him I think God appointed him I think he anointed him I think he's gonna do exactly what God wants and I'm just letting you know to have some good news he'll be there for eight years and then pants and then whoever pence picks will be there for eight years so I will tell you from the Creator the heavens in earth there will be 24 years of righteousness in the White House and I said whether you understand what I'm gonna say this is a spiritual war a spiritual battle not a natural battle this is a spiritual battle because it's very clear to see there is good there's evil there's darkness there's light but in this time light winds I said God you made this earth has a plan for this earth and this habitation he's bringing I don't care who they are and you would not talk to them the habitation is coming of God in us being seen around the world new creations like fuel from outer space that will cost almost nothing then they were really getting excited I said many new inventions would she say for this very time that we're living in you will see them happening and so then if you can ask people what are those inventions they didn't care who it was they didn't care if I was preaching the gospel town about Jesus you know why because hope was in that message but every one of them as same question I said well this is God's time this is why it's happening I know anyone but this is God's plan do you find people in leaders who can't be bought sold shaken or used that actually want justice and freedom and some of them may be believers some may not be believers but I really believe God's gonna get them in the end there has to be a time when this earth is experiencing that and the gray area says there is no God is erased and sometimes you'll just use secular people people who are not believers but let me tell you if they still hang around long they're gonna become one so we as believers even more than the world should understand there is a spiritual realm there is unseen activity from both sides in that place is actually unseen buildings and properties that are created in the spirit realm to be used as Satan uses song the host you some the Gabriel's group uses some of them and that activities always happened but in this time we're gonna begin to see it and you actually drive into an area and you'll feel God you feel his presence so powerfully sweeping to your car sweeping to you sweeping to the office where you're working because a region of light is being created in the area because of the habitation of our God in us because Christ in us is the hope of glory that's a powerful statement but understanding what that means is even more powerful and the wonder of it all and she doesn't really care about your education or your age even where you live what color your skin is what kind of food you eat or don't fit or don't eat you know and I'm just gonna give this from heaven for free on trial the Holy Spirit says this tell them that you don't have to be baptized in the Holy Spirit or baptized in water or go to church every single day of your life or necessarily even pay ties that is not those things won't take you to hell but those are being preached you give because you want to give when you give it shall be given unto you when you honor the Lord with your 10percent he'll do more that 90percent probably double it triple it than you ever could do with that 100percent it is a blessing and an honor to give and in these days you really be glad you did even if that was in the past you'll be so glad you did that because you were feeding for your future wealth it is one of the signs of the kingdom age being on the earth and how many times did Jesus even acquainted to money or wealth or gems because it was that valuable and he's trying to get that message cause you know is the value what if you find a pearl of great price you sell everything you have that means you up surrender whatever is getting in your way lay down your mindsets your your anger issues your whatever your own what do you think is gonna happen your assumptions lay them down and run after that pearl of great price run into the kingdom go forward ruling reign with Christ in this time and years that God actually created this time there were Scrolls of time opened in heaven in 2012 I've seen many Scrolls in heaven I've seen angels bringing Scrolls when actually brought one to me my husband was with me and dropped it in my spirit that was not strange to me because it's a spiritual thing for a spiritual Kingdom for spiritual time on the earth and what the scroll was talking about was about operating with the hosts of heaven as one of your greatest weapons and it does change your life and the mindset of the traditional legalistic or religious God didn't create religion however God did use that for a time he did when it was all he had on you that he could use he did but he wants a relationship and your relationship with him will determine how far you go to become a priest a Lord or a king those or eternal positions also given and worked out and ruled with in the spirit realm there are spiritual crowns their spiritual Mantle's being given out right now they'll all have to do is ruling and reigning and people say it doesn't say to the Bible oh I don't have time anymore to try to explain to you just go start looking for it he has a kingdom he invited us into his kingdom nothing could stop it from coming nothing can stop the habitation of heaven on this earth and everybody who was a believer from the time jesus said pray this way has been calling it in in the spirit with a frequency in their voice they knew that was a word they knew the Lord had said to say that that was a safe scripture in red and so the ones that are brother they really say a lot well that was Jesus's playing all along he highlighted it he knew they say it regardless of the battles of the denominations or the non denominations or the inter denominations he knew that he could get them to agree on that scripture calling in one of the most important times on the earth called the kingdom age where we will wield crowns and be kings and priests unto our God spiritual kings and priests to a spiritual King and priests so important was it to Christ that he wrote that time on his very being I am the king of kings and the Lord of lords those are spiritual positions of authority extremely important to him because that meant those people understood there was a spirit realm it's where we all came from on the inside of us we are a spirit and have a spiritual body that gives us absolute authority and Dominion through Jesus Christ over any demon any power of Darkness no matter where it is what it is one is doing it we have power over it and those went after it and they made a huge difference their lives begin to change that's cut manifesting for Christ but when people start disappearing and coming back in front of you and angels are with them at their side holding gifts for everybody who is present God loves to give gifts he's your father one of the number one things they do all over heaven is give gifts and they're tangible gifts they're not just something that floats around heaven is a tangible literal world where you have real mansions and beautiful amazing things to have and to give away to people and your loved ones have been getting a gift every birthday you've ever had since you were apart putting it in your mansion until you have your welcome home party one day gives her everywhere because people use their gifts every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights those lights were you before you came here God is he says don't let your hide under a basket but let your shine those are spiritual things all of them accept the gift he's talking about your natural gift that he put in you that you can use right now on this earth because in heaven you will use it all the time your passion your greatest delight your pleasure whether it's a baker or you hold rodeos antique car shows whether you create amusement parks whatever your natural gift is if you're an interior designer a fashion designer a jeweler all these wonderful amazing things that we wouldn't have anything in this room if those people didn't use their gifts athletes have gifts actors and actresses screenwriters script writers special effects people you don't know what special effects are do you see a movie in heaven they don't even have to give them ratings because none of them are rotten because the minute I say that in persons human mind in your national mind ago they would not show movies in heaven why not like they have down here you didn't write those scripts but when you operate with your gift and there's light in your heart then what you produce will be light whatever gift he gave you if there's darkness in you guess what you're gonna produce out of you darkness dark movies dark music dark images on everything out there the marks of the enemy on everything his words being you'd everywhere because those people are filled with darkness but God gave them that gift he made them that gives you corrected me he made them that gift he made them that gift that's why people are drawn to them that in these days they're gonna be drawn to your gift when he said your gifts will make room for you and bring you before great people he's not talking about being an intercessor he's not he's talking about your natural gift if you're an artist if you're an electrical engineer if you know hi-tech and how to put it together create amazing things that gift that you dream about think about probably knew what it was when you were a child and you kind of just let it fade away because you were so busy being what people said you should be every single person has one or you are one that's why he says every good so it said there's not rotten movies in heaven every good and perfect gift no matter what it is you want to do on the earth creep if you could do and make a living that's your gift if you could do it your whole time and make good money doing it because you love it you're blessed by it you're passionate about it a photographer I'm a photographer button I'm always a little I knew I know I'm being a Revelator right now but in heaven guess what I'll be a photographer and I will be excited because it is my passion I collect old SLR cameras you know what that is single lens reflex that means there's nothing what do you call that nothing automatic about it every frame you have to set the frame the light meter you have to focus every single picture you take make sure there's enough light it's in focus everyone and I love it and I'm good at it because it's it's me I am a photographer it's my passion it's my sister's passion my brother's passion we have a bunch of in our family I love photography where would be without it right we wouldn't have any visual anything no matter what form of media you use it in you know when someone has a gift and someone doesn't have a gift I have a guarantee I never had any classes I can stand in front of anything for five hours and take so many different images of that using light the texture the definition the depth of the different lights that are in there the colors are in there or even the materials that is made out of whether it's rough or smoother or soft or you can change it by putting light on it it fascinates me because I'm a photographer so when you feel that way about things that's your gift that's you every good and perfect gift so when we use that gift even is to give it away it blesses God if we use it just to help people maybe it's not what you do for a living but in this time of year things are going to change because living heaven culture get this the difference about being living on earth as they do in heaven they use their gift so if we're gonna live on earth as they do in heaven we will begin to use our gift and actually make money for doing it because God's gonna highlight that gift it'll be amazing he'll make sure it gets out there and it will draw people to you because of the gift can you see that there's some people if you make something so amazing you're really good and amazing they don't care whether you know Jesus Christ or not but they will come and seek you out because of the gift they will make room for you and take you before great people it is so major to know what your gift is even in the spiritual world called heaven they use that gift so we have to have more understanding of what and the word is talking about spiritual things this is one more thing I'm going to talk about I don't even know what time it is in the word this written they were the word that we read all the time hopefully I was fed it like baby food some things he's talking about our spiritual places or physical places some things he's talking about our spiritual things or physical things some our spiritual activities some our physical activities so you need discernment with all you're asking for everything else why not ask let's stand up and do it he said make him do it you're gonna ask for supernatural discernment it will open up the word it will give you greater understanding it's wonderful to sit in here all this but wouldn't it be wonderful if he just gave it to you yourself because we're coming more aware of the spiritual realm and this earth itself would begin to focus on whole lines of apparel the way they build buildings even neighborhoods even schools will be built because of the spirit they follow or worship or practice so we absolutely don't want to be left behind the rest of the world okay we have we should have a greater understanding of spiritual things than this secular world so we're gonna say father I asked for and receive supernatural discernment and sound wisdom that I will bind to my soul in Jesus name I receive it amen amen you can sit down one of the examples I'm gonna kill people keep saying I am so tired don't save tired but they know I keep talking about the knot Flat Earth theory okay but seriously there's a whole group of dedicated committed believers that think they have absolute proof without question that the world this earth is flat because if the enemy can't get you sucked into pure deception like freely sin it's okay Jesus doesn't care or say it's gonna be forgiven and he'll be back up in heaven one day and and that's what some people preach that I I know I know people who were in those churches on purpose for two years to see how far they would go and so people will start just talking about the love love above above God love so much this is okay then you know he loves you and read all the scriptures that talk about love and only love with no accountability they've even made ho Bibles to only left lots of stuff out so there's no accountability now that is deception there's a little bit difference confusion misunderstanding of the spirit realm or no understanding of the spirit realm and spiritual places is really what the whole Flat Earth is based on they don't know but the spirit realm is they don't or they wouldn't be saying that because one of the scriptures they used to prove the earth is flat is the Bible talks about the four corners of the earth north south east and west but they don't think that means that they are literally saying that the earth has corners and another one they use is it talks about the pillars of the earth the earth is set on the pillars of the earth that also is a spiritual thing that's not talking about a physical thing there are two angels over 2,000 miles high that God stood with the earth like pillars until we needed them in the very last days but they're picturing pillars holding up this Flat Earth so it holds it in place and I guess it doesn't fall over or float somebody I don't know about that one and there's a couple more than use but but they're taking them not only out of contacts there's spiritual things that they're trying to say are physical things because lack of knowledge of the spiritual realm so how many people know the earth is not flat see amen please amen I get emails all the time I go no it is not it says God sits upon the circle of the earth so if it's a circle it can't have corners it is a good point it's the word then they don't know what to say well that doesn't look didn't it that doesn't literally mean it's round why don't you go back to geometry class or maybe kindergarden I'm not making fun of them I'm being really serious because if they're there if they are fiercely forcing this upon people to believe this then they should take seriously go back and see what a circle is everybody say it's round so that wipes out one whole Scripture they use and why don't you realize north-south-east-west that goes like this okay nor I'm known doing wrong north-south-east-west something like that those are the four corners of the earth it's actually a direction it's not even something you can see so if the earth was flat you would see had corners and so none of that works out even in your natural mind so I don't know where their mind is but God help them all remove the blinders so you don't waste their time right now if he can't get you into deception he will absolutely get you into diversions and what happens is you're going forward and all of a sudden you get sidetracked you're not on his path anymore that means you're not going forward in the kingdom you're over here like this by the way that's a circle I got to stop doing that people go you're being mean to the Flat Earth people know I'm trying to bring some sense into them or understanding that you're not pursuing the right thing or you'd have the right answers there are spiritual places in the earth all over in the earth and they don't see that they only see this if a God says they see right here it's what they see that's how far they can see if all your head is just man's head knowledge if you don't have sound wisdom or understanding which is knowledge of the Holy One if you're not pursuing the spirit if you don't have Holy Spirit invading you all the time becoming your best friend getting in your face sharing truth in the scriptures showing you things to come revealing the hidden things of God not to flatter I just can't even imagine I tell you what happens not but you know how many people think heaven is a flat place in the sky he's and yet he framed the worlds he framed the worlds okay and they think when it talks about his house it's a building you couldn't contain God in a building first time he visited the earth you set the mountains on fire by walking past them you could hear him walking from miles of and the terror of God fell upon them because they realized he's much bigger and greater than we thought he was he is our Papa he's not well he is our spiritual Papa but literally we came from him first we were in him we lived in him he's passionate he's consumed with passion and love for you so much that it is turned to fire flames of fire with passion that burns for you over the stones of fire that pushes the rainbow out of him if you put a light under gemstones it shoots out a rainbow so the father sits on the throne filled with these massive gorgeously just almost unspeakable with Beauty gemstones that have blue fire flames burning up around him inside of him and it pushes that rainbow outside and it moves in and out of him in waves like that and his eyes are blue flames of fire that your father who spoke everything into being every single thing he wills that with his will how important is your will your reals a spiritual thing you can't reach in and touch your will you can't cut it out and show it to somebody you can't cut your soul out and show it to somebody your soul has a mind it has the will and it has emotions which are all of your actions and your feelings that you display every day of your life those are still spiritual things so you do have a lot of spiritual activity you know that or to think that but it's displayed in the natural realm and seen in the natural realm but that comes from your soul as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that heart that word heart means the core it doesn't mean your human heart beating is that's a physical thing and your soul is not a physical thing it's a spiritual thing it can't ever be separated from your spiritual body you can't separate them okay so your spirit man's affected by what your soul gets fed your soul will affect every part of your being it's at the very core of your being in here very core is your soul and what you let in the eyes are the window to the so what you watch goes into your what goes into your soul you will think about you will keep thinking until you choose it with your will when you choose it with you will you will then act it out so how important is to guard your heart the very core of your being guard it protect your soul protect it from things you see you hear you say you feed your soul all day long that spiritual thing you're feeding it so that means spiritual beings are drawn to what you are displaying from your soul so if you feed your soul darkness what are you going to attract yourself if you feed it full of joy celebration excitement creativity and life and hope and joy what is going to be attracted to it God's angels and God himself so that's why this time is so important why does he give revelation about the soul which is a spiritual thing manifests its sons and daughters of God you have to walk free of the enemy because God's not going to allow you or give you power to do greater works or to shake the earth itself speak to the ground have crops come up purify the air by speaking with his frequency from your voice stopping earthquakes and making them put it back the way it was before he's not gonna let people do that if they're filled with darkness can you see that because you can't take power over the darkness if you are filled with it because if it's in your heart you'll think about it that means yes what you won't your God it will really see her it even talks about it being seared it gets syrupy because you get too much of the darkness in you say Amen this is like this is why it's called boot camp okay I know when my husband see boot camp he didn't know he could do all the stuff he could do so he came out he learned different things he could do how far he can make himself go I'm strong could be the weapons he got and how we could use them he is still a marine trust me and that man looks so good so spirit or spirit realm boot camp God had me started he said you will be taken everywhere this is the second place I have taken it Joan hunter on taxes heard about heavy come at you there they had so many people come in they didn't know what to do with them and I do know that I'm trying to think in the natural now Chuck Pierce sent a whole group of his women down to see what it was all about he couldn't go so he sent a whole coalition down I think like there was a bunch of them to attend and tomorrow when you come I have a handout to give you which I almost never do when you see things that are spiritual in the physical realm you'll see portals opening you'll see things coming out of portals you'll see what some of that spiritual highway looks like and I didn't take them in heaven I took him on the earth but the spirit realm was opened you know God can reveal what he wants to reveal amen he's revealing himself more like he never has before because we're like him we're supposed to be like him right so I never had this understanding about the soul but it made me I understood why things happened after I had the understanding what it was and people trying to tell me oh no the soul is just the mind it's just a mind why do you tell people that other stuff that's just gonna confuse them a point no the so is a spiritual thing and has layers just like your body has layers and your spirit man has layers because God has layers in himself Christ has layers and even Holy Spirit as unlimited layers he takes a layer of himself and sends it somewhere it's a hole of him and that's how he knows everything all at the same time everywhere he sends a layer of himself it's him it's not a copycat it's not just a little shadow it's him that's how he is he sends them wherever he wants to when you invite you into and well you he sends a layer of himself a hole of himself to abide in you that's why you're the temple a shadow wouldn't need a temple but this is a hole be God called Holy Spirit moving into you and you have a hole of him he knows everything about you all the time everywhere you go but he knows everything on the earth no matter where it is what it is what's going on he knows every single bit of it because he has coated this artist with his layers he just grabs one and sends it like that your soul has layers your emotions are the layers the more you have the more expressed expressive the more creative you are and some ethnic groups are more expressive because they have more layers in their soul and between those layers you collect stuff that's where it gets collected remember the eyes are winter to the soul thing that's why you can remember it where does your memory come from it's your mind and you express what you every time you remember something that's not good you're gonna get sad or oppressed or upset and then me want you to think about it over and over and over and over and over - especially if you were offended or somebody says that mugging you he will replay that board all day all night oh you go to sleep at wickham oh you're still hearing it loose it from your soul the word says cast all your care upon Jesus because he cares for you it's just a good way to cast it because you're loosing it out of you and Jesus is also the restorer of your soul you know you don't know how many even I'm saying how many times he talks about the soul it's that important what does that mean what you loose on earth out of your soul he will come down and pull it out because he's a restored your soul if he pulls it out you have no memory of it not addictions not pornography not abuse he is showing us such depth of understanding of how he put us together the spiritual parts he's really highlighting the spiritual parts you know why so the physical parts can be whole because even as your soul prospers you your whole being will prosper and live and that is one of the few promises that promises you divine health is tied to your soul your heart the core of your being that's why we have to have accountability say Amen even in heaven the Angels head accountability and when they didn't line up guess what they went not to a good place the woodshed for sure and it hurt robot so he is he's showing you he's actually dividing asunder it says in the word that - it just sort of divides us under what it's the spirit from the flesh okay so you can live in the flesh and be in the flesh which to be fleshly mind it is who wants to be death if all you think about in your natural head that means your natural head with your own rights your opinions and you're gonna do it your way no matter when you don't care what anybody says it's that you get hurt or they just don't care that your flesh your selfish flesh okay you can't even see your flesh cuz I'm not talking about this flesh I'm talking about in your soul as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so to be spiritually minded is say life that's why you need to know about the spiritual things this is like grade-school understanding the body should have had a long time ago your soul has to be engaged it has been engaged to be powerful through Christ because you let him have his will his way you're surrendering your well to have his ways so if you surrender oil that means you don't have the right to tell it what you do that means your flesh that's in there doesn't have the right to be in control you can surrender you can surrender your life to Christ you could be born again you know you're going to heaven but you can have so much flesh on you it's ridiculous all you think about is you what you want what you want to say you know this is the only thing that's right no it's always been this way we're gonna do this way it doesn't matter what we think God is saying or what you're what you're discussing or anything we think this is it so we're going this way that's not surrender people go I have rights and want didn't you lay them down when you died with Christ because guess what if you're a dead man you don't have any rights if you're a dead man Christ Christ can use you really well but Satan can't use you at all if you're dead you can't get offended if you're dead to the flesh and your selfish flesh if you're dead to those ways those thoughts Satan can't use you he can't win you offend you he can't distract you deceive you that's why it's important to die to your flesh okay not this no greater loveth this than a man lay down his life for another is not talking about taking a bullet it's about you surrendering your rights your opinions instead of pushing yourself on them and telling them they're going to hell God hates them because you think this is the right thing to say no surrender your own words and your thoughts let Christ put his in you and bring them life and then they want him [Applause] this is church this is training you to do the work of the amazing powerful supernatural new creation ministry taking the gospel of the kingdom carrying the glory around this world amen so I think I'm done with session 1 so tomorrow when you come I will have these manuals what do you want to call them programs the Holy Spirit keeps calling a program because heavens having a show right now every show has a program say Amen because that's what we're doing and there'll be some really legalistic people that don't like that because their flesh is still in control if their spirit man was engaged they would think this was very exciting most exciting news I've ever heard we get to put on a show and manifest for God till we shock this world in stunned hell that's the show he wants us to do amen so before I go I'm gonna declare some of you but I'm gonna he told me to share one more thing the first show that was put on was in heaven and the father did that himself he did not need any help from any angel no Archangel not even the word not even Holy Spirit he didn't need their help to kick every single one of those out of heaven because one of his weapons is lightning the lightning power of God destroys and unseats the works of darkness it talks about in the word thunders and lightnings coming from the throne that's coming from him you see these blue lightning bolts shooting across the throne room and people run to get hit by them it's a million megawatts of love and the thunderings many times are actually his own voice because in the word says his voice sounds like many waters or many thunders because his voice has layers when he made the angels see he didn't birth them he didn't send them from himself he just made them he spoke and made them he's he spoke and the word made them the proper way to say is the father spoke he spoke a word and the word made it that's why his name was the word all spirit no flesh until the day he decided to come down here and die for us and he had flesh put on him the second show was by his son when he show him you know it says that God showed his son his reward before he came here he showed him his reward it was more than one okay if you get rewarded for sometimes this more than one thing one of them is when someone comes home to heaven he walks him personally up the steps that throne gives him back to the Father that's one reward I know Heath they told me that some a long time ago that he got to do that so I know no matter which family members living up there now they met Jesus Christ at the gates and you scored him up the steps they had a celebration in the throne room the greatest celebration ever the Father which is out of the glory and held them to himself and this is what they know I came from here and when you meet the one who sent you from himself that carried you for eons of time loved you carried you nurtured you spoke to you saying over you wrote books about you made plans for you he he's your father was willing to send His only Son what a sacrifice that's love that's love and had that flesh put on him and then the greatest there were two things that really that he told me he suffered the most about one was the cup he had to drink a sinless perfect being to drink all the sins of the world in the garden of the cemani that was one of the hardest things yet the other thing was being separated from his father did not hear him for those three days was in hell Abraham's bosom first thing he crossed over to hell by himself that was something they'd never done before because God was about to put the second show on and Christ stood up on the third day according to Colossians and spoiled and ruined and crushed principalities and powers so badly they cannot change their image back after he was done with them that was a second show the third show is gonna be done during the kingdom age by the greater works the signs and wonders the generation that will be on this earth that will live and and experience the powers of the age to come which is the Millennial age it will walk in those same powers it lived to be hundreds of years old like the people who live on the earth one crisis on the throne those people it'll be time for us the vital Christ to put on the third show and torment the demonic blind them with the light of glory that comes from us unseat them crushed what they were doing you know take away all the power overs that they thought they had push back darkness right in the face of the enemy until it torments them and to the light of the glory is seen and known all over this world that is a show so in this time he wants you to stand up and stand out amen okay he made you to be you no man really made you he made you you were always with him until he made this time-space planet and we'll talk about time in spiritual time tomorrow night and then you'll see spiritual activity I have some things in my flash drive but you're actually going to have your own thing you can take with you that'll just get you absolutely undone so this is a great time

we ask that you would be glorified and Lord as we honor cat in Jesus name Amen let's give her a hand as she comes oh very good very good thank you lord thanks um thank you I just got zapped by you that's upside down that won't help me welcome everybody can you hear me okay is this okay I get it a little bit closer is that better okay and I have a gift look at this little mousey he is my laser because before I could you could not really see you I don't know if you can see that you may or may not see it but whatever uh well the good news is everyone should have your your manual who doesn't have one is running he does not have one of these and I don't know if you have anymore but there's a couple people raising their hands raise your hand if you don't have one just like this cuz you probably already looked at it but we're gonna go through it together and I've only done this one other time but the people didn't have it like until like right at the very very end of anything I've never done anything like this before but God's always make me do new things he would not let me create a syllabus and he said do not ever call what you do a conference he said we need encounters in this time so our conferences everyone out there all you pastors leaders start calling it an encounter name it what you want to but call it an encounter we need encounters with a living God we don't need another conference to get head knowledge we need our God to invade us amen he actually called this a program he said you're not gonna do a syllabus which is like this thick we read it go through it scripture by scripture then put it in a closet somewhere I used to do that and so this is actually got pictures because God is all about images manifesting and demonstrating for God is showing his image and his power so in this time on the earth one of the main Commission's I have besides revealing heaven is to reveal the spirit realm so we know what he means when he talks about the spirit and the flesh in the Bible many scriptures talked about that those are usually things concerning your soul the way you react respond or what you're saying of what you're doing is either in the flesh or in the spirit and we all know what the word says to be spiritually minded is life to be fleshly minded is death that means you're not producing anything that anybody needs uses or wants and so more and more he wants us to walk in the spirit learn the ways of the Spirit operate with the Holy Spirit be more spiritually minded than flesh means your human mind your human reactions your human understanding he wants you more and more to understand in the spirit then you can walk in the spirit because then you have life in you and coming from you and so one of the most things lacking in the body of Christ is an understanding of what is the spirit realm because that's where you came from that's what we operate in all your authority your declarations your decrees even your prayers you've been praying aren't about this physical realm you're releasing them into the spiritual realm they go up to heaven which is a spiritual world and they were responded by spiritual beings by the host by Gabriel's angels whatever the respondent in the spiritual manner that impact the physical realm so most people understand while I'm praying this is a spiritual thing I'm doing but most all their other activities they don't think of it as being important to understand the ways of the Spirit and what the spirit run around me so if you were here last night you really if you weren't here last night you really seriously need to get that that tape you need to get it because I talked about how we operate the spirit where in the Bible is talking about things that represents just scriptures they're talking about the spirit realm or spiritual places and spiritual activities that people think that's talking about the physical realm and so there's scriptures in the Bible connected to the spirit and when it's collected to this physical connected to this physical realm and we have to understand if we're going to rightly divide the word then you need to know which ones he's talking about because it changes your life and so that was the first night and I've never actually done that ever before in a meeting I usually would strictly talk about the spirit realm and start talking about what it looked like what went on there some of the beings that were there how we will this world is becoming more and more spiritually minded I'm talking about even the secular world when I say secular I'm talking about the ones that are not believers I know we could call them the lost the unsaved the wicked the the nicest term you can use a secular okay there's the there's the believers about it Christ then all the rest the world is the secular world not connected to God not knowing God and they need to know him everyone came from him that ever came and existed on this earth they all came from him and that's why he said he wants the vilest sinner set free there's only one unpardonable sin that means it can never be pardoned so even the vilest sins you see happening in this world today no matter how horrible they are they can be forgiven if people sincerely ask to be forgiven and repent for them the one thing that can never be forgiven is if you had a relationship with God like Lucifer did Lucifer was not Satan he became Satan he chose to birth iniquity from himself it was found in him certainly wasn't anywhere in heaven nor in God knowing the word nor in Holy Spirit it was birth and and I've talked a whole lot my 80th 81st meeting I think and this climate is very dry I'm I'm from Florida we get a free spa treatment women every time you step outside and you have 100percent humidity so we don't wrinkle easily okay our skin is always soft unless we go up north and then it feels like sand so there is benefits to being in 100 humidity atmosphere people pay a lot of money for that okay we get it for free just living there so I go back home and get my spa treatment but more and more God wants you to know who he is as your true father why he calls you his sons and daughters why he welcomes you home not as someone's husband or wife or mother but he welcomes you home as his sons and daughters because he bursts him births all of us from himself we lived in him I talked a lot about that last night and when I was just in Canada I was in Saskatchewan Canada or it ended up by being seven meetings instead of like four and this place had never heard of me before they sat there stunned and undone and there was one person I'm telling you descent one person in the last meeting I had planned to speak about something that was heaven culture and he said there's one person here I've got to change their mindset about me so you're gonna do something different you never done and I went I showed the whole big picture started with heaven was just heaven and when God began to create things in heaven he created the Angels how we did that all the way to us living in him the whole time he was doing this he's been from the beginning to the end the end at the beginning and the whole time we were in him before he made the earth we lived in him and so we were we were used to going places with him we we could see and understand who he was and then that was taken away from us when he sent us himself he actually made a time space planet so that he could send us to have a body you had a little spiritual body of light you were made out of light and that's in them and by the way the food in heaven is all made out of light you eat all you want to there's no weight gain no food allergies I'm just gonna put that there for free people celebrate they worship they eat they fellowship they worship they eat they eat they fellowship they worship they go on tours of heaven they do all kind of wild fun things and they eat everywhere they go Jesus has a sweet tooth if you got one blame it on him so there's just a few things about about heaven but right now I'm gonna be talking about heaven on this earth and how we are actually being connected to it it is invading at an accelerated rate that means the ways of heaven the things that are in heaven even things they wear certain things they say you're gonna hear new words released I release them all the time about the way they talk in heaven and places they visit those things are being created on the earth and that's not a mistake that's a that's happening now because if heaven this is if it's gonna be on earth as it is in heaven that means we're going to have things similar to what's in heaven created on the earth new inventions and ideas are coming that will actually change your entire life the way we live even the cost of us living is going to change because of these new inventions and then we will be doing some things on earth just like they do in heaven like painting with light painting with light like houses cars a hair will be done with light color not like chemicals and you know put enough foils in your here you could contact Mars every woman knows what I'm talking about if you've ever had your hair done it's going to make it simpler because in heaven they live this amazing life filled with Wonder splendor and the greatest technology ever is in heaven and especially with Holograms they do a lot of things with Holograms only it's not just light it's actual beings and you go to actual places in Holograms with Holograms it's really a way of life it's heaven culture so one of the greatest technologies you see on the earth will be done in computers and other systems and ways and things that we get to enjoy and do will be done through Holograms and you'll see more and more of those invented and put out there it's gonna be amazing why do I want to escape during the greatest times on the earth and that means if this is going to happen things have to improve in almost every arena of our life like wickedness and darkness we push back in regions where they do that on purpose but in many regions of light and glory and safety that will be created on the earth that we will live in and so a whole different change we've already been shifted onto God's timeline and he has his own time he goes by not man's say amen most of you won't even be here during the perilous times or the tribulation that is an extremely short period of time and God still has to have us carry the glory first of all learn how to carry yet what it is how it operates and then the knowledge of it being carried around this world many times over shaking the world and stunning hell that hasn't happened the fire has not happened the baptism and Fire has not happened in mass and it will happen it will come in waves from heaven and the angelic are a part of that baptism and fire I'll show you in the word it says his angels make his ministers flames of just like in the upper room so that hasn't happened in case you're wondering the wealth of the wicked and I was actually gonna have us all stand up and open the vault you're already concerned you already consumed in the atmosphere of heaven in this room and so many prophetic things and words and visions and things will come to you just sitting there just tell open your hand say God I want it I literally was gonna have us date up and open the vaults that have been holding back this is the time for this great well to begin to because people are running after God's time and they realized beginning to realize who they are we shouldn't be held back for any reason because in heaven because there's no sin there's no sin in heaven there's no evil in heaven so when it's not a part of you when Christ's children said there's none of him in me he meant the enemy he meant the devil and he lived as a man in this world with the devil not in him had more fun wreaked havoc to the religious hierarchy of his day and broke all the kind of laws and traditions to show them this is the now time of God right then it was a now time for Christ to be walking on the earth than when he made everything demonstrated manifests the power of God that he actually was over time now under time over the weather not under the weather that he could accelerate propel in time he could hold time still he did all these things walking as a righteous man that's why they causing the son of man he had to be just like us although inside he was still God he couldn't use his God powers he had to actually accumulate and walk in righteousness pursue every level God revealed to him on the earth he had to choose with his will every day of his life to say yes to what the father was asking him to do that's why he that's why he got to the point where it didn't matter where he walked life came and he spoke life wherever he went and that he didn't mind judging the leadership of that day that was lying to the people burdening the people stealing from the people and they didn't like him because he was a great threat to the way they lived their life which was going to change so this is the time of change again change has come to the earth again you're not waiting on it because you're hearing these words live in heaven culture that's on earth as it is in heaven take power over the enemy engage with the hosts of heaven heaven is a weapon bash the enemy you always wanted to hit him anyway right with the only way you're physically literally going to do that is to sip the host of heaven on every demonic being that's anywhere around you and they will crush them bash them literally I I have seen acts of war between the army of light and army of darkness and army of darkness always loses they actually lose parts of their being you can't kill them but they get marred and scarred because there's no life in the darkness they can't get healed and yes the army of heaven sometimes they get kind of beat up they get worn and all their warring but there's always healing refreshing for them they get to go back to heaven and play take a break and then be sent back here to war on your behalf and they're out there for you all the time and when you when you pray or when you command this is the time to come and people go I don't like that did Christ command you better say yes did he command the hosts of heaven did he heal the sick did he not tolerate one demon around him was he ever attacked by demons did he multiply the food so that many was never hungry he wasn't poor he had a treasure to carry his money he paid for the upkeep in the food of all the men that were with him sometimes bought food for everyone who came to hear him which was thousands of people he had homes he had wealthy friends he even had sinners that liked him because he did really good ethical excellent contracts for carpentry you ever wonder what he set with sinners they were business connections he took the gospel through the business world of that day and so did Paul Paul made fabrics work with fabrics made tents made banners he was a businessman even Peter was a fisherman he was a businessman Luke was a physician he was a businessman if you just go on down the line God use business people they already have ethics they understand protocol they understand you know honoring those in authority it was much easier for him to use business people than just people religious that's why you're hearing things about the marketplace the marketplace ministry that's what Jesus did he had a marketplace ministry when he was on the earth a master carpenter who was sought out because of his gift and he was remembered and so was Joseph so get ready to be in business it's going to begin to happen God's gonna give you witty ideas and inventions or connect you to people that you have a part of that business that they need he's gonna bring people together for that and he's even gonna connect and I said this when I was here the last time he's gonna bring Orthodox Jewish businessmen and partner them with believers in business and that is already happening it's already happening you're this is this world is changing and people who want to hide because I think it's the end aren't even gonna be a part of it and guess who he's calling to be a part of it us those who follow him you know it's nice to be a fan of something but why not follow follow means you're running after what he's got and you want to act just like him and people didn't like it when I started saying take authority over the weather teaching them how to deal with the hurricanes and tsunamis the fires and let me tell you what rains went and put out a lot of those fighters when we told it to and that one hurricane got beat up so bad it didn't know what it was doing and I'm from Florida and no matter what they showed you on the news it was not that bad because their own words were saying how horrific is that it would be it would be debt it would be like death to people if you stayed you would die that people were leaving like by the millions I didn't go anywhere because I'm over the weather not under the weather and we even changed the course of that hurricane because it was drought on the on the west side of Florida there was a lot of drought the farmers if there things would have never gone to market if they didn't get the rain they needed on their orchards and their other products of produce they were making and so we actually told it not to go off to the right we sent over to the left of Florida and mainly up the center to the west - and it soaked all of that and they were saying Tampa will be wiped out the city be wiped out and never even touched Tampa and yet the Weather Channel was there trying to say try to show devastation and people saw them mocking it some of the things they show them from past hurricanes I'm just letting you know then they tried to show Jackson was one the worst hit I'm telling you I live there we had some tree limbs come down the three areas that flooded always flood downtown there's an overpass if you drive through a rainstorm you want your cars going to be under water so it always floods see and Marco I worked there you'd walk through water up to your knees just from a rain storm so they had flooding in those areas on Black Creek if you if you want to live there you should have your house on stilts about 10 feet high because that Creek always overflows its banks and the waters receded and people did I'm not saying that wasn't some damage but there was not death and destruction like they forecast and some of those videos that were showing what from past events someone who lives in Kissimmee they saw them mocking what showing people how horrible it was and it wasn't they lived there and they actually I think it was Roy fields was telling people it wasn't as bad as they said some of the lights went out but hey we're used to that when thunderstorm comes and my and my house was not even touched we had a few pine calls hit pine pine cones hit the roof that was it and mainly what happens is when arranged well hard the trees get heavy so they fall on a power line and then it puts everybody's lights out they go remove the tree hook it back up and his fix so it was not anything like they had said it was going to be because the body of Christ for the first time came together as weather warriors and they were we are over the weather because Christ stopped the storm and when he woke up he look at the disciples like what's wrong with you he'd actually taught them that what is wrong with you why did you wake me up he expected them to stop it so this is something we're supposed to walk in it is our right as a believer we are over the weather we are over the earth we are over not under amen and so he's actually starting a move called the weather warriors and there'll be people who are Watchmen that will spot everything going on they will alert all the weather warriors that begin to bash it take authority over it and you're gonna see the weather begin to change around the world because that Devils been driving it and powering it and riding in it to bring death and destruction if we're over all the power of the enemy that doesn't mean leave the storms out or the fires or the droughts you're right and we really haven't just living our life letting it go on we're just giving all that authority than anything mean to run over some beat us up kill steal and destroy and yet Jesus came to bring life and bring it more so start living abundant life so I'm glad he opened the bolts and that seriously happened because that was something God said you was gonna happen tonight so I thought I would be doing that but nope it was pastor so everybody's hold your hands up and say I receive the world bring it on we are over it not controlled by it amen make sure you receive that word amen so so I'm gonna share a show a few things we'll actually share a few things I almost never talk about products I forget I have them and yet when I go and share I'm sharing from these things I already have produced and put out there this is one of my newest ones it's called culture of honor that's how we're supposed to honor each other on the earth how we honor people from the past and then it takes you to heaven how how they honor people in heaven by the way they live their life on the earth how even the hierarchy of heaven the Father Son and Holy Spirit is honored by the angelic and how they honor each other this is heaven culture the honor of culture is one of the main things that you will see when you go to heaven or your chapter you're caught up there amen and so that's it this other one I talked about look at last night born again this is not just telling you receive Christ you get born again you're a new creation get a Bible start reading it and go to church although I I'm saying all those aren't important to be connected to those who believe in operate in the now time of God not that the others aren't important but in that time when God used that he is now using the body of Christ corporately to actually get out there and do the work of the ministry by demonstrating how to live heaven culture on this earth it's not a hard assignment trust me and so this is called born again from the moment you say yes to Christ what happened in the spirit realm what happened inside your entire spiritual being what happened in heaven what happened in eternity what happened in hell this is going to tell you exactly what happened what what you get depart deposited into you by the by the son by the father by the Holy Spirit what happens in the Lamb's Book of Life what does that look like what is your future then look like what not to fall back into you how to order your life now that you are a believer and a follow of Jesus Christ the traps of the enemy operations of the spirit realm I'm telling you this is it right here for people they say give it to them the other student they're not ever gonna fall back into the enemies on they'll never lose their seat that's been established for them I'm not saying that they may not go to heaven I'm just saying they won't be powerful they won't be successful they need to have an understanding from the moment they're safe what happened and this talks to them about the spirit operating in the spirit how their spiritual being how they are a living soul what to do with their soul how to loose things from their soul if they're getting if they encounter things after the born-again it's very it's a little tiny single CD it is a powerful witnessing tool and we actually was recorded this at this church with his pastor lay down his life got got kicked up by the Baptist he's got the Holy Spirit and it's called new new freedom its new freedom fellowship in a little Oklahoma Missouri that has one blinking traffic light and the sign says the little town where big things happen and so we actually recorded and dedicated to his memory he has now in heaven reaping all his rewards but it's powerful is God said I'm gonna finally reveal what happens when you're born again you know what the new creation revealing of the Kings this is the spiritual Kings that he is king over he is a king of spiritual kings those are levels of authority and Dominion that we can go after in this time those are eternal positions not temporal the Bible says we are kings and priests unto our Lord those are spiritual positions for a spiritual Lord who is a spiritual Kingdom is powerful male or female Kings [Music] male or females there are no Queens and people go what about that if the guys the guys if you can be part of the Bride of Christ do you it really what realized as a spiritual position I hope you say yes so in the spirits you can be a Bride of Christ with your male or female say Amen so in the spirit realm you can be a king with your male or female it's levels of authority and Dominion you are taking yourself that take you to those very high levels of authority priests lords and kings are eternal positions and this is a really powerful CD and it talks about and it gives you scriptures of course everything gives you scriptures and then this one is really funny this is called superheroes there I am in a superhero costume yes I've worn one and spoken it before I don't wear the spandex okay you won't be seeing that but I have what I call superhero blue I do have an outfit I wear it and the Holy Spirit makes me wear it especially I do it in healing rooms for some reason that's Ryan de Bie wearing it Santa Maria healing room I think this is where this was taped and it's a double one because they just let me go they didn't care how long I went and I did not know that the pastor who's a great character behind me was showing scenes of The Avengers Superman Batman all of those other superheroes and I actually talked about and this is very fascinating it talks about why the world is wild over them why do they seek after somebody who can help rescue be a role model for people that they bring hope and a future to people's lives why do they run after that how Christ is our own superhero but how we now become heaven superheroes it's very focused it's very good and the first time I ever went back and we and recorded parts of it you couldn't hear clearly we spent a lot of time making this so this is real powerful you are having superheroes and they're all cheering us on amen so that's that's the end of those there you go yes you may give it to him so that was my little commercial amen I've told people it is one of the best witnessing tools you can give anybody give it to him they will want to belong to Jesus Christ it shows him in all his power all his glory the sacrifice he made by changing his image from the word to the Son of God what he literally gave up to do that we know what he did on the earth but you don't know what he gave up in heaven that he had flush put on him for the first time I will always have that flesh through all of eternity because it was to become acquainted with us and and he would be acquainted with our sufferings and our trials and it changed him even when he did that and made him love us more even living amongst us when they were rejecting him he forgave us for that but it really showed who he was as the word where it talks about him being in the word how we work together with the father step in the father he would go somewhere the father would speak what he wanted and the word stepped out and made it and then it takes you to the Scriptures world jesus said you and me and me and you I mean there's so much evidence of the word of Christ what he gave up for us and what he meant when he was saying those things when he was on the earth of course that's talking about something spiritual again when you go home to heaven you step in the Father Holy Spirit steps in Jesus steps in and we are all one together and anyway so but we're gonna talk about spirit realm boot camp right now and at the end if at all possible on living hands on every person in here [Music] and I'm gonna lay hands on you and impart unto you revelation for operating in the spirit realm I've never done it before I've released the life of God I've read I have released the life of God I've released a lightning power of God I've released all kinds of things into people but never this so this is new this is new and this is gonna become like a movement spirit around boot camp and people actually be able to come get trained and go get these managers and go do it yourself okay I can't go everywhere and so at one time I'll actually will have a an event where we what we do training like training with everybody specifically to train you how to share this and you already know it's gonna include living heaven culturing men and how many people have never heard me before can I see your hands a few people Wow well this is a new time on earth and I am living heaven culture right now you're seeing heaven culture on my head heaven is one of the most beautiful places God gave me a commission I didn't ask for the Commission I personally pursued I got born again at 4 out of 65 and I'm getting younger because Christ is the restorer of our youth so if all you're talking about is becoming old you will be you actually have me tell people and your words are powerful your words got you where you are right now where you are right now in your life your words did that even though people may have been involved people came against you they did things to you maybe not even maybe even horrible things but your words what you're saying right now about yourself what you think about yourself what people are saying about you you don't have to accept any of that you accept what God has said about you you're wonderfully and perfectly made you came from him he is your father he made everything that was ever made he has great plans for you he doesn't have bad plans for you he sings over you he wants you to have deep beautif sleep sweet sleep he'll give you sweet dreams if you ask for them whatever you ask for from him he will give it to you so get up and ask for sound wisdom supernatural discernment excitement expectation celebration you know God carries that it's in him all the time or he couldn't create if you were sad even just sadness will stop you from being who God wants you to be if you walk around sad and you don't know why don't keep it in there something happened you 50 years ago stopped letting it make you sad loose it out of your soul because whatever is in there you're gonna think about an enemy we'll make sure he replays every bad thing you did those images are in you you loose them out of your soul it's like they were never there and the next time I go back and speak in a men's prison I'm gonna teach every one of them how to do that I they will loose every crime they ever committed the crime won't be in them when they get out they will never go back to crime prison is a good example of a soul that's all messed up and they don't know what to do with it they don't even realizing that are helping to keep themself in that in that situation in position if you've been in poverty a long time it's probably because you've been saying all along we don't have anything we never will we can't do that we can't buy that we can't have that guess what you're doing you're stealing those works you are you shall eat the fruit of your lips as a man thinketh inside himself so is he and the more you say that you begin to believe it and the more you believe it you live it so let's change the way we've been living our life and start saying things that God says about us I before I knew any of this stuff I get up in the morning I'm gonna start saying what God said about me and every time I said it I said I would feel more powerful in him and he would open up his self and reveal more of him to me because I was actually saying I believed he existed we don't have any problem talking about things all around us going on you see but you know what it's not seeing as believing believing is seeing what you begin to believe you will see in your spirit man and said that's not even in the Bible calling those things that be not as though they were yes it is if you want change start saying what you want changed and then say and I'm willing to be obedient to change anything you want me to change and then he'll begin to give you a list I lived every single bit of this I'm sharing with you I lived every bit of it I I had to go through this I had to actually see that this was truth it was in the word I just believed what it said and one day the more this is if you don't even trust God if you don't trust people because the things that happen to you loose all the junk all the abuse all the negative words hateful defiling words all the profane things that you've heard or said or seen loose it and get out of your soul buying the love of God if you just start without yourself to bind the love of God and the presence of God to your soul and then just start saying God I don't want to live this way anymore I want my family to prosper I want my soul to prosper I'm gonna be just like you you can't remember anything just get before God say I want to be just like you guess what that's what he wants you're actually agreeing with him he sent you here to represent him and to be like him it's in the word let us make man in our image and after our likeness but we walked through this world like well this is my lot no he didn't give you that lot man may have the enemy certainly was a part of that but that's not what God had plan for you those things he wrote in that book about you for he sent you was all the great things he had for you these are my purposes my plans this is what I've sent you to do this is what I've called you to you and yet we listen to a man says all the time or the arts and entertainment media which pretty much 75percent of everything they put up there's bad say man you feel yourself with that you're gonna think about it any man you can have a good time enjoy your life and have fun you just need to be aware of what is not good for you and what it would is very good for you amen and I speak to the Hollywood the movie industry all the time I've already put them on notice they don't stop putting the darkness out there they're gonna bomb and they're gonna lose all their money I've even talked to him about them the habitation of God coming to the earth I don't care what they think they need to know truth too because when they see it happening guess what they're gonna know my gosh is what she's talking about it really is happening people aren't coming to these movies we better tweet them they make a perfectly good movie then they put like 12 profane horrible words in there they have to put one or two scenes that aren't good at all to make them get either pg-13 or R rating even though they can clearly look at the history of Hollywood and see the five top grossing movies of all time RG and PG movies so why don't they want to make them because if they make them that means you can bring your family that means more people but they're because their minds are seared and they live in darkness what they produce is darkness they almost can't help what they're putting out of them because if it's in you that's what you will express how much what you will write and that's what you will you know give out to everyone to see so they need to get saved or at least be aware even though you may think the world lives like this they don't all live like that even the part that's not Christians there's still a good moral majority in this nation that doesn't want all that junk and they've already already five of their top movies they put out have bombed and they've lost millions but the other ones that are just simple people can't stop going to them because they can take their families their friends and if you want to take it up a notch then you can go look at that stuff I don't take you up a notch it takes you down unless you're following Satan then I know where you will end up and you won't like those that you won't like what you get there they're not just no breakfast in hell there's no life in hell there's a song that says that there's a song does anybody remember who wrote this song and my the Newsboys in the father's house or something like that it's called yeah and he actually they say that there's no breakfast in hell and what man they got that right do you know the noise boys I was a Christian group and they were ahead of their time but their songs it was awesome so yes I could go into a lot of different things right now but I want to go ahead and and talk about the spirit realm boot camp and and so if you got you if you got your little thing just hold it up and let's look at it and I will tell you this your natural mind may not understand much of this but your spirit man will really pull it in your spirit man will be so excited that your spirit man is being fed and today they're getting a cafeteria including dessert getting the whole meal including dessert the creature on the front of this is not a cloud this is a spiritual being I didn't cover that part but spiritual beings some of them appear transparent some of them are filled with light and glory this one certainly is filled with light and glory and if you look it's a profile at standing like this and it's got its hand like this can you see that right under its chin it's hand is literally like this and it has one big eye do you see yet in that eye there's only half of a lens because the other part records you can actually see your face in the eye if my mine I can but there's actually a face and this is this this fear this this angels name I actually set a host the hosts are made well the angels are made in drops okay their maintenance ribes the first tribes weren't the American you know Indians they weren't the Jews they were the Angels when God created angels he created tribes of angels and some of those tribes were put under Michael some were put under Gabriel and then the one whole group that was worship angels were put under Lucifer and by the way the only ones he got were the ones that were under him Lucifer did not get one host of heaven from Michael he didn't get one single one of Gabriel's none of them would believe the lies that he was telling they just wouldn't believe them they knew who God was so and he puts marks on angels so marking belongs to God there you go and Leviticus in the original scriptures that weren't have been translated fifty times and people in today's language have made a couple that say don't put tattoos on you and that's not what was said this was about the culture of the day okay it says do not mark yourself with the marks of the dead and I can just tell you what's coming to the body not just hair color in Psalms you should read all of them and there's a scripture in Psalms that says some will worship me and song some and dance and some will put my marks on them in this time I happen to know I've got some of my own children they got has had them creep marks and put them on them that represent him they're young people on fire for him and they don't mind sharing with any single person or individual no matter how wicked how dangerous how you know no matter what they got tattoos piercings everywhere it doesn't matter they will start sharing about the kingdom of heaven and what time it is and that they came from the very heart of God and lived in him and they will listen to them they listen to me because I have pink hair that's not even a threatening color okay little piggies and little babies are pink they're harmless it's also used on Valentine's Day is one of the colors that represents love I didn't pick my air color I didn't even choose to cholera had orders from headquarters because I would be speaking to the world and tweaking the body of Christ this is heaven culture if you made the rainbow why wouldn't they wear in heaven amen so this is a being one of one of the hosts of heaven and which is all tribes of angels these these there's more than one of these angels as a whole tribe named Scout this is a scout I'm gonna you're gonna hear me talk in some military terms because I mostly talk about the army of heaven and it talks about them through all the word even how they physically fought on behalf of Israel I think and if I'm correct Frick was it true that one angel slayed 85 thousand a hundred and eighty five thousand I'm so sorry guy whichever one you are up there one angel slayed a hundred eighty-five thousand astral people wicked army was coming against because people now mostly in this day they attacked the spiritual army of darkness we all know that there is a devil I hope you know there was a real devil some people now are saying there's there were never was a Satan there's people like him that's called deception there is a real devil Christ wasted him on hell and the third day he was kicked out of heaven his name used to be Lucifer it talks about him all over in the Bible I don't know how they get around that they probably leave those scriptures out but there's a real devil he hasn't me all the Angels that were kicked out of heaven with him had become so defiled it changed their features Satan is not creating demons he cannot create life and give life to anything he just can't do it he only can kill steal and destroy so all those Angels he reserved a few so they wouldn't look to file but they are that can appear to people that's why you need to know how to test any angel that shows up to you and says come and go with me you say are you of the Spirit of the Most High God who sent his son to die for the sins of this world and I may tell you if they are not they will either say nothing to you or they will disappear and then you evict him out of your room but whatever you do don't go with them and people are saying yes because they want to have an encounter and it's fine if you want to have an encounter and there are many angels right now who are sent to catch people up to heaven but you need to test them how many people got that say Amen it will happen eventually because more and more are present on the earth more and more people are having true encounters in heaven or true encounters with God's angels and because that happens the devil has to mock something to bring confusion to people he even did that in the past so that's why you need an understanding of the spirit round both sides are out there they're always active a lot more activity out there in the unseen round than the seen round and in this day we need to know and be empowered and empowers you when you know this it's not - but fear in you is to make you fierce against the enemy people it doesn't say that yes it does it says the violent take up by force spiritual violence rising up in you that having causes and encourages for you to come and come against the army use your weapons pull down strongholds / platforms bash those demons get them thrown in or dry place it's called pushing back darkness if we have power over all the part of the enemy no matter where they're operating what they're doing how they're doing it when they're doing it you you as a believer have power full power over them that doesn't mean hide in your closet unless that's your encounter room and he more in this more nor than ever before because of more spiritual things coming to light in the earth and people having encounters you need to know who you're having an encounter with and in when you're when you have that understanding you are empowered that means you have the right to say yes or no to them just because they come up and say come on doesn't mean you have to go okay now if Jesus comes in person and he wants to take you who take you anyway which has happened to me the whole time I'm starting to ask him he'll say why are you asking me you know who I am gonna go kid never mind but even I test him sometimes if I haven't seen him or know of them before a lots of times God will say I'm gonna send an angel this is what his name is this is what he's gonna be bringing you a message for me this is what he'll be talking about I'm like he could just give it to me his health but he's letting me experience encounters and the angelic are here to help us okay the ones that blow unto God care about you very much they've been given assignments to keep you in all your ways defend you protect you even that your foot there will be a time when your foot can't even be dashed against a rock I mean you won't be hurt or harmed this is what Heaven culture is taking you to because it doesn't happen in heaven say on earth as it is in heaven so Thursday from all harm all accusations there's no offense there's no anger no violence of any kind whatsoever no fear whatsoever everyone cares about you they like you they want to know you they invite you over all the time they want to go on tours with you that you you'll know and more and more the deep things of God's this place you can go through the chamber of underst which is where you meet with the father one-on-one in heaven every believer but next to their mansion has a garden with a key that Christ gives you himself and I've seen people where all the time when you go in there he comes to see you no matter how often you go in there Christ will come and see you so yes they want to know you and spend time with you it is a different way of life but we don't have to wait to die and heaven you exist to live down here we've pretty much been existing so if we're living on notice that they do in heaven that means we will exist now to live not be crushed and broken and left abandoned because even if I used to tell people if I lost everybody and everything I ever had and I just stood on a street corner with just me I would have everything because Jesus Christ I live in him he lives in me I know him I know his heart I know his ways I know his plans why would I fear anything because he is on my side this is what he meant when that scripture said why should I fear when God is on my side we need to live like this you celebrate all the time and if things are happening around you you change them you take power over the enemy don't wait for him to show up at your door you start taking it before anything happens those hosts will guard and protect you they'll keep things from you from happening to you they'll go in the traffic they'll move the traffic out of your way they're going the turbulence on the plane and move the turbulence away from you they'll give you favor with every airport person in customs and security at check-in in the restaurant you'll have favor in heaven they live like that so if we're living heaven culture then we get those benefits we don't even have to die in our body to enjoy it but we have been calling it in our father who is in heaven holy is your name now this is the part where you have to really start looking at the scripture in like parts okay we have identified that we're talking about the father say the father Jesus said there's none good but the father and he loves the father he wants us to know the father we came from him we're his offspring so you have just identified who you are saying this to in other words you're not saying these words to Jesus Christ who is our Savior who is our King right we're talking and Jesus said to say this didn't he so if this is something Jesus said to pray he was bushwhacking every Christian to do something that would call in a whole age on this earth people go the kingdom ages and anyone in the Bible quote the scripture with me you've just identified you were talking to the father okay that is his world his home in my father's that is a world called heaven are many mansions in that scripture you're identifying again whose house are we moving to the father's house so you are now talking to the father whom who has his house is the world called heaven and you're giving him an invitation our Father who is in heaven holy be your name your kingdom of heaven come what does that look like your will being done on earth just like it is in heaven that's a whole culture you're not talking about the culture of this world right now you're saying I want a whole new culture I want to live on earth like they live in heaven that is what you said and I'm be the glory you know we we have been talking to him for years and inviting him to come to bring the kingdom age there will be the kingdom operating on this earth in our lives seen in us around us us being blessed by it not being attacked not being sick our souls prospering handling the wealth of the wicked being above in every area of society of government of Education in the news media in arts and entertainment all of it to medical arena all of it because in heaven everyone excels their gifts are operating at the greatest level they create they invent and they celebrate all the time wouldn't you like to live that way on earth as it is in heaven so people say well you can't do that you just looking to go on earth as it is in heaven so we have entered into that time resurrection morning 2012 we stepped off a threshold of time and stepped in a whole new age on the earth God measures time by events so when an event that's been going on is full a fullness of time comes sometimes it takes into a new season of our life or something new God's doing but when it's time for a whole new age to come on the earth that is huge because when a new age comes to life drastically changes and many new things come and a new season you experience new things you see God doing new things but in a whole new age they got it designed for us to opera in to be known in this time as manifested sons and daughters that means it's going to drastically change so that's the time you're in we're not waiting on it it's here you have to say yes so this back to this being in I don't know if you you you can't see the picture between screen anyway I already told you that you can clearly see that I anyway it records the activities of Hell and then you know God doesn't have to do any of this but he loves to be involved in our lives he loves to engage the angels and to doing things for him because they have something to do and that's gonna make something that will happen to us or infect us in some way so this is one of heavens of one of the tribes called Scouts this angels name is scout the Holy Spirit told me and you can see the glory all over it I mean it's just good like the glory running up and down if I can get it on the screen oh are you I used to battery dying anyway Wow all the way up here you can see the light all over in this being and and he hides well in the clouds and then me look at that and they go well that's nothing because the enemy's brain is not as intelligent as the hosts of heaven because when they fell they lost some of their intelligence they don't know everything all at the same time they don't even know really God's plans for us but when the time comes for us to start manifesting they know there's a new time and therefore they increase their activity but it's not gonna do any good because of who you are what God is doing with us right now so listen listen if you can come to if you can look at the next one I don't know if we can actually see that and I don't know if it if you found did you find the unseen realm say yes if you can find where I have the portals and there see I have files I have probably over a hundred pictures of angelic and you can tell that it's a creature and I continue the thing about Gabriel's angels he's over most all of them look like us they look like a human most of the army don't look anything like us they have some kind of a body they have arms and legs sometimes some are just huge massive eyes with like facets in them and they have wings on those eyes that go around and record my eyes go to and fro on the earth isn't just God looking it's eyes that are part of the host that he's sending to record things yeah this is this is a real portal that this one is I'm Tara member where this one is this is Kansas you can see some of the faces they look kind of scary kind of if I had to call it scary right across from this marker do you see that head it's huge it's like it's huge it's right to the left of this on the corner you see it looks very fierce right how many people can see it say Amen okay that is one of the hosts of heaven you can see the eyes right eye sockets right below that you see his mouth kind of open mm-hmm yeah yeah it's right like the portal open portal looks like a heart see that yeah and you see eyes looking down from inside at the very bottom kind of to the left you see two eyes those creatures haven't come this is a portal an open portal to heaven and normally it looks like it has part of the rainbow around them this is not the Sun this is an open portal a true portal into heaven and these creatures are coming out to fight to go to war and there's one on the two i'ma say on this side also to the far right you'll see a face right here it looks like a lion kind of like a lion face well that there's one that looks like the moon you'd be surprised how many of the hosts actually have a head like the moon like a crescent and so these creatures I know it's makes a little bit harder that I can't show you I'm talking about at the top where the arch of the hearts are there are lion faces they have like pink outline to them they're not really big at the top of that but I just mainly wanted you to notice the portal we're gonna look at a couple portals that thing has passed through these are creatures of heavens army coming in to go to war and so that's called an open heaven and when Christ come into the heavens to open an open portal happened and I'm just letting you know he did that as a righteous man he said many times I come in the heavens to open because he was say commanding everybody say Christ was commanding say God said Khomeini me that didn't mean he was telling you to tell him what to do that meant you were saying what was gonna happen if we're ruling remember if we're ruling we command that's declaring and decree what you declare and decree that's not you saying God I want you to do this when you're declaring decrees going to happen I will be free I will walk in the light of God I will be a carrier of his wealth I will carry the glory I will do what Christ did and greater works you're declaring something that's not asking say not asking commanding it's important if you rule your kings and priests into your God we have the right to command because Christ did and what he commanded was always what God wanted because you know him so these portals open whenever God sometimes just does it sometimes when things new anointings new Mantle's right now these portals are opening releasing wealth because we declared it it's already happening so let's go to another one if you have another one who this I showed it a long time ago I used to have these prints with me and this is a being looking down like this and that light is the top part of his head you see a mustache and a beard and dark like dark hair all above him like up there at the top his forehead there's one eye there's his nose can you see it say Amen how many people can't ask me your eyes to be open do that portal you just saw never might judge you there were lines at the top of it looking in well well let me see these little small things you see right above here all those are Lions that came in there is a whole tribe there's a huge Lions head right to the left of this thing there's two eyes here his muzzle right here right underneath here this is the hair see the see right under here see the dark hair you see the dark clouds below this from here to here there's dark clouds that is this beings hair you're looking at who's looking down like this so you're looking at the top of his head can you see it now then you see a rainbow around his face like right here around his face you see that rainbow that's where the portal was and then right at the butt of that one part you see his nose a mustache and a beard he looks sort of like Jesus if you had that up right it would look like Jesus it's it's not Jesus though he is a guardian he's a guardian over the state of Florida and that wasn't Kansas that portal was the one in here is Kansas this one but if you look at your paper does that look like a heart do you see the rainbow kind of around it yeah see that's a different that's that's a real portal in Kansas but it looked very similar to the one you saw up there that look like a heart with the colored light around it and so right below where his head is if you look right below you see the face of that line that's looking full out so the so up here underneath here this from here to here is that being the top of his head's up here that's where his hair is right below us here is his forehead with the colored light running around his whole face like that that's his I blow here in the middle of that light is his eye and then below that is his nose and it's all looking down so that is uh this is the guardian angel every state has a guardian angel and below that his head is this huge line that came in with him and down down underneath here right above are all those small faces if you could blow that up those are all small lines and some of those were the ones looking in at the top of the portal so let's go to the next one and all these things came that you're gonna see it came through the portal and the next picture is probably here you go that being you just saw looking down picked his head up turned it and blew the breath of God out of his mouth and the very center of the picture well right underneath this thing is the Lions Eye you see the pupil see the round pupil okay so this is something if I think there's what the lines I underneath here underneath here is the other Lions Eye then you see his muzzle at the end of his muzzle is that angels head you see the whole head you see the forehead the eye sockets the nose you see that light that bright light in the middle is the breath of God he's got his mouth open you can see his chin under that how many people see that let me see your hands this is a real encounter and all the women on my staff we were all going to a women's conference at one of our friends places in Fort Lauderdale and about part of the way down this whole encounter happened and and we got these pictures so yeah so that's the same being you saw with the dark hair you even see the place right underneath here you see like it's kind of punched in cuz he picked his head up and turned it and he's blowing the breath of God out of his mouth and there's other beings and there's so many I'm not gonna compliment so this is this came from that one open heaven at four o'clock in the afternoon in Florida is not dark and so and the Sun wasn't even on that side it was over on the east this is looking towards the west close to floor so let's go do another one this is not the same being but this is a being that came through at the same time and if I outlined it from here is his head with a count he's looking forward like this his face is like a crescent this bright light you see like let me get this right underneath here is his eye and then you see his cheekbone which has got a lot of bright light on it okay can you see it so you're looking at a profile again you see his head looks like a crown on it like this his eye which is really big and his nose is sticking out from there and then his chin with his beard you can see him in his chest underneath his head or eyes like up above this part you see almost like eyes in the middle of his chest up about this part this this angels name is Zoey he has eyes in his chest like here are you giving me a pointer oh I don't mind doing it well you already know where it is okay you need a step stool okay okay where is where's this beard did you know that's not his beard you can't reach it alright why don't you point to his chest that has all the eyes in it let me have the pointer just no no no no no no no no show you this part I'll be out be back on the camera in a minute okay this part right here our eyes in this chest you can see the eyes you can see blue eyes all this is like this zigzag her eyes in his body okay over here actually is the head of a big lion his eyes his nose this is a huge lion that's with his creature okay in this creature I'll be careful at the cords okay this arched part right up here is his head the crown of his head he has a crown on that is his cheekbone that's all bright white see it there's his eye this is his cheekbone that's his chin with his beer right there and what he's going into looks like a bunch of peacock feathers you see the colors that is called the dark glory it talks about God hiding himself in dark clouds of glory all of this part looks like all on the left edge he's going into that glory it's coming down over his face that's white part of us over his nose and and on his face this creatures going back up into heaven through the dark glory and they groomed the living creatures there's you some new news that's actually what there's a whole tribe and I knew this but I didn't know an ancient Hebrew writings it actually talks about the Zoe that groomed the living creatures who don't know who the living creatures are read revelation 4 well it talks about the living creatures the four creatures around the throne of God that cry out they have eyes in their bodies and in their wings this creature was created to groom them and I thought what I used to see when I looked at it was I thought it was the head of an eagle it looks sort of like an eagle and God had me going to zoom in I literally standing here can see those blue eyes in his chest and so that's what he does that I can see the big lion head and this is what this appeared in the physical realm so we were seeing the the spirit realm exposed in the physical realm and you see all that green and blue to the left that's the dark clouds that God hides in the south man let's see if there's there may not be one more in that series are you looking at the host or the unseen the host okay I don't know if there would be another one in there or not is that the last one he's outlined I did it because so many people kept saying I can't see him can you see him now everybody should say yes that is what you're looking at and I outlined it because people kept saying I can't see it so this plate it's a plate that you see that has like the zig zags on the end all those are living eyes in his body and that's his face right there there's his beard he had this covering on his head but he had a crown on him and and so he's going back up into the dark glory and if you go back to the other one now you'll actually be able to see him you see him now that's why I outlined on your page whatever page that's on you see at the bottom that is a different one but still the same thing I could see them clearly but it was so amazed me yeah it helps to have them outline because then when you look in the sky you're gonna go WOW okay it doesn't have to look like a human face with human clothes wearing them when you look up in the sky sometimes you'll just see layers of eyes rows of eyes because the army when it comes to fight they can layer spiritual beings like 50 could stand where I'm standing because they're layered beings they're spiritual beings so anyway I didn't even know about that for several months and the hoster said you go back and look at that you're not seeing it yourself so I actually zoomed in on it and I went I got someone done I'm like this is amazing and the reason why I know their names and what they do is because the Holy Spirit told me so I don't know if so you didn't find the one that said the unseen realm okay there you go now he's on your paper can you see him better this is not a cloud people call them clouds this is a real literal spiritual being they look kind of transparent looking they don't have like a body like ours like this if you ever hugged an angel it would feel like hugging straw if you ever hug one and it really when you hug them even when people go to heaven if they hug them it feels like it's it feels like they kind of give even the powerful ones it feels like they're not made out of straw they have real bodies they use their arms and legs and that this one looks like a lion and his name is Rex he's part of the Royal Guard a tribe of angels that all look like lions and they're sent to guard the Kings the priests and the lords and people have said I see lines in the sky everywhere because in there and there and then their wings come from their neck you see his wings when he goes up that when one goes the other way he also has eyes in his bodies got one by his mouth there's an eye he actually has two eyes here right here he's got a flat nose like a lion and underneath his long moustache she's got long mustache and his hand is further down he's holding a scroll in his hand like that it's a living scroll to life and it's name is justice because justice is coming to divide of Christ he was assigned to earth during this kingdom time and he actually is the head of the army I command he also had orders in that scroll for me to command that scroll was sent by the father and from that time on when I got back home he said you have to invite the Royal Guard to come and be your weapon to put on strongholds for you I I didn't I didn't just hear these words he actually showed me the being that would be the head of the army so I started with a hundred I have a billion you know why I send them places they don't want to be bored okay if you come in an army you better be sending them all the time and you better give them commands if you wake up in the middle of night go outside and give them one like today from my hotel room they were waiting when I open those curtains I knew they'd be waiting and I had told them that I was going to send them into Denver to put on every stronghold of Pharmacia of marijuana the misuse of it and they were gathered so I couldn't even see the end of them they were always just waiting and so when I just said I take power over all the part of the enemy working with and empowering the use of marijuana the lies of marijuana the destruction it brings it takes you out of your natural mind it is not good for you no matter what they say I lived in the 60s I saw what it did it actually did ruin people's lives it caused so many accidents from people doing that and then driving and it doesn't do good no matter what they say it's just not good it talks about not using that in the Bible it talks about our not having anything to do with the necromancerr which is witchcraft is in the Bible and so I sent them to pull down and be strong expose every illegal especially the illegal use and I even told them you go expose every person group or place that is illegally used that stuff and then it said they make it clearly known expose what it really represents take the blinders off the eyes of the people I sent them to Denver from here and because they're really making it look like it's a good thing it's not a good thing and the police won't tell you they don't know how to handle it but they don't even know what to do with it because their shops everywhere and when they say fresh green they're not talking about salad and they're every they're everywhere cuz I just went through there and so I told them I and I'll and I mean one second later looked in the sky was just nothing because they had left they left instantly want to sent them so I expect things that start happening and I don't know if you have got is there another one after that that's a close-up so you can see his face can you see his mustache oh they'll go see out again you can see almost like fur or hair on him and you actually can clearly see the two eyes he's got two eyes he actually has eyes along the side of his face right here like those little groups of things their eyes I know we think they have to be uniform like we're going to have eyes on a creature no there could be like a whole mass here and then some here and they can see no matter where they turn their head they can see that that what the enemy is doing around them and you see that deep okay you see the deep dark blue in front of that angel and then what Rex is the one that looks like a lion if you go back there real quick you'll see a rift you see a rift that is not the natural world you're looking at through that rift that is what he came in out of and so usually if there's a it's still a portal it's just a different kind of a portal and he came in from there and then although all the rest of the sky was like a light blue if you can go back to the other one you'll see light blue around there's some kind of a light-blue off to the far left corner that was the natural sky but that deep blue around him is him coming in I actually have pictures of him my husband was with me goes something was coming in over there he's Scottish she's got five layers in his soul so he doesn't get excited about anything but fishing and he goes oh something's coming in over five storeys of condos this creature was bigger than those five storeys of condos and he came in flat and you could see him flat when they come in from the spirit realm the physical realm they're flat cuz they're spiritual beings and then when they fully manifest you see their whole appearance and then and I took a bunch of pictures of them and I was really glad I took those pictures and and and so that Scout you can always see the glory somewhere on them you can see the light of God on them and so I think that's enough I'm going to talk about one of the ones I don't know if they have oh wait there's Piper see him on your paper he sort of looks like a human I'll be taking too long doing this I hope not you know how many people don't know this stuff they don't understand their spiritual beings out there warring on their behalf he's gonna get the stick gotta go get the pointer oh that's his nose you plainly see that pointed nose right and then then his eyes see the pupil in his eye see the pupil oh yeah yeah right there's his eye there you go and the outline and again for some reason I get a lot of profiles of these creatures and you see those pieces of you see the streams coming up to him all these streaks of the of the light he actually and I'm gonna bring it back next time I come he came off of a transport from heaven that almost looks sort of like a thin top and began to spin and it spun him off in layers I have layers of him it's wild because God creates and liners remember so this is the stream which is left but that's him I have different layers of him coming on these streams I could actually picture the things spinning and these light waves started coming off and it was it was he was coming he was transported and deposited this was across the street of my home because remember the army I had asked to come they came and this is Piper and he's got a like a Scottish ham on his head see the plume it may not show you in here but because this is a spiritual being on the top of that plume our heads nothing weird say we serve a mysterious God say there are strange creatures in heaven but to heaven they are normal we are strange and he came oh I hope I know at one time I outlined the other one but he comes because the army came and he's the inspector of the troops he was there to inspect all the troops that were assigned to me and he pipes with a pipe like a little flute and his name is Piper and he inspects those troops and he looks huh he SC that points right there so anyway he's fierce isn't he he looks tough yeah and he makes those troops believe he's tough because if you had a sergeant that trained you in boot camp I promise you they didn't look happy or nice or even treat you nice because they were to whip you in shape my husband all the time talks about Camp Lejeune where he was trained in the Marine Corps if you swatted a mosquito you dog a six foot by six foot grave and put that mesquita in there and covered it up chat you're right and if one other troop laughed they dug a six foot by six foot trench and found something kill the mesquita and put it in there because they were telling you better not show one bit of emotions about what's going on or you will have the same punishment so those guys who train the troops or inspect the troops they have to be fierce they have to be focused and it's no different in Heaven's army we have armies because they have armies they have positions I trust you they have people that inspect the troops they have troop transports that bring the troops they have captains they have generals they have all kinds of Admirals in the Navy they have lieutenants they have positions of authority in the army and so does heavens army so you're getting a seat part of heavens army so wait if there's another one let's see it this one's a little bit harder to see but up in this left-hand corner if you look really good you can see a creature riding on the head of an Aragon in the middle of the picture you see a face this got spikes on his head spikes going right there see them and this head is sort of shaped like that he's got Troy he's got like diamond-shaped eyes move it over a teeth there's one what there's one and right across is the other eye it's got again white white white he's got like a mustache that's his head and this creature over in the left hand corner that looks like he's got a crown on his head and his eyes are right below it I / I you see the shoulder of his arm right over to the right of his face there's this whole shoulder like this like bent there's a shoulder on the other side and he's riding he's got like a kind of a leather skirt on right below his torso and his leg is on that part of the creature comes down and he's riding on that thing into battle can you see so that's an Aragon a different kind of Aragon there's actually another creature with him you can kind of see the face kind of next to the head of the Aragon and this was taken was at the beach just walking and talking and he was there writing in the sky under underneath for hours he was old above where I was at so they heavens real and they have real real real hosts this is trooper and coming he's he comes down you can see his head he's got a big eye up at the top of this white being that's his eye he's got a mouth almost like a beak coming out right here underneath his eyes right underneath his eye comes out of him right there and then the back around his head if you go up the other way that's the top of that going down there keep going right there's the top of his shoulder again you can see the shoulder and his arm his hand is made like this his hand is like this right down here by his side see the hand yeah see the opening in him it looks like stairs that dark partner meets his neck this an opening and out of him is coming heads can you see the heads coming out to the right of him come down right there go across to the right to the right right there's one and right next to them is another one like it at the bottom that's an angel go down down down I'll go to the right that white light that is an angel you see the streak coming he's coming out and there's heads although down his back go back to the top of his head and then go slowly down his back and you'll see faces keep going keep going keep going right there are some faces keep going there's a whole head keep going keep going right down towards the bottom a little bit more to the left teeny bit left see the eyes eye across and that is a nine that's a head so these are beings that have already come out of here this might be too deep for you but you better get ready for the deep because we are going into deep places this is this is not I did not Photoshop this I don't even know how to do Photoshop I'm too busy traveling and speaking and main character heaven but this is something again now this was in Kansas this was in Kansas and the creatures you see at the bottom that I've outlined on this page right below Piper those troops that's the whole line of troops hundreds of them made exactly the same in there and this is trooper that they came out of now the person driving me was a prophet and we were there in the middle of America to declare stuff and to declare different things and every resurrection morning I'm there declaring with my staff usually 8 a.m. when it's like really cold it takes me out of my comfort zone because I'm usually sleeping but so this creature comes down and he opens up and then the army comes out and his name is trooper because he transports the troops some of you thought this is way beyond wild but I thought this is what should be happening in church you should have revelation about the spirit round you should know what spiritual creatures are you should know what the army of heaven looks like and what their operations are that's where we came from you came from the world where they live it was never normal praise God so we're entering into times that aren't gonna be normal but when you begin to live in heaven culture it'll seem normal to you and you will begin to have encounters you begin to hear God speak revelation to you and so you need to understand he does operate in mysterious ways which means strange to us what God usually does isn't the way man does that that's what we can't get in our mind if it doesn't line up with our mindset we don't want it but God almost always does something that doesn't line up or even make sense to our head in the Bible he almost never did anything that made sense why rescue a whole group of people then send them into the ocean to be consumed and then have the army chase them dinner to the end and see what to die no he was gonna do something more he was gonna demonstrate and manifest his power on their behalf so to us it was a that's insanity to rescue a whole you know a whole group isn't a group of people then send them apparently into destruction and Moses had to be willing to stand at the edge of that water and hear God step into it and the entire water obeyed the command and parted and they walked not on damp ground not muddy ground but they walked on dry ground and in these walls of water were all the cysts sea creatures and all those things swimming in the wall of water that was held back by the angelic so there's one thing right there that man would have never done right so is there anything else because I'm gonna try to finish this one you can clearly see because I sketched dead now this angel is a regional angel he's overall the guardian angels of the western states yes and I actually know his name his name is jolt and he wars with lightning a lightning staff that's lightning coming off of him is coming off of all over him the glorious he again has what you would think and I saw him I was taken to the middle of the the desert in Arizona outside of Phoenix literally in the desert was carried I was about to go do a six state thirty-six meetings in six weeks in the West and God said I'm gonna let you see somebody who has authority some of the hosts of heaven where the host of them actually is ruling in that area pushing back the darkness and he is fights with the light my lightning power and he said he's right there now so I instantly just there and I was standing down from him he was huge I mean the mountains were behind him there's the mountains behind him he was huge and he had this lightening staff and it was alive and those feathers at the bottom of his out garment you see all have living eyes in them and and you see the symbol that symbol you see it in a lot of the North North American Indians you see that symbol on their tents on their blankets that came from heaven okay and inside that symbol are living eyes everything on him was alive his eyes were like triangular shaped even the pupils were triangular shaped like a lightning bolt and and off even that the tips of his wings you see lightning coming off of them and he had been fighting the demonic in the desert because God was about to do something new in Phoenix and and if you don't know for sure King's ministry is there and so I was going to go speak actually at her place I was going to speak I was being interviewed by her and that many of the tapings you'll see on my website calm you'll see them I also have revealing heaven calm and he said I want you to know who's fighting and when I got there they all got undone because I actually I'd sketched it took it to my artist at 11 o'clock at night and I said you need to refine this because I have to take it and I want to show - Patricia Camus people and they said that they had been having reports the authorities have been having reports of lights in the desert like lightning bolts but there were no storms and they didn't know what it was and so I said well I said this is what it is and so he was using the lightning Paragon to destroy the things of darkness that were trying to start over there and he probably was protecting her in her ministry because she was stepping into the supernatural at that time and and so he was sense her to protect and his name is jolt and we're gonna make a t-shirt that says meet jolt one of the hosts of heaven and none in the back will say who's got your back who's got your back okay cuz we got Heaven's army that's he's got our back and if there is it one more are y'all enjoying these God is wild these are the days of the wild things these are if you look if you look in the very center of the picture you'll see a skull just ahead I'm gonna show you with a stick I mean the very center it is a skull right there you see the whole head it's like right up there go go up further up further to the middle of the picture in the dark part right there go around way up there's eyes all the way around like a head down here's his chin and you see demons coming out of his eye sockets this is this is a demonic all of these are part of the army of darkness if you look over here there is a lion there's his mane and in his mouth he has a part of this being and these demons are running as fast as they can this is the lion's leg this is his body this is all his Mane right here there's his eye it's dark blue see it so this is one of the hosts they really look like a lion someone would look like literal lines he is attacking this demon right here in the sky and out of his the skull of this demon are coming many tiny mini demons this whole thing right here is a demonic this is the body of the skull this whole thing from here to here and there's the lion's mouth and you see that dark thing in his mouth that's its tail so he's attacking this is just a random picture I got the sky when it was out speaking somewhere so that's pretty awesome now I know this looks kind of scary but it's not this creature and again sometimes I need to outline this is his mouth roaring there's his eyes eye this is his head he has a staff what is some of the demonic that he has captured there's heads 1 2 all those were heads and he has been warring this is over my house again they were bringing their what they had caught they had caught the enemies they caught the army of the enemy the dark and have them there's another creature right now in here see and there's his head looks almost like a snail there's his body there's his neck he's a good guy and this guy has got a lightning staff and he's got all of the enemy that he captured taking him back up to half taking them to whatever they take them probably a dry place I didn't know that was on there that's that was pretty weird say the army is fierce because they're fierce against the darkness they are not pretty boys with harps oh this is a good one you're gonna see you actually gonna see a nut you're gonna see a witchcraft spirit in a minute I was in Mississippi we had a something happened in our meeting and a woman was there filled with witchcraft spirit and she was screaming when I started talking about the face of God I mean everything was fine I started talking about the face of God was like stamp of stone and this woman stands and screams like non-stop and I was ignoring it because the Holy Spirit said ignore it he didn't say the woman ignore it and so people are standing up rebuking it how are you and Jesus because they have a lot of witchcraft in Mississippi and those people know how to deal with it they're intercessors are powerful and and I mean it's not like just a little spirit of witchcraft I mean they have omens hung on people's property and lift lift on their doors and things written on the door of their houses with symbols and and they have driven a lot of them out of a good part of that because I came and taught him how to do it I showed them greater warfare but but this and I can't use that Jesus dick so we told it and after this meeting my staff got together one I'm not happy just telling you to leave that person and finally when the meeting was over she started heading down and I have a black pastor friend who lives in Memphis and we were in Oklahoma Mississippi when this happened and let me tell you when those women take their earrings off and their gold heels off you better get out of the way and my sister Jen was sitting next to her she goes if she comes anywhere near cat I am taking her down Laurie lavender and their precious people if you live in Memphis go to their church it's powerful they live heaven culture they live by revelation and they're powerful people but they came to hear me and so she did she wouldn't put him back on so when the meetings over here comes this woman down right and I'm walking over there and Laurie gets right next to me and I'm okay it's gonna be okay and so he didn't want me to make a scene because that spirit wanted a scene he said you're gonna hug her and release the anointing all you can and release end her and you say in her ear get out and when I did that you could see her whole face is like Jesus went it the spirit left and she was crying and weeping and then the pastor that the born-again CD was made in his church that was his church where that happened so he came down and minister to her loved on her and so we went back to our room our little quarters and I said I'm not happy telling you to leave them though lady we're telling her to get out of town and just four members of my staff we held hands always said okay you spirit of witchcraft get out of town in Jesus name and that was it so the next day we went into Memphis to look at some stuff and on the way back you remember we said to get out of town we're coming back into town from like this direction I'm a hand person we were down that way into Memphis and we were coming back into Okolona and and margaret was driving at me I don't ever drive because recently I did that in Mississippi it took me five hours to drive a two-hour drive of five hours I get off the expressway and got back on off the expressway and back on and Jen's going no don't go there but the exit was way over here and I didn't see it so I had kept going I had to try to go back that was back that way and that's what it's like to ride with me so I don't drive anymore I just heard from Elijah's people are his cat couldn't come by herself is she gonna run a car from the airport and drive to wherever that place is in Oregon and and I said I know that my person didn't get to answer I want just so you know down this I never drive I never come alone I would never make it there but I'll make sure my staff never contact you there's reasons so anyway we're coming back in from this part of town and this thing right here you're looking at is a whole head you see a tongue sticking out see that that right there I'm pointing at not that up over here where I'm pointing up here over over over to the left to the left keep going all the way to the left you see something that looks like a big chin and there's a slit I the mouth is open can you see it can y'all see it like you're stepping on stuff this is it right there there's a whole head right there its tongue nope over here it's right here see them the pointer nope over it's over that way right there I should people are laughing everywhere in the world entertainment like this y'all gonna give me a it's there you go that's his chin that's the tongue go to the left that's his tongue it smells is open go back out of the mouth up here going around the top of the head keep going you see the little lump right there keep going and there's the eye it's just a little slit I'm making a mess with this microphone he come back down where the tongue was yay keep going to the left go to the left up nope nope back that no Yelp you were past it you see when you went around the forehead go back to the forehead yeah go down down a little bit there's the eye nope there you go yay are y'all entertained oh well you will see the other thing without me pointing in anything don't show them yet don't show them yet so when I was driving do you think it's safe whoops - let me step on that huh good thing the angels are on me they're all going like this we will not let her fall so we will come in in and I went Margaret there's something in the sky so she slows down she's driving and it's just the long road she slows right and I'm like click click click click click and the Holy Spirit said to tone on it and he said that is that witchcraft spirit you told it had to leave town remember we're coming back into town it's leaving he said it doesn't want you to know it because it's embarrassed so I'm gonna remove what it's hiding behind it'll let you see the full face of that witchcraft spirit show it to them Dennis if you see it say Amen [Music] [Applause] see the tongue that was sticking out see the bump on the back of its head still there there's its long chin there's this tongue there's this nose there's this eye the little white spot and then go up around the top of the head and you remember that thing had had was a lump on it there is on the back of its head right there and that witchcraft sphere is screaming because it was exposed and I knew that it was leaving town because we took authority in Jesus name and told it it had to leave isn't that amazing yeah it was a bad day for them so there you see some of the darkness these are these are Gabriel's these are some a gay girls group they collect the worship and every time you worship today every time here there's so many angels with these beautiful vials about this high and they're lavender and they come up and they go like this and they come by and they keep all your worship they click the worship from everybody every person their worship goes in there they're actually not holding swords they're holding these vials but they're filled with the the worship it turns into golden incense it talks about your worship being like an incense before the throne of God and so these this is a stairway into heaven I literally saw the stairway this was on the National Day of Prayer in my city and God told me take my sketchbook and I was sketching the scene and cinnamon came up behind me went what is that and I want those are angels who said I can see they're angels but what is that right there that's a stairway to heaven I said when those vials are full door carrying up and pour him before the throne of God and it releases an aroma in an incense from our worship and I found out it was it was a rabbi he was dressed like he was Jewish but I didn't I didn't know what his title was so I wasn't going on he gave me his card and said when that gets done I want that to put in my office and he said I'm from such a such a temple if you ever get time I would like for you to come and speak and so there it is it's finished and and so that was from the National Day of Prayer man there were thousands and thousands are our city has a thousand churches in that and for probably now twelve years the pastor's of every denomination even Orthodox Jews and if they all come together the Messianic and Orthodox he we even have Catholic priests come and at noon every Tuesday at a business wwg a mechanical contractors who's he's a strong believer he holds this breakfast in his employees lunchroom it's about 300 people they all come and they all agreed to lay down their differences and they all hold hands and pray for a move of God to come to our city to bring the church together to work together on behalf of heaven and so so every time we have a National Day of Prayer is powerful and what you see down in the middle you see like columns and the middle one has like a red cloth like an X on it if you'll notice how they're dressed the Angels have their gowns and they are wearing a red sashes crossed like that and I know the persons they they heard that had this vision from God to create that you see the columns behind them they were actually saying that this is heaven this is what I having spot is going to be and they designed it exactly like what's behind them even to the point of putting the red sash on there I showed them this painting and so mmm heaven comes your your your worship is inhabited by God it is precious it is powerful when these angels travel back up to heaven they break holes in the second heaven and bash Satan's a Little Kingdom he set up there and break holes in it and break up buildings because these are spiritual things your worship is spiritual it's a spiritual weapon going to a spiritual heaven so it actually does warfare on the way up there so these are gamers and they're called couriers or courier angels [Laughter] Thank You Jen for your bit of humor that cloud was over our house and Jen did Photoshop it no a minion did not appear over our house I'll make that perfectly clear wearing a mustache and glasses but when your sisters writing children's books a children's author that's what you get that's her revelation of something in the heavens this is a pet portal if you look right above this black part right there's my thumb holding my cell phone up and we're driving in California on the way to do Francisco and the Holy Spirit said get a picture that cloud baked and then open it up I began to yell in the car oh my word there's a dog there's a cat there's a fish on the dog's head I see a horse's head I there were so many you see the cat to the right I mean it there's the cat is that a cat face right next to him to see the poodle you see the goldfish sitting on his head if God doesn't have a sense of humor what is that can I didn't do that I have been telling people trying to convince them that your pets go to heaven and not only that that this portal is your pets look down and see you on the earth and and and and and the Holy Spirit said get that picture and he said God said because you're willing to talk about them we thought you'd look we thought you show them and there's actually oh they do you see that poodle a cocker spaniel you see the cocker spaniel in the picture you see something standing on its nose it's some kind of little pet if you go down and over to the left you see like a golden retriever kind of a dog all the way down and keep going down down down over to the left laughs right there there's so many pets in that picture I think I counted 38 and that was when I was in Florida going down i-95 and we were passing into from Georgia into Florida and that pet portal was in the sky your pets go to heaven amen oh there's that picture that's in your and your booklet right here there's that picture right there and if you look see it looks like a heart again with the color around it that's a portal to heaven right above that is a bearded being looks almost like I call John back straight up from the center of the heart go back to the center of the heart and straight up in the in the middle and it'll over a little bit to laugh a little bit to laugh go right there that's his beard see the beard and then you see the face straight up in the middle where the look right there's an eye you went past his eye there's his face there's his hair right up from there is one that looks like Jesus right there there are 43 beings in that portal and I was standing on the little stoop that that black pastor stood on at the first school of Bethel school they had and the students wanted to explore the book of Acts and they wanted to see to get filled with the Holy Spirit and they weren't teaching that at that time and so they asked parem who ran that school can we pursue this and he said go ahead and pursue it and after pursuing pursuing it fell that's the portal the Holy Spirit came from it's still there from all those times it went from there to Azusa Street it fell first in the middle of America I went from there and that little black pastor was not allowed at the time to go in the room and sit down but parem knew enough not to not to mess with God's purposes so he said I'll let you sit out on this stoop and you can sit on the stool and I'll let you keep the door open so you can hear he got more than all the students in the school dead because of his hunger he sold totally gotten invaded with the Holy Spirit he took that from there to Azusa Street in California so this was a portal to open yeah and I and God let me get a picture of it so I'm standing looking up standing in that same spot even took a picture of the doorknob has so much glory in the doorknob but it's the same doorknob subject which of the doorknob and the glory is like coming off of what where he's held it open so he could hear truth that changed his life that started a whole movement of the Holy Spirit in our country Amen so that's that's the that's where I got that picture and put it in there so that's an open portal and let me see what time is it we're probably gonna happen Brooke yeah we're gonna have to rock it into the next thing so this is really just to acquaint you with the spirit realm around you it's more real than this natural realm and the way God created the natural realm was he spoke the word stepped out he took a scroll at first it looked like a drop of water because the River of Life flows from God he grabbed it and it was became a scroll he took it and he stretched it around the spiritual realm out in space and then that was the canvas for a physical realm that he could then put the planets in in the stars in and then God treated earth took one hand of water to put it on the earth where the landmass was one landmass and he and that one handful made the whole ocean and he made the earth and then before he remade it in verse 2 and so he created the heavens and the earth he he created you and birthed you from inside him he wants you to have truth and revelation so that you can be great for him in this time amen amen so I hope you enjoyed that we're gonna have is there something else I need to do before I do the laying on of hands oh okay we're gonna take up the offering and and either I can take it up or you you better are you sure you want me to take it I'm just gonna say when you invest in what God is doing it is powerful it you know we can give and it will be given unto you but when you give to what God is doing right then in the earth it gets multiplied even more because it's gonna go for his purposes and not just his purposes it's gonna be his will his way and this is what he sends to me he says if I send it I spend it and that's what I live by regardless of what I need or what I have to have I let God tell me how to spend it because you belong to him if you're giving it it's him sending it and if he sends it he tells me how to spend it and then I spend it where he wants it amen so if you want to give this is the time to give if you want to make checks that make it out to gateway gateway I'm not laying gateway on Mount Zion I'm sorry I'm yelling yeah why on everything everything goes to camp every day everything comes to me so if I know sometimes people I've seen people not trust places and they will walk up and give me money later you can trust this place okay you can trust them they are so hungry for revelation not many people would come and let me do this or even show you what you were shown because they would have fear that it was not true or that I was deceiving people I don't know how you can deceive people when you empower them bring them closer to God share who they were where they came from open up revelation in the Word of God tell you what time it is how to operate in it just be an agreement with God's Word that he gave to you tonight a man and so when you're ready we'll just go ahead and start taking it up so if you want to make checks out or give I greatly appreciate all of it I take seriously your giving of out of your own need especially we know in this world it costs money which is why the devil doesn't want you to have money well it's too late that's not going to work anymore it's a lie that we have to be poor to be holy you're holy because of the blood of Christ and almost everyone God used in the Bible either had money or he gave them wealth they were wealthy God loves wealthy people that love him because the money won't have you it's not money that's evil it's the greed it's the love of the money that's called green that's a flesh thing we talked about the spirit and the flesh greed is part of the flesh wanting to take over desiring things of the world just sometimes they already have stuff they just want more stuff because it's the spirit of greed they can't they can't stop doing it okay so it's about being selfish and wanting for yourself but if you want to help people to help empower them to bless them to build things in this time on the earth to help help support whole groups of missionaries send buildings there to be built on the property you know supply them the whole year they're there I'm not talking about hundreds of people are talking about one person can supply everything that whole group needs the whole time that they're there this is the time we're entering into where you will have wealth to go in and buy a city if you need it to for God he will he is going to buy up so many these major resorts I mean like ten star resorts that are not going out of business he's going to set up believers to go buy them transform them in and the orphanage is going to the streets and rescue 500 orphans put them in the best place they could live he'll have people ordered prepared to go in there and train them and teach them in the love of God they don't have to have little hovels to live in anymore because in this time we're gonna be demonstrating and representing heaven it's gonna be different we're gonna represent heaven heaven has the best there's no lack in heaven the best buildings the most beautiful landscapes the properties are the places to go to are the best of the best so for living on earth as it is in heaven we should have more do more and be boring man so father I thank you for blessing every person even because of the hunger they had tonight even because they stayed and didn't leave even if they didn't understand God I want you to fill them with revelation bring restoration to their families let them have encounters and counters with a Living God with the hosts of heaven God let them clearly see them over their home in the sky waiting to defend them to be sent on assignments god I thank you for increase in discernment and awareness of the spirit realm increasing and sound wisdom increase in every area of their life god this is the time for the more in every area for us to be above and not beneath because we live in Christ and he lives in us we're gonna manifest and demonstrate at the highest levels of authority with Christ in this world down long revelation on the word that the word come alive let it be a Living Word and a testimony in their lives god I thank you in every way to bless them and you will receive that say I receive it amen thank you God amen so we're gonna move this and so my plan is to lay hands if you've been here before I didn't importations it doesn't take as long I don't take five minutes to pray over every little person you're gonna all get the same thing you're going to get the same thing and it's all connected to understanding and receiving the right to operate in the spirit realm have revelation of the spirit realm have manifestations in the spirit realm that includes encounters and so that's what I'm in parting into you what I operate in I can impart and you've clearly seen I know something about it so that's what I want to impart to everybody here and I will stand in one spot and we have a line like the lunch line what we'll do we'll have people come up this side up that side and go down the middle yeah and what I'm gonna do is you'll walk up to me and I'll just impart it to you and then I'll turn around and part it into them and then you can go back I guess either are they done you can go to the products table or you can wait i bless everybody we've already blessed you so don't have to do that and tomorrow morning what time ten o'clock we have another service tomorrow probably something completely entirely different whatever it is will be amazing probably new revelation on heaven or even something for you so I just know it's gonna be good so are we gonna start with the back and everybody just comes up yeah they come up like you're going to launch okay you're going to come to get dessert so one behind the other okay and then you'll stop here and you both you'll face this way you'll face this way and you come all the way

has written on his side he is the king of spiritual kings and the Lord of spiritual lords that are the body of Christ who have said yes to him this is the holy time it's a great time it is a powerful time to demonstrate and manifest for your God you cannot remain the same you are not the same for all who hear this word you must say I'll receive it those who have not been running after this you get on that track and you run after it you must choose to be chosen no one can stop you from doing that yeah no one can stop you from putting your crown on but you must not look or listen to the doom and gloom you must not be into escapism but rolling this is time for operation we've had revelation it's been revealed to you the plans of God who you are where you came from and even your future you have

speaking amen [Music] amen we thank you for your presence [Music] the stand before the throne of God is a powerful life-changing [Music] your flesh dies I know a lot of people say you cannot see the face of God you will die you're right your flesh will die every thought you had of what was important what was great who you are what plans you had what you thought about others even those who attack you it dies it's like dust it's like it never existed when you're standing before the Holy One and you burn for him because you're burning with him our God has eyes of flames of fire that's his passion for all of us even those who don't know him he loves them we all came from him we chose different paths in our lives some of us just ran immediately after him some took the time to do it but they are now running after them but even if it's at the very end they run after him we all will receive a great reward he does not want you to remember your past when you did not belong to him neither does he want you to remember or talk about others paths their past before they belong to him we cannot repeat a matter we cannot speak against our sisters and brothers if they're born again now God remembers none of their past why can never happen we cannot hold things against people if they repented God and given their self to him it's like God said you remember it no more that means you act like it never happened that is love love is not just loving God and hating others that's not love because if he sent us to love and to be just like him then you have to forgive even if people have not said something to you even if they haven't said I'm sorry it happened you have to act like it never happened love does not remember that walking in real love is living the truth and loving others we cannot approve or agree with their sin not ever sin is sin last night he had me explained that making mistakes that's different than sinning making a mistake you just say I'm sorry that's an apology okay so you can apologize for things if there was no sin involved you don't have to repent for that but we have to be like him that's why he died he died to multiply himself it says don't think it's bad to count yourself equal with him or he would not have said we are joint heirs when the father said and the son know ye not that ye are gods they weren't saying that we were the god of everything they were saying that we are in their family we are many ones many and what they were saying was you have the right to have authority in the spirit realm you have the right to have power over all the part of the enemy you have the right to stop the storms to stop the earthquakes to multiply food to call those things to be not as though they were we can do that we are the father sons and daughters we're joint heirs with Christ he is our bridegroom [Music] we cannot say that we're sinners saved by grace anymore because you are not a sinner and if you say that you're talking about your past he does not want you to talk about your past if you talk about your past you will stay in that place and if you talk about other's pasts that are now believers you will stay in that time our words are precious but they're powerful we cannot ignore what the word says about our words everything he made he spoke into being you speak things into being whether good are not good if people are continually bashing you and hating you you have to forgive them but they themselves are putting themself into place they're not going to want to be in because there are consequences to sin even believers who do that are putting yourself in a place they won't want to be in and I pray for God to have mercy on them I've had to forgive a lot and act like it never happened even though those people may not want to even accept that that I pray for them for God to have mercy on them to forgive them for what they say against me or accuse me wrongly of because I tell you the persecution is the evidence that I am doing right if you're being persecuted God said count it as evidence that you're standing in the right place with him and he does not hold any of that against you and I even tell people don't even write it down what people have said against me I don't want you to write it down I have forgive them I want you to act like they never did it that's true forgiveness because then you won't repeating it later you won't be repeating it you really have to be like that if you're gonna represent him you can't decide to be that way one day and then walk in the flesh the next day when you do that you are stepping back you can't go forward in the kingdom making conquest for Christ crushing the darkness pushing it back speaking to the water the land the air if you're doing that going forward and then all of a sudden decide you're just going to get in the flesh and blasts people crush people with your words you have a step back into the flesh you stopped you stepped out of the spirit walking in the spirit you step back in the flesh this is life this is death you speak life you speak death you draw a life to yourself you draw death to yourself if you keep doing that you will not be fit that doesn't mean you won't be in heaven that doesn't mean he won't love you that means you are not fit to go forward and rule in the kingdom because when you do that there's really no forward motion this is what you're doing you can't go to the next level of glory if you're doing this all the time you're not going to be a good witness if you're doing this all the time people will not know or even believe that you belong to God if you love them one moment and then you're bashing them if you love strangers but you're bashing your own family you tell about Christ how awesome he is then you repeat everything wrong that your family members are doing you are going in the spirit and you're stepping in the flesh because your flesh wants to do that when you're walking in the spirit and going forward you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh and the more you walk in the spirit you begin to walk in his ways and you let him have his will and when you begin to do that consistently he will then give you his own thoughts you cannot ask for his thoughts you can ask for his way you can ask for his will and only when you begin to walk in that will he give you his thoughts and you want his thoughts the more you have his thoughts the more you will know him and understand him the more you will want to be like him and not yourself and what you actually becoming is the real you that is not touched or controlled by the flesh that then cannot be touched or controlled by the enemy because the enemy cannot use a dead person so when you die to yourself to your own will to your rights to your opinions to your attitudes when you die to that you get filled with him and the enemy will run from you because you have died that is a good place to be if I ever have a school it's gonna be the school of dying and if you don't come dead we will kill you because I love being dead when your dad things can't penetrate you the enemy can waste his time all day long trying to convince you of something and you can just flick him away and he will run people not waste his time on you trying to use you or control you he will have no control over you what we allow is what we have right now what we have done with our own will and chosen with our will makes us who we are right now as a man thinketh in his soul so is he if you don't like you change it say something different live differently don't let people you know what that means but it says got no me and take your crown that means if you let people wound you or hurt you or put fear in you your crown is sliding off your head and you let man do that man's words are not supposed to hurt us or control us we belong to the Living God we don't listen to hell we don't speak hell's language they have one language just called profanity if you have an issue with it get rid of it because what you speak here will draw the light or the darkness to you fulfilled with the light of God and you let darkness get in when the enemy comes to check you out he'll see gray you don't want him to see gray in use you cannot mix the light with the darkness it says don't hide your light how do you hide your light you're letting darkness in this is a holy time it's an exciting time it's a powerful time it is a humbling time if you all come believe before God then you don't have consequences this is a time of blessings this is God's time to bless us this is our time of great wealth great excitement great prosperity joy celebration creativity that's the time you're in right now we're not living in the past anymore we're whatever people judge us judged us as we begin to believe that God validates you not man there's a lot of profits that really only hearing God they may hear a word and give a word but if that were to crushes somebody that's mixed with man if you don't say humble before God especially as a prophet and you get filled with yourself and people begin to idolize you that voice that you hear gets really thin and you begin to mix it with your flesh and the word sounds good and it sounds right but what kind of spirit is this person walking in we can't let self rule us we all have wills we have a will we have a choice he made us that way on purpose even the Angels have a will the Angels have a soul they had to choose were they going to follow God or Lucifer every one of them in heaven was tempted and he won one third while he lived in heaven while all these dangers lived in heaven they knew God they knew he was a creator and yet they chose the lie and when you choose deception you become so deceived you can't see that you're deceived people believing these messages that say you can freely send all you want to and the grace will cover is alive from Hell and sometimes you can't convince them because they had said yes they have said yes the people have said yes I can live any way I want to it doesn't matter the blood of Christ set me free you need to keep your discernment sharp you need to stay in the word you need to have a time with God time with the Lord on purpose if you have to set a clock and say I'm meeting with you tonight at 10:30 and you go sitting-room and you wait and just say I am here if you have to do that for seven months two years three years I promise you one day he's gonna walk through the walls and you will see him face to face whatever it cost to know him it's worth it but in running after him you cannot abandon your family when you go to heaven this is what God will say to you he will not say how many people have you won he would not say how much have you given away to others he won't say that he'll say did you love your family well that's what he's gonna ask you the ones he gave us and put us together he chose before this earth was made who your family members would be he put you in a lineage he made you a generation of something and we are accountable for how we treat them we cannot force them to receive Christ but you have to love them you cannot enable them to stay in the place they are if they're in drugs or pornography or even crime don't give them a place to live with you you will enable them to stay right where they are when they're old enough to know better and understand and they don't want to go by the guidelines the God has given you to live by then they should not live with you it's true we had many people come and stay with us and if they didn't want to go by the guidelines God has set for our household we had to ask them to leave because they'll bring hell with them and you'll be battling it all the time so make sure you're hearing God clearly if he said you help this person and then ask him how do you want me to help them because some of this some of us have big hearts and it's hard not to just run get them and bring them in because you have such an awesome atmosphere presence of God in your home but you want to maintain that and if they're if they're saying yes to your help they should be willing to attend church they should be willing to read the Word of God they should be willing to allow you to pray for them and if they won't do those things then they don't have a right to be with you amen see if you have college-age kids that come home and bring their drugs with them don't let them stand at the door and say we love you but that cannot come in you cannot invite your friends over who are wicked or living evilly because you're helping them to stay in that place my mom would just say I'm giving you to God and he can help you but you cannot stay here if you cannot maintain this atmosphere that we have here I had a great mom was she's still here she lives with me she's still my mother although I'm 66 I'm still her daughter she absolutely loves my husband he is the head of our house right now which is very challenging right now since we all live in our office I kept telling God I wanted office is good change your home into an office you put everything in storage that is yours personally and you make this look like an office and we had 14 staff every room and that place is the office even our bedrooms have desks in it there are no beds in there we sleep on sofas or nice lounges but we obey we already know the place that he's going to give us a beautiful place beyond anything we could afford and we know he's going to give it to us but we obey when you set something so make sure you know what you really want when you ask him and not only that we have the staff around us all the time like running our microscope would you like to move 14 people in with you if we go off somewhere and we can't even say we're going back home we're going back to the office it's his office he can do what he wants to there that's why he trusts us because we've laid down our own desires and our life for whatever he wants whenever he wants it wherever he wants it so it's wonderful to share beautiful things to people about how grand and fill with splendor and not just peace but the absence of evil and fear heaven is it's wonderful to talk about these great days on the earth that is for everyone all of his children in this time he is offering you to live on earth as they live in heaven it's called heaven culture it's a new culture coming to the earth not created here but birthed from heaven and sent here for us to tell and show what heaven is who he is and who we are and when you choose to live that way you live free from sin free from lack free from fear free from the enemy and heaven comes in partners with you the angels are seen all the time in her home and around our home by people by the neighbors who aren't even Christians they either change or move really today my message for you is how to live heaven culture which also means to partner and command the army of heaven heaven did not create an army to protect itself god never created the army to protect him he made them he doesn't need their protection he made them for a purpose every tribe of angels angels are made in tribes some of those tribes are under Gabriel some are under Lucifer and some were under Michael my friends are the ones under Michael I know some of them by name because the father introduced me or jesus introduced me our Holy Spirit introduced me this is what happens when you become the friend of God you become a friend of heaven they celebrate your life because they know you're gonna speak only truth that you will forgive no matter what is said or done against you you will bring life and hope wherever you go that the glory will wash over people the anointing will wipe out the evidence of hell and hell will burn if they touch that anointing you know things about the past before the earth was made you're shown things about the future even the new earth God did that with many of his friends my dad was God's friend I found out about the Father the Son and Holy Spirit from my earthly father and his mother and we have seven generations of us who knew him most of them are living in heaven right now they wanted to go to heaven the other thing that the Lord is offering is if you want to remain till he comes again this is a new time a new time when the supernatural beyond your imagination will happen there is not one human on this earth that can gauge what the presence of God the Father does when it touches something but we will feel that on this earth all flesh will feel it that'll be a new day you've ever wondered about the baptism and fire it has not happened yet because you will know when it does you the day the Holy Spirit moved inside of you packed up his stuff and moved in you knew when that day was you knew when Christ became your Savior and then if you loved him to be your Lord that's a whole different thing you knew when that happened so when you get baptized in fire you will know it you will not have to ask someone do I have the fire of God because I've only had a measure of it I still remember the day the month and the year that happened to me when I received it I was in church and I was thrown and hid the usher behind me and through both of us back three or four rows into the congregation it burned me like a blowtorch it burned everything off the walls of my heart that was not God it took away the memory of some things that I didn't want it catapulted me out of this world into heaven my spirit man was taken out of me and it was taken back in time it was like you see on Star Trek or Star Wars when they go warp speed I watched he takes you back in time and we were flying at such a rate all I could see was light shooting at me Shh and I felt myself traveling it's the only time every time he catches me up in heaven I'm here and then I'm up there and he was taking me back because he was blessed that I had obeyed and said yes when he asked if I wanted that and for two weeks I could only speak in tongues my body was in the church shaking and they locked me in with a security guard my pastor was wise enough to not touch me they left a note stuffed up in the sleeve my daughter when my mother comes to and can crawl over to the side call this number my dad will come and get her guys probably they're like 10 hours or 12 hours my body shook the whole time it was the fire on me it's one of the evidences yo shake you'll burn your body will get so hot it will burn all fear out of you it'll burn out the fear of the face of man you'll burn fear out of the face of the enemy it will make you so bold you stand in the highest mountain until everyone around you about him all I talk about is a father son Holy Spirit heaven the future the new earth our weapons he's given us crushing the darkness not tolerating the enemy changing the atmosphere speaking to the ground so produce can come up speaking to the storms and the earthquakes and the tsunamis and avalanches even the fires it doesn't matter it can't a pulse you into a whole new place where you fear nothing because that fire you're gonna be baptized with comes from the heart of the Father the consuming fire that burns in him and outside of him that the Lightning shoots out of you may expect that to happen to you one day it's didn't somewhere a lightning bolt start shooting on you that's fine with me if he wants to do that I don't mind I don't mind you're not the same person and I only had a measure like a drop when that fire touches the people on this earth they're either gonna run into God or run to get away from it the enemy is terrified of that day he tear he's gonna be terrified he's gonna lose a lot of those who followed him a lot of the supernatural be seen openly angels will be seen everywhere moving and doing things with heaven really is invading this earth and then the veils gonna be ripped away and the spirit realm will be evident there's the convergence of the spirit realm into this natural realm it's gonna happen and no one can stop it from happening I'd rather be operating in it than be ignorant of it that's why we get baptized and fire it is literally a separate baptism the Holy Spirit looks like he's on fire all the time I see fire trails all the time in my house but when I go somewhere and sit and get up I see fire on that seat everything I touch I release it into it it can't be erased it can't be washed off it can never be watered down it's an eternal thing this is what he wants for everyone this is his passion for everyone to walk in that place I'm not so special that I have something you can't have but I chose it I chose it every time he asked me something I said yes so if you play with your foot half way in the world and half way in heaven you're not gonna go anywhere because you're also like this you get pulled from this side then your friends are something influential to go over here or you watch a horrible demonic movie with graphic violence profane language and sexuality you're gonna be pulled way over here because it goes in your soul what you watch goes in your soul well you here goes in your soul what you say goes in everyone's soul that's in hearing distance it goes in your own soul you have layers in your soul so whatever you Lao on those layers that get stored there that's why you can remember things your your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choose to do or not to do to say or not to say to hear or not to hear you're the right to tell anybody who's using profane language I'm sorry but you know I don't listen to health language and I'd like to spend time with you but but you know I have to go because I'm guarding my soul I let God use my soul if you'd like to do that let me know because if you stand there and just allow and allowing allowing it you're filling it in your soul eventually it will come out of your mouth amen so this is a new way to live it's a lifestyle change you're not here getting a just a Bible meeting this is not something just to try to remember some scriptures that's not why I'm here I already did that growing up the word lives in me it comes out of me all the time because I put it there but I've guarded my heart and my soul for a long time and I realized even in high school I didn't have to be around people that did stuff I was never part of a group or a clique I didn't do drugs that happened started in the 60s when I was in high school I didn't tolerate it and they found out real soon if they asked me they would never ask me again so I set a boundary boundaries for myself I wasn't forced to take those boundaries but I set them for myself and I stuck to them because I realized even back then I knew there was a god I really believed you saw everything that I did or thought and I knew my own angels because I'm a seer we're with me all the time they live with you give them some slack okay watch something good say something good someone wants to fight don't fight with them your angel will be cheering you on and applauding you for speaking life when they're giving you death and do you know that when someone's bashing you to your face you begin to say how much God loves them you're piercing their soul with those words and those words won't leave their soul and there's something in there that can fight the darkness in them I've seen people in these fights domestic fights or just fight somewhere you know screaming at each other little demon sits here and pricks that person who's angry or upset and says to them I hate you I can't stand you I don't ever want to see you again and out of their mouth I hate you I can't stand you I never want to see you again and when the person across them starts yelling back they're doing that because this demon jumped to the other person's over one little demon this big they'll prick them and give him the answer and the answer will shoot out of their mouths and escalates and then they're screaming really horrible things and all is this demon jumping back and forth picking them laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing that they are now controlling those people whether they are a believer or not you give permission so don't do it no matter how hard it is turn around and walk away because you can stop that stuff we have a choice to participate or not participate these are all keys to walking in the spirit the morning you choose God's Way and not your flesh our man's way the more you learn how to walk in the spirit in this in walking in spirit is more important than having encounters being taken to heaven having all the wealth of the world given to you having great influence over people being in a high position it's more important to walk in the spirit than any of those because in your life God can use in great ways and you have the most unexpected things happened to you because you're walking in the spirit and you're not fulfilling the desires of the flesh amen because what you get in return is worth everything it's worth everything you live in his presence all the time your discernment becomes extremely sharp and people won't be able to lie to you you'll know what they're thinking before they say something jesus knew the thoughts and intents of everybody's heart when it talks about the heart in the Bible they're talking about your soul why do they do that because you're a living soul you are a living soul people have described their self many ways and held army but when he made add-on what did he call Adam a living soul when we lived in God we we had a soul but we didn't need to use it we need to decide where are we gonna live what are going to eat what are we gonna do we didn't have to make in those decisions he was our world he was our very place of existence and him we lived we moved we had our very being but when when Adam was formed and the in Christ made him the word made him when God spoke the word made Adams body and then the father leaned over and breathe Adams little spiritual being into his nostrils and he became a living soul who would then be accountable for his actions his choices what he was thinking what he was doing what he was displaying because the other part of your will is what you display in your emotions so people know what's in your soul and one day the father showed me people walk up and they'll go what's in your layers they won't say what's in your wallet they'll be talking about the layers of your soul if you're displaying something that is not displaying haha you're you're enraged something or you just try mashing people or you're spewing not heaven all over the welcome to go so what's in your layers because what I see is not God because one day at least all the body will know how their soul is made and the Father said it will change the way the body of Christ lives when they realize what they're allowing in there is causing them to think or act a certain way and you can change that you made trauma that wasn't your fault you were innocent of it but it still was recorded in your soul even if that abuse wasn't against you and you saw what that was recorded in your soul and it can control you for the rest of your life if you let it but you don't have to let it you can choose with your own will to loose that trauma from your soul like it never happened because living heaven culture means you're using the keys to the kingdom every day of your life this is a lifestyle he wants you to have any lifestyle if you can live on earth as it doesn't happen that means something is going to have to change is that right we had to have new things to understand how we could put our self in that place and not be affected by hell or man the main way you do that is to keep all their junk out no fear no offense no unforgiveness no drugs no bashing no doom and gloom no fear at all no one's words that are being said to you no matter how bad they are you loose every word they spoke every word sound image frequency thoughts or actions of hell or man you can loose them from yourself all day long if you have to and you'll walk so free and your life it will be like you're living in heaven they have a protocol to do this you get filled with grace every day well I have grace I'm gonna be saved yeah you are saved you have eternal life right but there's another kind of life you can live - it's called abundant life there's great fun dn't life if you know living in abundant life you aren't asking for that grace where is it in the word or my throne of grace to find Grace and help in time of need you need help when someone's bashing you you need help when you solve some traumatic thing or some actions or images that you didn't want to see what you see goes in here does it say the eyes are the window to the soul that wasn't just a remark that was truth so your own self what you choose to watch you're gonna be held accountable for that you don't want a lot darkness in the father said this to me one day it's not that people or businesses or churches cannot win but somebody in leadership or chose to let darkness get in it will affect you it'll affect your whole life if you're the head of your household it will affect your whole family because then you're carrying it with you and if you minister and you got it you're giving it to people if you're raising the family it's going to affect everybody in there because you allow things of the enemy to come in if you watch horrible things on television when your kids go to sleep you still let the enemy come in amen we allow or don't allow if you've been doing that go home open the door your house and you dipped all the enemy that you have let in there I'll go in people's home sometimes and I'll see like demons standing right next to the television they're not visitors they're residents because of what was continually watched in the home if you ever buy a home that someone else lived in make sure you cleanse it because the atmosphere remains you're moving into it it's there I don't go into a hotel without kicking everything out of the entire hotel and every room of every every room in the hotel no matter where I'm staying I'm not living with hell you don't know what they watched in those television you don't know what they did in those rooms you don't know what they said in those rooms because I can go to a place and hear words that were spoken for years ago friend of mine brought to me - let me see their new school facility and it was where the offices were and the wherever I can't remember a lot of human man things but it's where you come in to sign in you know where they read stuff the offices whatever I went in there and I heard prayer like I've never heard before I had images of people laying on the floor crying out to God like hundreds out there it was a huge place they're crying out to God calling in the move of God calling hope for the people that were there and crying out for their families and I said what was this place before they said well it's all remodel them and I'm not talking about the Tilton what was here what was done here they said why and I told him what I saw and they began to cry there but this is their 24 hour of prayer house all those prayers that ascended to heaven were also still there so words remain and some of them you wear on your garments the Bible says do not touch a garment spotted by the flesh people come in my office I see words on them I hear words that they weren't saying then my people that my staff know that if I sit in their chair I'll hurt every word they said the night before I will see every image of what they watched the night before because the more you become like Christ you know the thoughts and intents people's are and sometimes you wear it on the outside of you it's a garment it's been spotted by the flesh so if you buy stuff from the thrift store and I'm saying that because I love to go treasure hunting I don't have to but I love it I will cleanse everything I buy whether it's a trinket or a piece of clothing or anything else that I take from there I cleanse it for the kingdom I pick it up I cleanse this for the kingdom it removes everything that was ever spoken that was in the presence of something this is what the spirit realm is all about this is why you need to recognize the spirit realm is real and you don't see it with your physical eye but it's real and things remain that you release in that spirit realm it's wrapped all around this physical round when God when God was in heaven there was nothing but his home his world called heaven there wasn't anything there wasn't the planets there wasn't this earth there was nothing and the word would step inside the father and he would go somewhere where there's nothing and the father would speak and the world would step out make it that's why the word says there wasn't anything that was that wasn't made by the work he was called the word because he took his words and made them that's how that's done when he said Jesus said to the Father you and me and me and you that's what he's talking about they went someplace together and created together but the spirit realm is the original round it's not just the other realm it's not just some kind of round it is the permanent eternal realm that existed before this physical world was here and when God spoke the Lord the word there was a little drop of water and from it he pulled a scroll and he took the scroll and opened it like a curtain and wrapped it around the spiritual realm that's why at the end he said I will take it and fold it away like an O garment he's talking about the physical realm talking about the plan that's this earth people don't like it when I say there's gonna be a new words you should celebrate if God's gonna make it it would be better than this one and people go oh no the very core the center will remain it doesn't matter he says he's folding it all the way like a garment you know why he knows where the ends are and he'll just fold it up and go away and create a whole new thing he knows that things remain in that spirit realm and people always talk about well you know my dead relative is living in my house and they turned the lights off and I bump things no that is not your dead relative no one remains on this earth when they die they go one place or the other their body may die and be buried but their spirit man which is very much alive remains either in heaven or in hell and I've seen both you want heaven because in heaven you just to live and hell there's not even existence let alone living it's as real as heaven is and what we say and do with their life will attract one side or the other that means your angels are with you all the time but if you're doing something wrong the demons are laughing at your angels this is a real life this is this is truth you want truth you couldn't get all the truth that's why we're held accountable and the thing is when you begin to walk in the spirit you have learned the joy of obedience when you walk in the spirit there's not consequences it's a place you've lived in John was Indy say it loud on the Lord's Day so he wasn't in the flesh he was in the spirit that's when you heard and saw the door open and the voice all that that was in the spirit when he was walking in the spirit he probably wasn't even on the Isle of Patmos he was the closest disciple to Christ he got as close to him as he could he wanted to be just like him and this was one of the sons of thunder who couldn't wait to fight with his brother over girls he was so changed by Christ by following Christ believing Christ he believed he had risen from the dead remember that John the Beloved the one Christ loved the one who loved Christ I love all the little tags he gave himself didn't even say John the one who loved Christ the one whom Christ loved where he loved all the disciples but the one who stays the closest gets the most of him he even took John back in the past how do I know because he couldn't make that statement John couldn't state make that statement the Word was with God and was God and there was nothing that was made that the word didn't make he would not have known that unless he was shown that he also knew the word became flesh he knew who Christ was before he was Christ still same being but the word was all spirit he didn't have flesh on him he didn't even look the same Satan did not recognize him he kept trying to figure out who he was do you realize that even on the Mount of temptation he but they didn't know who he was but he was trying to find out because his features weren't the same as when he was the world because John became a friend not just a disciple did you become God's friend he shows you things and he takes you places he always did that in the past he hasn't changed he still does it amen so that's why we need to be accountable and really care not feel like we're being commanded to do it or forced to do it guys drink some water one day I believe I won't have to eat or drink I've only eat of him and drink of him and heaven you don't have to you eat because you want to not because you have to even God likes to eat does she Christ Christ got ruined by the sweets his flesh wanted the sweets I don't think he much cared when he was just in the spirit all the time but when he came to this earth grew up like we did he fell in love with sweets blame your sweet cheese on him we are joint heirs with Christ I don't know very many people that don't like sweets I will raise my hand who likes sweets let me see your hand chocolate especially if they had money in heaven it would be chocolate and they have chocolate because I have had it I've had pizza and chocolate ice cream in heaven [Applause] whether it's barbecue or steak salmon fried chicken without the fixin everyone in the South loves fried chicken I may have been born in the north but I've been raised in the South y'all I do like fried chicken I eat it in moderation eat everything in moderation choclate cakes yours good the special things in habit well I only talk about the things I like I I do know this it is so worth it to give yourself to Christ and gain heaven and the new one will be even better I've seen the one that's here let me tell you there is nothing that can compare with it down here especially the food no weight gain no food allergies don't have to worry about gluten-free stuff or the fat or the sugar amen it will not affect you in any wrong way I will say this to start with they don't kill animals to feed you in heaven those animals would be yelling at you you are not taking my life your pets if you're feeding yourself where's my food and I'm not eating on the floor anymore God has the greatest sense of humor because all your pets are there and yes they will talk to you being nice to them they will have good memories of you they're taking over your mansion whether it was a zebra a chimpanzee a goldfish your 20 cats every raccoon you saw dead in the road and you said you poor thing it went to your mansion you will have many more than you had on this earth but there will be plenty of room for them all oh I we haven't I've already seen Charlie in heaven I saw our pet alligator in heaven yep charlie yeah max the duck Maggie that you can I can go on and on I don't have enough time today to tell you about our pets and you got 15 kids you got a lot of tats my dad loved nature too we gave away alligators alligator turtles all kinds of owls those weird black birds that peck holes and everything pileated woodpeckers Thank You Holy Spirit we had him in our house they were in a pen we made a big mistake by putting newspaper between the pen and the wall they thought the print was bugs we had about a thousand holes in the wall when we finally gave them to the zoo and they were like this big we got him this big Thank You months of the zoo we kept giving to the zoo all the time so all the light all the light is a substance in heaven everything is made out of light in heaven your clothes your own being is made of light God is light right Christ is the light of the world you're made out of light your spirit man is made out of light man created to live in a spiritual world the water is light the crystal sea is made out of light your mansions are made out of light your steak your salmon whatever it is you like to eat barbecue you know if you like Asian food they have all kinds of food everything you like and love is there I like the desserts I want my mansion felwood deserves their cakes are this big around and this high one cake and you slice this piece of chocolate cake it's this big here's a piece of cake you can actually eat the whole thing you eat it you leave it sitting there no there's no guilt no one's guilty in heaven you go on a tour of heaven and leave that cake sitting right there when you come back eventually there's a whole cake there the missing piece was replaced your cake never runs out or your apple pie whatever it is that you like it won't run out amen and this is the best part I actually was invited by the Lord to go to someone's home that was living in heaven they didn't see me nobody in heaven sees me when he takes me there he hides me in heaven because if he did not they know what I do down here they know I go there and come back here they would be chasing me down the streets of gold handing me pictures of their family members with their names written on it their addresses because they know where you live and their phone numbers and they would say please go tell them I love them I'm making plans for them I'm so excited for what they're doing today I can't wait to see them again that's what they say they get a little singing a pom quarter I don't know what you call it and every time I see a place you would like they put it in this when you come up in heaven they'll hit it here comes this list and then want to take you to every one of those places and taste all these different foods from different bakeries different restaurants I was invited to this place and I saw this dining room in a mansion would see 100 people and all the tables were set like a king's banquet and all the family members and friends and the prophets and the Apostles all came we're coming to eat at this person's home and everyone sat down and they still think God for the food isn't that awesome and then they said what they want it appeared on everybody's plates to perfection Meiji perfection the best tasting none of it was ever left on anybody when you ate it and we're done it all disappeared off the plates nobody cleaned it up there is no garbage in heaven there's no waste in heaven say that's heaven that's where I'm gonna live one day don't worry about your little grandma she's not up there scrubbing dishes for a hundred people but I know some grandmas that love to entertain and actually cook cooking is our gift they will have a fully supplied kitchen three times bigger than this room is their kitchen and there'll be appliances and weird things there that we never had in the search that they use to prepare all the food and what they're given is not like real animals that died it looks like it because it's made out of light they put in their order the angels deliver the food and the groceries whatever they need vegetables doesn't matter what it is side dishes the entrees the desserts but this grandma that was a grandma that now looks 25 is going to cook for all 100 people and she I saw her I saw her in her kitchen she's gonna make salad and they had salad bowls like this she was slicing cucumbers as she sliced a cucumber and the peel came off it disappeared there was no trash whatever she peeled off it disappeared and she was just singing and so happy some new family members they come in to heaven and she was throwing a party for them that's what she was doing so there was no waste there was no garbage but what was left was the best meal they ever had so that's like what happens when you go to visit someone in heaven and that awesome it is worth everything you live in the manifest presence of God his presence is in your furniture piss in your floor's it's in the walls even the walls of your home will worship God the streets of gold worship Him every pebble in heaven has a face and they worship God the flowers sing the trees sing is a powerful beautiful place to live and they are watching our lines now they don't see a lot of the tragedies that happened and they don't see every sin that somebody committed because it's time to celebrate but they know what God's plans are for you and they would declare over you every day amen if you were angry please please hear this if you had a fight with them and then they died and you didn't get to say you were sorry they already forgave you and if you mention it to them they won't remember it when you get there they'll be so happy to see you if it makes you feel better just look up and say I'm so sorry Bob that fighting out there they're gonna go what was that I don't remember that they'll remember every good and happy thing that you did every gift you gave them every time you kiss them every time you hugged them they love you more now than they did when they were here because now they're filled with that love this is how while the love of God is there can be somebody who killed somebody and that person went to prison and that person in heaven will pray all the time God's let them know you I forgive them I want them to know you they need to know you and they will pray over that person all the time to know the Lord send someone to talk to them let your spirit go consume them but let them know you that's how much they love him that person gets saved in prison they go home to heaven they are best friends best friends best friends that's how far-reaching the love of God is that's why he wants us to live the way I've been talking to you about our life is a witness it's a testimony of who we are of who he is and you need to know all this because one of the most powerful things we do so there's a protocol in heaven if you want to live on earth like they do in heaven every morning when you get up before you get out of pad this works I get more emails about this one simple thing that anything else God has me teach people it's the scripture about the throne of grace you yourself every day of your life can be filled with fuel from heaven that will be poured into your being that will make you feel different act different think different and you won't show up at your friend's house heaven well it's real simple the Bible says that the father filled his own son with that grace he didn't have to fill a son with eternal grace but he had to have grace for abundant life because then he could tell people I come to bring a life and life more abundantly you know what abundant life is it's being free from all kinds of things that come you face every day everyday normal things you go to work people are egging where you're getting blamed for something you didn't finish something you're getting blasted by somebody or ridiculed by somebody if you are filled with that grace from heaven it won't even touch you it won't it's hard to even be afraid or get afraid because fear can't penetrate it it's heaven in you by simply saying every morning I asked for father because remember we're talking about his throne father everybody say it father say it loud father I asked for and receive grace for this day amen and right now in my being I feel it being porn in it feels like light electricity I literally feel if I said or five times a day I would feel it coming in its fuel and it only comes from one place heaven how simple is that it did not cost you a dime nothing it cost you nothing it is free ask for it you have not this is one major thing to living on earth as they do in heaven because they're filled with that all the time they walk in it all the time there's nobody nobody gets angry in heaven no one's fearful nobody has regrets nobody's condemned nobody is rejected there's no room for it because they are filled with heaven you can have that on earth as it is in heaven that is the number one thing you learn about living on earth like they live in heaven I had to do all these I do every one of them the second one was loosening stuff from your soul it's called a soul checkup and I don't do it every now and then I probably do it 15 times a day because of who I am and what I'm confronted with I don't keep anything inside of me that people say in emails and comments on the phone in person through a second or third person I don't keep it I don't want it I don't have to keep it so as soon as something happens I go I choose to lose all those words unkind harsh negative judgmental words I loose them from my soul right now I will not keep them and I bind to my soul the love and the life of God and then I'm joyful all the time I've already got fuel from heaven now I'm not keeping anything in my soul the keys to the kingdom what you loose on earth will be loosed from and heaven will come and pull it out because Christ is the restorer of our soul if you have cares you cast them on him he comes and pulls them out but it's the keys of the kingdom you bind and you loose I bound the devil for years most intercessors buying the devil all the time you can buy them if you want to buy grab the loose in light of my life I know my family's life I'd rather loose invite in my home and then buying the things of God because what you lose from your soul leaves what you bind in your soul will remain if you want to be happy this is this is real this is real this is how we live on earth as we do in heaven we do these three there's three things it's a protocol first when you get right second one you don't keep anything in your soul you don't want there and the first time you do it every trauma you ever had is gone it can even addictions we've even had witchcraft spirits loose from people's soul when they chose chose to loose it from their soul it's gone like it never happened what you loose on earth is loosed from heaven like it never happened what you bind on earth it will be bound and written down in heaven you can find the life of God the love of God the presence of God the celebration the expectation the creativity is unending and guess what you have it in there and then you will live like that that's what you think on it's what you choose it's what you're going to demonstrate with your emotions if you love joy and happiness and a great future and your gift being used you can bind every one of those to your soul and he was trying to teach us something when he said don't let the Sun go down upon your wrath otherwise it will stay and yourself and you'll get up in the morning and you'll be angry and you'll think about it you talk about how angry are your filling the layers of your soul with anger then you can stay angry then you'll be so angry nobody wants to be around you what is in there is what you will become so don't let it stay you don't have to keep it you don't have to keep depression oppression despair or suicidal thoughts you can loose every one of them from your soul the father spent four earth hours teaching me about the keys to the kingdom he said because you're willing to listen I'm gonna show you who Mel cuz if it is she came your promises because I'm gonna have you trained everybody everywhere you go you're gonna train them how to do a soul checkup it will change the way the body of Christ lives they won't need deliverance they won't need six weeks of counseling because they won't keep anything in them he said and when people who do counseling learn to do this those people won't have to come back for a second visit I have amen I have youth centers youth centers youth and by me to come and train all their workers how to do this and they're crying the entire time they say when you youth come to us it's on drugs and they're in despair it takes it's a year just to get them free we'll do in five minutes they can have the whole year to get stronger and more powerful in God and know who they are without carrying that and that's what's happening these places are getting undone I was shown the future I saw in businesses in churches a little thing on the door that says soul doctor you all need to be so doctors God calls me a soul doctor I saw them even businesses had them because when people get undone or sad or broken you're not a good worker you're actually not good for much of anything you're in a pitiful place I know I worked in a law firm and the ones who did the family law the divorces and all that stuff like that they were always so burdened down because they're carrying all that inside of them they could be free in five minutes free from homosexuality we have a young person in Lamar Missouri just because they lose two from their soul it ran out of them and they have never had any of those feelings emotions again it is powerfullest like you mix the greatest deliverance and intercession that you could possibly do or look for in the earth is available to you personally every intercessory group needs to know about this it changes the way you pray for people how you feel yourself you can't carry those burdens I know someone who was so burdened down with everybody's problems and things you were going through she's a powerful woman of God it aged her so much she went around sad and just broken and I said you cannot live like that anymore God didn't tell you he had to carry those things she loosed him off from her soul and now she has a whole new life it will change the way we live as the body of Christ and the third thing you taught me was how to invite heaven's army to be my weapon and command the army I don't have time to read every scripture that talks about us commanding or being commanders there are many there are many scriptures in the Bible to talk about that I love the one where God said come in-you me that means you're supposed to be a commander that doesn't mean you're gonna tell him what to do that means you're gonna say what will happen people we can't do that what is called those things that be not as though they work we're saying something right there to create something right there you should eat the works of your mouth you know that that's because what you're saying whether good or bad is what you're gonna have we're already using our mouths to create but we need to command command Satan to get out of your face get out of your home to get out of your finances but we're not supposed to fight him our battle is the spiritual battle is that true we do not wrestle against the flesh but we spend so much time fighting each other we don't do anything against the enemy amen it's really simple there's another provision protocol in heaven you have to invite we didn't have Christ until we invited him is that true amen we didn't have Holy Spirit until we invited him during 12 us is that true we were asking so we received the same thing goes for the angelic you have to invite them to be your weapon when the word says that our weapons they are Mahdi it doesn't say it not saying your weapon isn't it it says they who are they who is created informed by God to fight the darkness the army they are our weapons who pull down the strongholds of darkness around us who shred the platforms that demons have been ruling from for years but they were not given permission to just go attack on the road and say they are a military a military needs orders they need the authority of your person giving the orders so who has given authority over the darkness say it loud so we've been given the power say we have a power given to us by Christ that is over all the power of the enemy you can say Christ commanded the host even as a righteous man when he's being judged by the Sanhedrin he said if I wanted to I could call the army of heaven to fight on my behalf he was showing us we had the right to do that so if we have the power over all the part of the enemy which by the way we're not using it or we wouldn't be harmed just to say that in the word I'll give you power over the brother noon you know I know about the stepping on things and all that but at the end of it scripture says and nothing by any means shall harm you Luke 10:19 he wasn't just telling us a nice story he was showing us who we were so if he did this even walking as a man he could come in the hosts are we joint heirs did he say what I did you can do that gives us permission that gives us permission we are not under the Angels we are over them we lived in God we are his offspring they're not his offspring they were all created for a purpose if one third of them were created just to fight the darkness well it's not in heaven no not theirs being threatened but he comes here the enemy to kill steal and destroy that doesn't mean we have to let him we are concerned royalty we have a kingdom that I'm talking about right now living heaven culture is operating in the kingdom the pearl of great price sell all you have just to get that that means give it all up you're flush especially yours you're flush your mind says stop having to justify everything if God's given it to you you just take it and then you do it because having heavens army to command them the number one thing they're going to protect is you and I and my husband will testify have not been attacked by Satan in six years is this true yes it is true because why I use the army and I command that and when you invite them to be your weapon because you have to invite you get 100 members of heavens best assigned to you and they will live in the sky over your home they won't come and fight and go back to heaven they're being assigned to you every King has an army but if that King just sat there even in the natural for King and then after sat there and did nothing with their army they would be run over they'd be robbed from they'd be killed than having stolen from this is this true that's what we've been doing that's why we need revelation revelation changes everything revelation on the Word of God revelation honoring God what who he says we are revelation on what heaven is what the spirit realm is where our rights are what our Authority is where our weapons are that doesn't mean you don't use the blood of Christ the Word of God doesn't mean you're not going to use them but add this weapon to it and this army harkens unto the word of the Lord now I know you think that just means Jesus Christ we are spiritual Lords under the Lord of lords and we are kings spiritual kings under the King of Kings he didn't write down on his side cuz he was talking about King David or Solomon it was us in this time on the earth literally ruling with him we don't have any of that authority without him but he gave it to us you do really simple you choose with your will to invite heaven's army to be your weapon and then you thank God and then 100 members are signed to you immediately and then you learn how to send them an assignment you have to give them orders you couldn't go to our military here and send them some more and not have a written out by someone who has the authority to give the orders and they decide they don't decide I'm going to do this order but not that one they can't do that oh well we're gonna do this but we don't want to do that one we're just gonna do this and go back their butts would be in trouble they would get chewed out they'd have all kinds of things assigned to them that they don't want to do I'm talking about the Earth's military my husband's a Marine once a marine always a marine oh he had training in Parris Island he knows exactly what I'm talking about they can't decide to do things on their own they have to go to the ones who have the authority to give the orders we are the only ones who have authority to give the orders I'm not saying Christ can't be ternoon that forever he is now saying as joint years you're doing this if you want to not be attacked or not harmed or not having stolen from you that army will keep it from happening they can bring back wealth that was kept from you you can send them in all the traffic and they'll do traffic control and you will never have an accident never the only time I've ever was when I forgot or when he forgot never that's part of what they do for you amen and then you have to keep doing it this isn't a one-time thing you do it every day you be strategic make a list you know what where do you send them wherever the army of darkness is doing something especially wherever you go send them before you every day even when you're on vacation when you're going into a meeting to decide if you're gonna get the loan or not send the host in there to give you favor they'll speak to the people like this I like these people I'm just gonna say yes I'm really serious they will give you favor they will open doors for you doesn't this sound like a wonderful plan they will you can send them to your College your students College wreak havoc on health what he'll have a bad day let the professor's be confounded by the words that come out of your child's mouth they'll have to give them favor even if they don't like them even if they don't know them you won't get attacked by people bombarding you with hell when you go in to sign into the lobby if a people used to tell me all the time am I to go to the restaurant and get attacked by people that the clerk doesn't like me that the waitress doesn't like me the hotel clerk just crushed me we'll send the host before you go in there don't ever buy land well setting the host into the deal we're sending you I command you to go in there you find out anything that's not legal that's not right you expose it let me know if it's okay I'm getting that deal that's why they're here who wouldn't want to live like that say in heaven they have no problems they're never turned on or rejected they never have traffic jams everyone chose them favor on earth as it is in heaven and he even made that possible why not 30 years ago because this is the time he chose to call the kingdom age when we would visibly be seen operating in that spiritual Kingdom there proof will be our life how it is live what we are able to have that's the proof it works and I had to live every single bit of this then I'm telling you if you're married this is a free tip please love each other my husband would laugh every time you'd hear me say this and since he knows that he really uses it all the time the Holy Spirit came to me and he said these were lacking anything this is what you do when the love goes out the supply comes in if you're not loving you're not gonna get supply so if you want something love even more I'm talking about between husband and wife you know what I'm talking about say Amen yeah stop making war by fighting and start loving and make warfare there's like three things I have a CD back that are called passionate power it is powerful when you love one another it's almost the highest level of warfare you can make for your children for your marriage for your finances if you're mad at each other loose it from your soul and bind the love of God the passion of God for your spouse to your soul it'll change your marriage in every way all three of these things if you live them as a lifestyle you will never fail the enemy will be terrified at you hell would not want to be around you but the host will love living with you so if you wanted to do that stand up leave without that army and I want to tell you this you can get strategic and make a list and even when the Isis were everywhere my favorite thing to do is I would command my host to go boating on the Strongs the strongholds of Satan commanding the ISIS and fear would fall on them and then I would say go house that the ISIS have a severe crisis and they begin to find weapons abandoned in the desert in the Mideast they didn't know what happened the ISIS would drop their weapons and run because my host went there they pulled down all the demonic controlling them it's always about the spirit of darkness I didn't fight against the flesh I was fighting with the army against the spiritual darkness they pull down the strongholds those those those Isis had no power from Satan because they couldn't hear they were removed fear and confusion falls on them even in games the same thing happens and gangs and Marauders and all kinds of drug lords and human trafficking everyone doing heaven human traffic ministry they need to have an army wherever evil is you can send them but especially around you your household your family your close friends I send them all the time and the Wyss White House I went there in person and I asked for sentinels to be posted all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue all the way through them all through the through the Capitol Hill all the way up to the White House to protect Trump this was before the election and I saw them visibly being posted there to protect and keep him and his family and pens and his family because pence will be our president after Tonks terms two terms are up and they already have the host all around them you can post them places and so there's a protocol wouldn't you invite them so if you want to do that we're going to choose to invite them say I choose with my will to invite the host of heaven to be my mighty weapon I receive them in Jesus name Amen well now you all have 100 members if you're both sided you have 200 if you're children I said it with you we have 10 year olds a command an army from heaven 10 and 8 year olds that command their army is probably into the millions by now because they've been doing it for years they're growing up knowing these truths they lose stuff from their soul they asked for grace every morning they're living already on earth says they live in what are they going to be like when they're 40 relentless against the enemy speaking to the mountains and their cast into the sea that's what they'll be doing and no one can tell them that you can't do that they didn't argue in their mind about it they didn't say oh no that is not scriptural I don't want to write No my pastor doesn't teach that no I'm not going to do that I don't believe that I said you can choose it or you can die because then this time there is great darkness being loosed on the earth great deception great darkness but when you live on earth as they live in heaven it won't touch you so we are now going to send our armies you say Jesus I take power over all the power of the enemy attacking me my family my household my finances my body my destiny I command the hosts of heaven to go right now hold on every stronghold of Darkness shred every platform the enemy's been ruling from for years against me and my family and I command them you trash those demons you bash those demons you throw them in a dry place and have fun doing it go home make toast I can tell you they sing they sing while they do it because they have been waiting for ages to do this oh they whistle they whistle and if I'm really ticked off with the enemy I'll tell them to spit on them and then I'll say tell them I sent you I wanted them to know that I sent them we're supposed to we're supposed to commend we are not under hell's foot hell is our doormat we are not doormats [Applause] when it says turn the other cheek that doesn't mean you stand and let them beat you to the ground that means you decide not to blast them back God didn't ever say to us tolerate sin beating you up I'm talking about humans now he never said that and as a matter of fact in marriage he never told the husband or the wife that you had to tolerate sin in their lives they're running around if they're beating you that is sin he didn't say to submit to their sins if they're doing that it's okay to leave if it's your property tell them to leave I had a face-to-face encounter with Jesus Christ telling me that I was I was married once before a long time ago was a big mistake wasn't God's choice and for six and a half years I was beat up with words and crushed almost to nothing and in this is a believer I was married to and I never asked God so finally he he walks to the wall of my been home and says and I finally said to God what do I do about it and so he walks through the wall he goes now you're asking me you're asking me now because that was not my choice he said so you go break your contract this part really surprised me go break your contract you made with him because the word says what God has joined together let not man put asunder it didn't say anything about one man put together and people are getting married everywhere all day no love there's no love a covenant is between you and God loving one another honoring one another not beating some up like a doormat or you want to take advantage of them or you think they're going to make your life easier that is not a wise thing to do because your life will be miserable it'll be like you're in prison and then it will end up being not good at all no if you didn't know I can hear people's thoughts if you didn't know about that and you have a wonderful marriage of somebody even if they're not a believer then let them remain that's what the word says right it's going to honor God if they're gonna love you if they're going to love you and and you don't have they're not sinning all over the place then they can state God will accept that marriage but for me he had somebody and he said this is what the Lord said to me if you do not break that contract and end that contract and you'll have to go repent to him when you said you loved him you did those marriage vows you didn't mean them you'll have to repent and I did I went to repent you see the blender at me not him do the blender at me and I ended the contract and then I didn't want anybody I didn't want anybody and God said no I have somebody for you and is absolutely necessary for you to marry them if you're going to complete your destiny because with the other one you would have never completed it I could understand why I wasn't doing anything wrong I just didn't ask that's an important thing to know if it's God amen and if you both were not saved at the time you got married God will still honor that but when you know who better and you should have asked so when I met him oh man was he good luck oh he still is we've married 40 years when I met him he didn't know who Moses was he didn't didn't know anything you probably better he didn't have any religious baggage number one that's what God said oh no he'll become a mighty man of God but you are marrying him because you get your place where you let God tell you what to do if you've died then he tells you what to do and if you obey it's gonna be good he said no your marrying him I picked him when you were still in me you have to have him to complete your destiny and you will produce holy seed and I need that holy seed that's what this is this is my conversation with God no you're gonna marry him you will have three daughters and I need that holy seed in the earth so you go tell him yes because he wanted six kids and I had told him no and I went God said go yep she said go do a deal with him he actually did he said he loves you so much and will always love you so you go do a deal with him and you tell him you'll have three [Laughter] doesn't it sound like a divine thing you go tell him you're gonna marry me buddy but you'll only have three and they're gonna be spread apart and and there was one more thing you said to tell him and he'll always buy me disposable diapers because I had changed diapers on twelve of my siblings coming up cloth diapers hanging him on the line in Florida where I got it would rain every 15 minutes they would get mildewed you'd have to take them down like eight clotheslines I'm talking about eight clothes on take them down stick them in a wringer washer and right when they go through the wringer my brothers are still a bug on there I had seven brothers there's almost nothing you can say that it's going to bother me okay and I had seven sisters does a lot of drama he made sure I was dead before I left home so I said yes and we got married and I I was madly in love with him I mean I want to encourage everybody here if you've never married don't marry do not marry somebody you can live with marry someone you cannot live without the more modest air the more love you have each other the greater chance you have of it surviving but now that you know about loosing from your soul if when have you upset each other home in the bathroom and loose it all from your soul you'll come out happy as can be or the garage would be a good place or outside it doesn't matter oh yeah the fishing hole yeah that's his favorite place you know I cannot stand fish if you don't know me I cannot stand I mean I'm I hate lists as Satan and fish Satan and fish and broccolis number three that's it and he gave me a fisherman it's actually his gift you know we have a gift that gift we'll use in heaven whether it's a baker or you're gonna rodeos or a designer the passion the gift he made you and sent you here as you never got to use it the minute you step into heaven your whole mansion is designed around that if you're designed to be a dancer you'll have a hole what do you call that pleasure you go to watch a theater like a big theater as part of your mansion you'll have Studios to teach dance you have theaters to to show the dancers and do the dances if you're a musician the same thing you have a concert hall as part of your mansion every beautiful mansion but your whole property if you're gonna have rodeos you'll have hundreds and thousands of horses that have learned to buck really well or the bowls you will never you will never win with those bowls because they'll be yelling you the whole time you are not staying on me that isn't gonna happen you may have been a champion on earth forget it they'll have a massive range so I'll have the whole thing they'll have the whole ring that you have all these things in that's your passion if you mean the best barbecue in your city you'll have a restaurant and serve the best barbecue in heaven it's what you've always wanted to do it is you well yes is a fisherman oh the hunters oh you can still hunt in heaven but you do it with like a scope it's a camera scope looks like a gun but it's just a camera and the way you capture something is on the image the image if you can see them in the mountain of spices you'll go backpacking up there on your horses the horses are laughing at you the whole time because they know you're never gonna find the creatures that you're hunting and the creatures if they capture you first with the scope you go back to their club and there's a massive screen like 30 feet 30 feet 30 feet and there will be your picture and then the car will be the creature that captured you [Applause] so nobody guys but it becomes very intense extremely and rarely has a human being ever captured these creatures and so they're determined I'm gonna be the first one and they go well I think I got some I'm pretty sure I got some yeah then you show up and there's your picture plastered all over the big train heaven is exciting amen so I hope you've grown and you've learned and you said yes if you do those three things then you will live on earth that's they live in heaven but it is a lifestyle and the more you send the army it doesn't have to be just for you it can be for family members friends missionary groups and if you hear something going on if there's a war in another country you literally can send your army to pull down the darkness controlling that whole army and if you get people to come together we know people who come together once a week and strategically send their armies together it's devastating it's devastating the hell's planes amen the more you sound the more you get they get multiplied like you don't get another hundred if you've been sending them for a whole week you'll get 10,000 then it goes to a million and I've been doing it probably around five years or so I have 33 billion that I send everywhere all the time I do sweeps of host states to expose every every group of human trafficking drug trafficking violence witchcraft whatever it is I send them they do is sweep cuz I'm gonna make Florida a region of light [Applause] Colorado yeah Bessie Denver's ending in the Denver all the time you can even send them into the laws that they're gonna make that you don't want or even after they have been made the hosts can go influence the people who are over those laws or they can expose all the crime that's being done because of those laws and they'll realize we should have never done this you can use it in Congress in your own city government in the state government and I certainly sent them throughout the entire election and the midterm elections end every voting booth to speak to the people in the voting booth they vote for life freedom and justice and they will go and they'll come back quickly so be strategic the more you send the more you get amen and and they know it works and we get things from all over the world the people that are doing this that their lives are never been the same so we're gonna live on Earth as we live in heaven amen so father I bless these people right now and you can you can sit down for a minute we're going to take up an offering if we haven't done it yeah I don't know if you did it before I got here or not okay if you want to be a part of helping to supply heavens plan that's how he has me say it if you want to give to help supply heavens plan for what I'm doing and I go all over the world and I share this to many congregations whole congregations are changing they're learning how to lose stuff from their soul they're learning to ask for grace every day and from the time you ask your life changes if you will ask every morning and we even had these you have a little tent card to say remember to ask for grace I tell people write it on your wall write it on something put it somewhere even if you have to put it in your car and you forgot when you get in your car you ask for that grace I asked for receive grace for this day it's a simple when you get upset or angry especially when you're going into traffic but don't keep anger in you but send the host every time we even send out the mountain to them they had to clear all the roads off all the way from the hotel you were going in and blow on that ice and all that snow and there will be none when we drive up there and they did it they're there to keep you and protect you in all your ways amen so don't forget so if you want to be a part we have a lot of plans that we are doing right now we're adding new products I'm going to be creating new CDs DVDs we're having a lot of that put on mp3 we get that all the time even the books will be downloadable really soon because people in Malaysia pay like 60 or 70 dollars to order one book you don't realize how good you have it here no matter how much we think well things have been raised happy you don't live in a foreign country whereas eight dollars a gallon for gas I know that was ten years ago ten years ago we visited country and it was $8 a gallon yeah we we really have a wonderful country that we live in and I say God Bless America all the time you know god bless it and he will because he loves it he loves every country he loves all the people but those who say yes to him and yes to his will his way those are the ones that he can use to do great things so thank you for giving into the offering oh you've already got her up there there you go and yeah you make if you still have checks my mom does I'm still she's got her a little card and she says I don't know if I want to swipe this or not I went if you want me to pray over it I will mom just so you know it's gonna be okay because if anybody tries to use it you still get that back so you're safer she's 87 well I don't know and then she lost her checks and couldn't find him for a long time so then she started mr. the card I think the angels hid them for my sake because I was all the time going in her room and asking the Holy Spirit okay where are our fruit checks you know where everything that was made that is me that will ever be made you know exactly where this checks out so show me right now and every time I pray that every time he shows me but I don't want to do it every week so thank you for giving I'm gonna just bless the offering father God I thank you for the supply coming in father that when we are faithful to give ourselves and and faithful to help ourselves that we will be abundantly overwhelmingly blessed God and I thank you for multiplying it back to everybody a hundred or a thousand fold return God's and I ask it to be multiplied even in the baskets even when it's in our accounts to let it be multiplied because this is your will it's your way and it's your plan amen and I say yes all the time so thank you for saying yes thank you for blessing and may the host go with you everywhere you go don't forget to send them against darkness every day of your life don't forget to ask for grace and don't keep anything in you that you don't want so let's stand up it'll be the last thing we do we're gonna have a soul checkup right now we're gonna get it done it's like anything else you have to choose with your will to do this and we know people I tried it didn't work I said you didn't really mean it they're wanting to be free from cigarettes and you can be we've had a lot of people be free from that but they still wanted them and they still smoked them and what well you know if you want to give it up you're actually supposed to say no if that comes back to you and the enemy will try you you just say no and so I said well I'm still not sure about that but we've had a lot of people set free from all kinds of things like we talked about including homosexuality which is not of God it's the devil perverting the image of God because we are made in His image everyone in Genesis 1:26 was the everyone God ever made we were made in His image and after his likeness so anything that doesn't line up with that is something that Satan got into he wants to destroy images he wants to destroy destinies and I pray they actually call me they call me and ask me how to be free and they go even though I say this is okay I'm talking about the homosexuals even though I will tell people I love this and I'm doing great they're not they said I suffer inside my soul fights with me all the time I don't know why it fights and when it because God put things in you before he sent you and it's not agreeing with what you're choosing and they said well no I mean I really want to go to heaven cuz even though I say this is OK inside I know it's not OK so no matter what they say they know deep inside it's not it's not right and so I just take him through the word about showing them about the image of God and and how he lived in God and what his plans are for us and they get saved they pray and they get saved and then they loosen because then it never they don't feel like that anymore amen so we're gonna choose to lose all kinds of things from our soul and then when we're done with that we will bind the things of God to our soul and you can say you had a soul checkup but you can actually teach other people how to do soul checkups especially people you know that are broken are really sad they're in fear they need to loose that from their self almost everything being displayed from people 99percent of the time it is what is in their soul as you think it's in your soul so are you so people are angry all the time or they're in fear they feel unworthy unworthiness you know they could have a spirit of infirmity you can even lose them from your soul and they'll be gone so we're gonna say I choose as an act to my will and a child of God I lose for my soul all fear all anger all unworthiness all oppression depression despair and grease and hate every harsh critical mean spiteful judgmental word spoken to me or that I spoke I lose it from my soul I lose from myself Oh Oh poverty all wrong handling of money I lose it from my soul I lose from my soul all strife all violence all acts of violence any violence done to me any violence I saw Oh drama of any kind no matter how long ago I lose all abuse from my soul I loose from myself all addictions whether drugs pornography abuse hate food any sickness disease spirit of infirmity I loose it from my soul and he curses spoken over me and he lies told about me I lose our rejection I loose all of I lose all I'm time north of hers now yeah I lose all abandonment I lose all harm or fear of harm I lose all confusion of any kind I lose every word sounds image frequency thought movie or action that represents hell I loose it from my soul in Jesus name Amen I forgot something you can say that yourself you can say it yourself if I didn't mention something say it yourself you can do it all day every day and now we're gonna bind things of God I choose with my will to bind to my soul these are gonna come in waves the love of God the life of God the presence of God the celebration of God the will of God the joy of the Lord his creation his expectation his goodness I bind those things to my soul I bind his welt i bind divine help i bind prosperity I bind his power to my soul yeah I bind his laughter I bind his dance I find his song I bind them to my soul so my soul now prospers amen Hey I am happy I am happy you are so full of God right now if you did that every day of your life what would happen you would be walking on air that's when the greater works if you weren't here the other day I talked about how that actually just happened to me in Reno of all places and Reno I just stepped off of the stuff and didn't realize it and I literally walk down there about this far off the ground my sisters like freaking out behind me no Mike I'm what I'm like I look Turnham like I was standing on air and so I say to the father Wow father is that as good as walking on water and he goes no it's a greater work water you can feel the air you can't feel he said you better get used to that because you'll be doing it it's a manifested daughter of God amen if you see the rainbow coming out of your head that's the image of God if your eyes become flames of fire that's the Lord's image and the father's image if you have gemstones appear on your skin which might sound weird you but everybody in heaven wears them on them they come from the Father they come from his heart he has them all so it's one of his images gemstones in heaven are so extremely valuable because they all come from the heart of God they're put on your robes of righteousness there in your walkways up to you of your home I was in someone's home and I saw massive gemstones which was what they were they had on the on their table as decorations decor for this table that probably seated like I don't know I've been in homes a hundred people the dining room I'm talking about in someone's home but I've been in one even bigger than that this one had about baby 460 people and the drapes on the windows were so sheer they were moving they were living and they had pearls this big on the end of all the drapes their chandelier was 50 feet long in their dining room and it was real gemstones all from the heart of God and their glory was reflected because all over the ground reflects the glory the sky has the glory the buildings are filled with the glory of God if you walk and live in the glory of God you live you live in the glory down here we are practicing because up there it will be your life you come in your mansion and the mansion will speak to you and say welcome home even your mansion knows you knows your name the disciples will come and greet you they'll come and move in for a while King David will come and take you in his own chariot across the skies of heaven on a tour of heaven you go see Paul who sits in this garden all the time and all you're talking about is the epistles but when he gives the epistles he's given what happened in the spirit realm your HOH testimony changes because you get to go in your own little theater you see your life relived with you angelic around you what was going on with Holy Spirit around you you see the whole spirit realm exposed in your life from the time you're growing up and your whole testimony chi changes it changes you'll change there's no sin in any of these videos you'll invite all your friends and family to come and watch your life and they'll laugh a lot because what they did keep recorded was all the silly funny things you did especially when you were teenagers and your parents will be there laughing they'll look the same age as you but then you will go to theirs and you can see all the silly crazy things they did that they wouldn't want anyone to know about and people will go in they laugh and laugh and yes you cry in heaven he wipes away the tears at the end of the Bible when the former things will be remembered no more you laugh let you laugh and cry from joy you laugh and cry because you're so undone about the love of God His goodness the beautiful amazing things he gave you what happens all over heaven you have excitement you have adventure you have joy joy joy you create and invent amazing things everyone in heaven loves you everything in heaven loves you when people go it's heaven on earth they must be living heaven culture amen so thank you for letting me share and then may heaven they heaven invasion will create a habitation for heaven in your home and they will come and not leave and made the hosts go with you [Applause]

operate your freedom in our own personal lives and our country especially in America it is time for freedom for the body of Christ it is time for freedom it's the time to rule and freedom amen because we all know that the truth will make us [Music] free indeed and that's really what time it is in our lives and especially all those who came here tonight you will leave with a deposit of heavens freedom in you amen and my notebook is blank it's here to hang on to I guess I tell people if you're gonna talk about having an you've been there you don't need notes because you will never forget it never if you had a dream so vivid ten years later you remember if it was in heaven then you probably were there a lot of people don't know you're taking even in your sleep your spirit man can be taken in your sleep and that dream is so vivid you recount everything about it what it felt like the music the aromas the experience of just touching heavens ground being in the throne room a lot of places in heaven and heaven is coming and invading this earth you know the body will pick up and hear something from heaven and they'll say that for years and then it actually happens and so this is the time for it to happen heaven is converging with this earth that means a lot will change in our lives that means we need to start living on earth like they live in heaven that's called heaven culture heaven has their own culture trust me every when you move there they know that their life is radically different and their existing to live down here we have to kind of exist sometimes except in this time we actually can live in the past you know you have to take have a living in your life in order to exist you had to make a living right but in this time it's time to exist to live if we can live on this earth like they do in heaven and heaven is invading this earth and are all of our senses are being brought alive moving into manifest and I'm sitting there and God says there'll be manifestation and demonstration there'll be signs and wonders you know there's all kinds of things that they're saying about this time on the earth and we should all be able to experience them and actually help make them happen you know when Christ was here he was a living example for the disciples he was training them the whole time he walked in his life those last three years of his life everything you did or said that was training for the disciples well I come to Train I'm not here to give you a nice word I'm not here to give a nice message that might tickle you a little bit I'm here to change you to Revelation manifestation demonstration signs and wonders and I know some of that will come from heaven itself but really it's because heaven is invading us it's us we it is our turn right now to manifest for heaven in this earth you know we're putting on the show say we're putting on a show and the show has begun we are the third show the first one was the father the second one was Christ in hell on the third day well we are the third show being put on in this earth amen he's going to show up and show off in us that is a show so if you had if you had a lot of showman in you you're ready you are so ready a lot of the body has to be transitioned into being a very open person expressive person doesn't matter what anyone says or you know sees about them God isn't hiding us anymore he's not hiding us time for the body of Christ to come out of the closet and let the world see us operating on the stoats just like they do in heaven we're supposed to manifest the image of the Living God and if you're ready for that you should be saying to the father I want to look like you and act like you and singing to his son I want to look like you and act like you and even the Holy Spirit I want to look like you and act like you we will fulfill Genesis 1:26 what God said let us make man in our image there you go look like them and operate like them their likeness is how they operate that's revelation on that scripture people think why are they saying the same thing twice they're not when you begin to understand heavens language they can say something to something similar to the next word but those are always going to be two different things their image and their likeness are two different things their likeness is literally how they operate so worse was the operating on this earth on this earth like they are in heaven that means you may have a manifestation manifestation is something supernatural that people haven't seen before coming from you I have already had four manifestations knew never done before coming from me as demonstration of the Living God just because I started telling him I want to look just like you so they've seen the rainbow moving in and out of my head say God as the father's image isn't it they've seen that they've seen my eyes become flames of fire amen like my pupils are flames of fire and this was just in the last few months this has started happening and the third thing is that I was just in my products table like saying hi to people and the father had warned me at any time because they gave permission I want you all to say this I give permission anytime anywhere you want to you may demonstrate through me and I yes you need to mean that when you say that father anytime anywhere you choose I give you permission to demonstrate through me who you are and Jesus Christ I give you permission Holy Spirit I give you permission to demonstrate and manifest through me your image and the way you operate so be it I receive it amen I'm gonna take a minute and remind you of some of the things some of the images that Christ took on this earth his eyes were flames of fire he walked on water he made food created food amen he traveled in the spirit realm and controlled time because it's Ellery them they stepped in the boat they were there that's one of the things that he did is one of the ways he operated he raised the dead even after they were stinking he terrified the demonic all the time amen he walked on water are you willing to do that the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit one of his images is littered becoming a flame of fire it was a flame of fire that couldn't be quenched couldn't put out he showed up in the upper room and boy did he have drama drama comes with him he is called the drama king in heaven just wait and see what's going to happen he was invisible everybody say one of the ways he operated yet he had many things that represented him in his image that he used in this earth a man and the father the living rainbow moving in and out of him it's not just a rainbow it's alive moves in and out like this in waves all the time in heaven in and out of him that's who John saw in the book of Revelation in chapter 4 he saw him sitting on the throne with a rainbow like unto an emerald you notice he didn't say just like an emerald because he didn't have a word for teal teal is the father's favorite color and those bands coming out of him can be like that can be one full band that goes from him to the walls of the throne room it could be like red or blue or blue green teal it could be purple it can be blue and a red mixed together whenever those rainbow that rainbow comes out of him when you're in the throne room you could have been there seven different times and that rainbow was a different color every time everyone in this in the throne room would turn that color it would saturate them and turn them that color say that's the father's image there are cosmic waves I call cosmic waves like I think to me the biggest greatest thing is like cosmic it's bigger than all the cosmos out there he has waves to come through from him love I'm telling you the greatest love come from him and then the glory when the glory comes you hear it has a frequency the love and and the glory of God and the peace of God they have a frequency that comes with him and I've been in there before one like this wave like continue like a shock wave would come from him and it would go like mmm mmm I can't even make the sound it was so loud and it would penetrate everybody in there all the way around him and they would get they would get thrown to the floor that's that's one of the ways he operates it is he also has flames of fire his flames the fire are blue his pupils are literally flames of fire and the glory comes something so great if you stand in front of him long enough you'll see these flames of fire that are his eyes it's one of his images so all these amazing images are these images in the way they operate from the father from his son from the holy spirit he is a whirlwind I've seen him come in many times as a whirlwind sometimes he was a whirlwind of the rainbow and he come and he he would be like you know kind of invisible but he's actually big he's actually got a body arms legs a head or you wouldn't have one they all do the Father the Son Holy Spirit all have an actual body because we're made in there or you wouldn't have on those images are manifested in different ways and of course the Holy Spirit also in the image of a dove that was not just a little dove with feathers that Dove had feathers what were made out of flames the fire when he came down and was over Christ when John was going to baptize him remember when he baptized him and that dove came down and then they heard the voice of the Father declaring who his son was and he was pleased in him and so they have a voice there's another thing about their voice haven't experienced that yet I've heard it when it talks in the Bible that it was sounded like many thunders or many waters because they didn't have like today's language to interpret that he has his voice is layered there's layers in his voice that's why it sounds like many many thunders or many waters he literally has layers in his voice expect that to happen to you one day when you get up to speak and people are shook they're just shook to the core when the hearing speaking is like layered like many saying it instead of one this is his this is one of the images this is this is one of the images that they and the likeness that they operate in so if we're supposed to be just like them you better be ready for any of these things to manifest to you okay just the works of Christ was shocking to people but the greater works then he is reserved for this time there's time again this is a different time if you've never heard that said you're not living in the same spiritual time that we did even a few years ago because I've been talking about this for a lot of years a lot of many years I've been talking about all this happening and you know but God has on this timeline a time when that starts and we're not waiting on that time anymore we are in that time we're in that time where we will stand out and stand up and show off you can you stayed up and you can you know you need to wake up and stand up and that's nice but standing out and showing off is a whole different thing that's when you can't hide and you'll never be able to hide again because God has marked you for greatness if you're alive in this time even those who don't know him you know some of them are marked for greatness and so we need to believe and have faith and hope for everybody no matter how wicked they are God right now in this time is moving on the hearts of very wicked people he really is and you may not see Christ coming from them at the time but you'll see a major change in the way that they talk and they live like the North Korean president if people don't realize there is a major change in that man that didn't just happen for any reason that was God's plan he had a plan I'll either change him or remove him off the face of the earth and many leaders and countries right now are in that place because God is trying to align as many countries as he can to agree with his plan and those countries will prosper beyond measure because they've heard him and they are shifting God is right now shifting she's shifting governments to shape that nation Korea is going to be shaped by God by God as America is right now we're being shifted right now do you haven't noticed in the shifting process all of Hell will be exposed people no matter how high up the ladder they have gotten if they're a wicked if they have a wicked agenda and they've been hiding it it will be exposed and those who are in leadership or in our government or even in big business this includes big business - it even includes the church those who are hiding lying sinning and thinking that they could stand here and give the Word of God and speak on his behalf if they think they can do that anymore not in this time they will not and the Spirit of God is really moving on the hearts of those that are doing it so they don't die I'm just as serious about that is all the rest because there this is a time that's so important to God that he's removing all the roadblocks he's removing all of the weights anything that has held us back to be able to prosper to have a voice to have a platform everywhere to speak on his behalf whether is the business arena the governmental arena arts and entertainment arena news and media arena he's moving on the hearts of people and he is shifting even in those different arenas you're gonna see major changes in all of those arenas when God's gonna do something new he always sends a a messenger or messengers and they have revelation in them the messenger if it's about heaven or time or God they have to have revelation in them that's not something that came from their own mind never in my life did I set a time thinking I was gonna do any of this I had my plan me Father Son and Holy Spirit and a nice little you know executive apartment somewhere moving and shaking the business world that was my plan so what does he do remove me totally completely out of the business world well that took that off his plan off my plan my plan that was gone it was just gonna be me did you get that me not a husband not children me father said in Holy Spirit well that was wiped off you know that was quite tough of my plan I obviously got married I I have three beautiful children that God said they were holy seed and he informed me because a long time ago I gave him my life he informed me you are marrying him he did not ask me when you get the place what God is telling you that is significant because you're not going to fight against your gonna say okay yeah I gave you a permission which you did tonight and he started a 40-year plan on me to prepare me for what he was gonna do with me he even took me out of my wonderful job I had there was high paying and I loved it so I thought well you know I'm married but I can still work in the business world and I loved it I've worked over 25 years in the business world well he wiped that off from my plan by getting me fired he's gonna make sure I left but he was kind enough to tell me 30 days before it happened in 30 days you will not be working there anymore I was working in a law at a nice job with a Christian lawyer which was a miracle Oh a Christian comedian lawyer which was a double miracle so I had a lot of fun I love my job enjoyed it didn't know a thing about law but was trained in business law estate and probate and tax law and real estate which I didn't know a thing about it and he still hired me that's called favor that's also called God's plan so he really did he got me and shifted me everywhere and then I had my three daughters that was a big surprise but he also told me that you're gonna marry him you'll have a three girls and I need them all so you will say yes to him because I would say nope see one at six and I am one of 15 at the not the very top if you've never been part of a big family especially one of the older ones you don't know what dying is you die every day so I hope to raise 12 of my siblings and now he's telling me remember my plan no husband no children just the Trinity and me doing big business together and he informed me each of these times because from the time I was young I could hear him well but the more I gave myself to him and the more I chose his will his way and obey I will tell you right now a very important keys right his will his way not yours a lot of people on his will they do it their way it takes longer it'll slow things down you may have to start all over again sometimes so I decided I'm doing it I'm gonna have I want your will your way and then I had to obey even when it didn't make sense and I promise you he is almost never going to make sense one of my friends recently made a statement she she preaches a lot her family have like seven churches everywhere and she's blocked so she's got a lot of layers in her soul she's extremely expressed that she's a lot of fun but she will tell you the way it is let me tell you she said God always ask you to do things crazy things he lets you do crazy things that don't make any sense to you but yes for the crazy things so that it can bring the supernatural what usually doesn't make any sense either and I promise you she was right on when she said that it's almost always crazy doesn't make any sense because he is not a man he has his own plan right so here is after saying all that in all these years he then began to tell me okay right now you're marrying him you're gonna have three girls you can have them five years apart if you want to but you're gonna have them and then as a baby he showed me the destiny of each one of them I saw what they would be doing I know what they'll be doing for a very long time in their in their life need some water I'll talk to nothing comes out I don't want to waste time so Jesus as one of the way he operates he wasn't that bombed by time even as a righteous man and I like to remind everybody yes he was the son of God but he walked and lived as a righteous man just like you he had to face everything you faced he had to make decisions how he was gonna respond react what he was gonna allow in his soul but he wouldn't allow in his soul that he would love instead of hate he didn't sin he didn't sin he said no to sin he had absolute authority and power over all the power of the enemy that's why he could give it to us he would command the heavens to open did you hear me say the word command say a righteous man commanded the heavens to open and he did that more than once are we righteous can we command did he command the hosts of heaven that's another way he operated the hosts of heaven are the armies of heaven and he even said when he was on trial if I wanted to I could call the army of heaven to come and fight on my behalf did he say that say as a righteous man he said that he commanded when he was on this earth he commanded the water to turn into wine and that was not normal wine he commanded the water to turn into heavens wine when that be great for some people he did that all the time because it reminded him of home heavens wine is the best wine and that's why they said at the wedding you have saved the best for last never have we ever had wine like this before never yeah because it didn't come from Earth it came from heaven and have news for you Jesus did that at home all the time that's why Mary knew he could do it right she knew that he could turn that water into heavens wine he did it when he was growing up nobody was ever sick in his home while he was there the food would all be always be multiplied on the table he already operated in these things and he knew one day he would step out and do them remember what Mary said go do whatever he says to do and Jesus said are you making me step up before my time no Mary knew it was time and when they came for him remember when he's preaching somewhere and they said your mother and your siblings are outside asking for you they were not asking him to come home and preach say Amen or he would have been they would have already been in the meetings they missed heavens wine they missed the food be multiplied they missed never been sick because of his presence these are things he had to learn and grow when he grew up in these but there came a time in his life when he knew exactly who he was he knew his purpose from the earth he had to say yes like we had to say yes he had to choose to do these things you have to choose to be chosen many are called but few are chosen because they don't say yes to being chosen that's why I always say say I'll receive it because when you say I received it that means you're saying yes I want to be chosen I had to choose even though he was telling me what to do I still had to choose to do I had to obey and the Bible says those who are willing and she'll eat the fatter the it's a promise in this time it's really important to make sure that you obey even if it doesn't make sense and so I told you there were four things he started manifesting in me the fourth thing the fourth thing happened last weekend when I was in Reno Reno Nevada I walked on air remember how they operate Jesus walked on water I walked on the air and I was quite shocked and my sister was behind me we were going to the greenroom the pastor was in front of me to head into the green room and I didn't know that there was a drop a step this big come to in something there's a big step and then you've stepped down I didn't see the step I just was going because he was beacon to me as he was going forward I'm speaking to him while he's walking we're both talking to each other and I stepped off to step into nothing and it felt like nothing if you stepped in water you would at least feel the water so I stepped off and I kept going and then I stepped off with my other foot and I'm there and I'm your sister like gas behind me and and now we're so shocked when I look down on this far off the floor in the air this is what is going to happen to you and if you remember even as even at the very end of G's Minh when everything was done and he was going to go home remember he just went up in the air Jesus just went up in the air didn't he say he walked down there right before mine home so I'm just standing there and I'm I said to the father this is Myall and when is this sort of I actually in my mind was speaking him and he was answering me my mind and went is this like walking on water he goes oh no this is better he said when Peter stepped out of the boat he could feel the water you aren't feeling anything and he said by the way you better get used to this like whatever you want and so my sister's like yeah I'm standing on the urine aperture on look at her wonder Stan yeah yeah in her face is like and I actually dropped my iPad I was so so startled and at this point the passage around he goes what's going on and the mini said that my feet just on the floor and I'm like that didn't bother me at all and Django you know said why don't you just say I was walking on it that sounds a little bit better than flow I guess it always both okay that was say a manifestation of the power of God so all for these things that have just started happening is because I gave him permission I gave him permission now he didn't warn me and say oh in the minute you're gonna just step on you're gonna walk on there he didn't warn me about any of these he didn't say oh by the way rainbow is gonna start coming out of your head moving in and out of your head and and I've actually had a few people together that saw another person he was visiting and they were just talking to me and I'm in the middle of this kitchen and they keep going like this like the tryna mommy and I'm like what's wrong he goes you have a rainbow that's like coming in and out of your hat she tried to look to see if it was the lights or was 7 reflecting and I'm he goes no it's the rainbow about an hour later he goes there's that rainbow again I just totally ignored I ignored him you know I thought well I don't know what he ate for dinner but maybe he's tired and then the next weekend I went to a church and was speaking and one thing God the Father told me personally Jesus and the father both told me that at one point everybody in the meeting would see the angels that are with me because we're going to see heaven say we're going to see heaven lots of heaven you come in one day and see all the angels waiting you see yours that came with you okay and if any I'm coming to do something for heaven Oh God then you'll see them too in your mind you have to stop thinking that you're normal we are not like all the people on the earth don't have Jesus their DNA has not been changed but yours has and the other thing too you better get ready for as you actually do have power yourself people oh that sounds just too oh no you have power yet power because Jesus said we did he actually gave it to us all these are in the Word of God okay you just maybe didn't know that you were born in the right time the time that you're born in is very strategic for God and he will wait to a certain event happens when an event happens a fullness of time has come and when a bonus of timing has come that means things will be different in the earth that's also scriptural a fullness of time has come that means the old stuff isn't going to be like totally gone away but the way we operate will be greater and more powerful than the way we used to operate in the old time and when when John the Baptist made that announcement that certainly a fullness of time had come amen upon the time came when Christ was born in the earth another fullness of time came when he was going to step up into his ministry was crucified on the cross that was another time because things would change things change when Christ was born and things changed when he stepped into his ministry and things changed when he was crucified on the cross and was rose from the dead major changes were made this is the time this is the time for the body the manifested say manifested sons and daughters to stand up and manifest in this earth say the earth is crying out and it's shaking in travail for us to stand up and speak to the earth speak to the air speak to the hosts for the impossible to happen amen the earth is not shaking because it is the end and everything is going to be all over the people who don't know God's timing say it is and all the people in the church who don't know this is sitting on the rapture rugs because they want to escape because it's so awful well they will be sitting there forever these are some of the greatest times on the earth that God has written down and he's not going to ignore them but he expects us to participate not escape participate don't escape there's another t-shirt and so many of the body think is so horrible and awful they can't even when you get stuck in that place you can't see the good that is happening you have filled your soul your own soul with doom and gloom wrath and destruction and you can't even see or understand this is the day of his power not the day of his wrath those are two different times we're in the last days because we're a lot closer than we were thousands of years ago we're in the last days but not the last day and major things will happen a lot of things have to happen before the end of time comes many many many things we'll be seeing it doing it experiencing it but we aren't going to escape it you either you either feel it and watch it and sit on the sidelines or you'll be in it I'm going to be in it amen so America right now is in it America hasn't been brushed to the side by god it's a baby nation it's one of the it's one of the youngest nations in the earth I mean there's I've recently visited nations that were thousands of years old I've been to them recently and I come back here and there's no place like here maybe Israel Israel was powerful is a beautiful place filled with the Spirit of God millions of angels are in Israel they still stand in the place where Christ knelt in the garden had to drink that cup they're still in the upper room and I already seen the fiery open we're opening in the upper room where the Holy Spirit came in and anointed all them and the Holy Ghost they're still there they're there even over Paul's where he was held in prison is an open stairway from heaven he created an open heaven in the prison it's powerful to see the things that remain that we're done by those in the past that love God obey God and we're going to make a lot of those places right now in this earth amen so this is this is the time to walk in liberty freedom right and justice and I recently in Reno we all know that Kavanaugh I'm very political right now I'm doing heavens politics executing God God's government on the earth so if we have a government on the earth from heaven that we have to execute for him that's politics so you're not going to escape politics don't ignore it make sure you vote for justice and righteousness right and life and God needs this nation free of the devil which means it's gonna be good for everybody here God is not gonna be a parser to who's living here they will enjoy all the Freedom and the Liberty to prosper you know to live in health to have new creations and inventions never seen before in this country they'll enjoy all the stuff that will be created in these 24 years of God in the White House you've never heard that that is not news to me and God has hand-picked the person he wants there and there's no human being on this earth there's nothing in the Earth's over there's nothing that can take those people from that white house [Applause] amen hey man I hope everybody's happy about that that God would pick remember he's strange he doesn't think like a man he picked the most on likely never in the history of our country has one man caused such an uproar never in the history of our nation or even in this world except Christ because Christ caused the greatest uproar and his time he was not liked by the hierarchy he was hated by the ruling powers and the devil especially despised him and tried every way he could to get him out of the picture just have something here you never hear any of this coming against someone who isn't gonna do good did you notice that the ones you don't care about the country don't even know what they're doing that might not have been their plan but they just weren't the right person amen and that means in any country it says when when the righteous are in leadership when they're in charge the people will they will rejoice and God does love everybody but just like he chose John the Baptist for something Moses or something Abraham for something Jacob Isaac it didn't go all the way down the line David Solomon he hand-picked them before they were here he still does that and it's usually if you look at King David he smelled like the Sheep he danced and sang in the meadows you would not have picked him to be king even the Prophet was amazed the ones who look tough strong handsome those were the ones he wanted to and God said no no no no yeah and what about Gideon he here all the time from God he actually told God no no no no no I must have the wrong person nope I'm not doing this no no that is not me I am NOT doing it but God kicked him did he do it you have to be the same way because you know what I wouldn't pick me and apparently neither would a lot of pastors they don't know what they're missing for one reason they don't like the pink here this is the absolute truth yeah God would not do that that's our answer when you know I love you but you don't know him you might put color on your hair in the middle of the night as you're walking across a platform to speak turn it green then they run wait for it [Applause] one change something so insignificant because image is important your image inside is always more important than that outside and the thing is I've known a lot of these pastors for 40 years helped in all their projects my dad that we would my family go help in all their projects to help the poor the sick paint their churches up to bring them food and they were blessed beyond measure about how godly and awesome we were until I fell off the deep man and put pink in my hair you choose they choose a man I will tell you this their wives coming to my meetings and the other thing they say is well I love what you do but our congregation is not ready and when will I see them at the meetings they show up I've got a pastor something those church I'm so glad and love with Revelation so you have to choose through your whole life you have to choose things and I am glad he chose me and I actually like the pink hair now it's not going away because in this time we're gonna be strange just like him we will be different speak different live differently and it will cause people to come and ask you why amen I need a tissue oh yeah if I if I if I cry during the worship it's gonna be over any man yeah Jesus makes me cry a lot the love he has for us and he he looks beyond our mistakes and the thing is people wanted to throw mistakes in with sin and they'll tell you have to repent you may have made a mistake but you apologize for mistakes you don't repent for mistakes you repent for sin I'm having to teach that to some people there's a difference Amen I mean you know I've had people say all kinds of things like well you lied because you said you would come by and you didn't I said that's I forgot that's not lying lying is saying something that's not the true and so they're gonna get a lesson if they say things like that to me and what no I love you very much but you know when you've got 15 phone calls and people showing up you gotta make decisions for things around the world you probably forget some time I said but that's not lying okay so I apologized so don't let people make you feel like you have sinned because you made a mistake amen okay making mistakes in this world is gonna happen sometime right if I got to send a letter to somebody you know the simplest things but most people who bash you by the way they don't have a vision of their own the father showed me this a long time a lot of the bastards out there that bash you online or whatever they don't have their own vision so people who do they will bash you this is truth that's why they can get so mean they have nothing in their own life just keeping them focused and their going forward something they have nothing to do and they don't want to do anything they look around to see who they can pick on let them go just let it go and you keep running your race amen because you know the enemy will try anything you can to get you sad offended wounded fearful that will crush you keep you back take you off the track and so if you can't get you to abandon Christ or just say I'm giving up completely he'll do whatever he can to delay you or distract you so don't let it happen just say well I'm not gonna let that it's not touching me I'm not letting it penetrate me you notice Christ walks like that in this earth amen so in this time we will do things to manifest them and demonstrate for them and it won't necessarily be in a small crowd so get ready to go to Walmart and you're walking in the air while you're pushing your cart down here down the aisle you know how if you're walking your the carts down here see how many people come to you say what is up with you I am manifesting the Living God that sound exciting he's given us a whole new way and new weapons and demonstrating and manifesting is one of those weapons because you are terrifying the enemy every time you do something like that he'll is afraid right now and they and you know what they're not really good at hiding that whatever rises up and they're afraid but they will bash it bash it lies you know and misjudgment and everything fails they'll do it on purpose to make people think that person is nothing they're not worth something they have no value whatsoever or they're not living the right kind of line and they're not going to jack the wicked any men but hell hell is going to find out that heaven is going to expose a lot of that amen so we'll know who carries truth who lives the truth so we can trust them amen is a powerful time time for freedom everybody say time for freedom that means your lies you'd be different your children will be raised differently in this time we have the right and the freedom to command heavens army to push back the darkness and crush their plans right to raise the dead that we're cremated stop earthquakes and make it go back the way it was before it happened oh stop the storms and not just the Hurricanes and you know that has been so powerful to work with people over the last several months God started the weather warriors I didn't and he put one more thing on my plate get down there and tell people how to take authority over those storms in this time in the earth you're not supposed to have destructive weather say I receive it Jesus didn't tolerate the storm and that was not the only one he stopped it wasn't the only one he stopped you do realize the Bible is sort of like a basic outline because the Bible says itself if everything in all the works that Christ did were written down the books would go around the world so how much do you not know about he didn't just raise the people from the dead you read about in that Bible it was an example okay well while we raised someone from the dead they were dead for four days Wow way to spend thirty days and you're your family members ashes have been sitting on the Shelf in the closet the mantle and you go oh well we forgot to have their celebration service so you're bringing a little ashes and set it there you better be ready for this one and Jesus says to you and you hear him get everything laying hands on that John come in the ashes come in their life in their spirit to come back into that body and it burst open and there is a whirlwind of ashes right here in wherever they're having the acceleration there's gonna be a celebration and those ashes go out places they stopped and there's the person I tell you they'll be miraculous miraculous conversions and salvations in the celebration when they go in Jesus name I command that spirit of the whatever tobe white to come back into his body and that earned burst and that whirlwind of ashes come up say he can put the ashes back together even if they sprinkled him on the ocean he knows where every molecule of our body is and he can bring it all back together say that is a greater work I've seen many of the greater works and their greater or he would not have said they were greater right so you know it be praised against uh they pray against the storms and everything and your prayers probably made a difference but when you command Christ commanded the storm to stop he stopped the winds and he calmed the waves amen so we do greater works so we stop earthquakes who make it put it back say Amen well you believe it or not it's gonna happen this is the thing if he ever wants you to do something like that you will hear him you're not going to sit down and make a list I'm gonna go do this on this day those type of things he will say it to you and you will hear him and he showed me that happening in the earth I was taken forward and I saw what happening I saw a young person in California they've been a massive earthquake buildings crumbled everywhere hundreds of people died in this earthquake and they ran out in the street and they said stop and then they said put it back in Jesus name and the earth began to shift and all the parts of the buildings came up out of the ground and put the building back together the bridges came back together and all the dead were raised and back in the offices or the stores are walking on the street where they were before it happened say greater work we will do them in that powerful Jesus said all the works I did you will do and even greater works you will do we didn't know what the greater works were is those things a plane crashes everybody dies the news media run to record it and show it and the person with the microphones are believer and Jesus says to them bring them all back to a life and they command over that whole thing you will go back the way you were I command every spirit of every person somebody come back into their body and life will be restored now I know I've told you before all the people came back from the dead that were burnt but the plane also came back together like it never happened and because she was the reporter they all saw it all over the world because he's not doing things in secret they will be done openly manifests the way word manifest means to clearly and plainly make known you're living in those days and I'm just giving you a warning a heads-up then it will happen to you sometime in your life it's gonna happen and the mass dead raising the raising of the masses of dead it's going to happen in our lifetime it's going to happen that means if somebody went somewhere some evil harming and the use chemical warfare and the whole entire place was dead you will go in there and speak God's Word whatever God says for you to say you speak and everyone who is dead would be alive whole and well and all the any remnants of that chemicals on the entire city the ground the air the water will be gone in Jesus name people are gonna know and this is his real reason for doing that they will know there is a God and we only do this because of him we can't do this without him but we will do it for him and with him and God's plan is to erase the whole gray area that says there is no God so I know I've seen millions of Muslims running to the kingdom I've been shown millions of homosexuals run into the kingdom and as they ran into the kingdom they got all their body parts back like God made them God does care about them and I can tell you this I'm messing around this some of those people has some of the greatest callings on their life or the devil would not have messed him up and they think you were born that way but God doesn't make anybody that way because that is not his image and we are made in His image there'll be some of the greatest witnesses amen Jesus even appearing before the scene he not the Sanhedrin you know he just said to me I already did that he does have a sense of humor and he's like but here beside me walking with ya I know he's in me but he's also walking with me he'll tell me things to say thing to talk about because he loves this time amen he's been appearing in person to the Taliban even to some of the ISIS like face to face with them someone I know was going around preaching these they preach a lot in the Middle East and they went into this country where they're the the Taliban were actually in this country he's fearless this person is fearless he's done all kinds of certain signs and wonders for God in those countries and then he went in that country and separately I thought if he was going on the sides to be one of us all these Muslims came out to him and the one in the front had a Bible under holding a Bible on their head they were walking to him not with guns now in machine guns not wanting to blow him up which was what most of them I do their walk around with a Bible on his head and they went up and said the 1-cos speaking that's it did you bring Bibles with you you have any Bibles because I've been reading this one to them and they want to know that God they want to know Jesus Christ do you have any Bibles you have Bibles that we can have because of one of them having the Word of God they didn't burn it they didn't throw it away God moved on them to read it and they begin to see a different kind of God then who they worshiped and that whole group got saved that was that was a suddenly the other thing that is for this time are suddenly say suddenly say something will happen overnight and it will change me forever it's called a suddenly [Music] it's called a suddenly because we're in an accelerated time even in our own country here in America so many things have already been shifted and begin to change in a short amount of time over the years we've fought there's been so many jobs lost in this country it wasn't just because of one one leader it's just happened the economy has really gone down and this time it will prosper and flourish like it never has before because of God's plan of our obedience and because Jesus is here taking over ok that there will be one suddenly after another in our economy and and since we now have a righteous man in the Supreme Court and I started talking about Kavanagh and stopped but we will have one suddenly after another in this country because this is God's plan and we're ready for it amen but but in a little bit over just a year or so two million jobs have been created in this country and in my own City I see signs everywhere we are hiring hiring hiring hiring we have so much hiring going on in our city and when I visit places I see those same signs they're hiring because they have money and their business is increasing that means they need more people this is a good time to get into business amen and I like to tell people what Jesus says to me he said I was sawn I was sent into the business arena I was first known in the business arena a carpenter he said my father did not send me as pastor Jesus he didn't he sent him as a business man who could connect with every area and everywhere whatever the arenas were he could connect with him because he was a businessman why was the eating with the sinners people wanna know how come he was sit with sinners because he had business contracts with them he was a master carpenter he had the best home they knew he did really good stuff so he had all kinds of business contracts all the time Heymann had him with the sinners and they liked him business is a good Avenue to take the gospel that's why he's sending me as a business woman I know I have revelation I know talk about the wild things of God he gave me that revelation he gave it to me I never said John said okay I want this this and this I only asked him for love I wanted to love him I asked him for more love I'm gonna be like my earthly father was who was filled with so much of the love of God he literally loved his enemies and had fun doing it i understanding i understand the blessing that curse it's a whole lot more fun to bless people who don't like you it gives the devil a really bad day and it goes into the soul of that person and it makes you happy cuz it's better to give dad my dad lived by that so I give away stuff all the time I had them come home from work there'd be stuff missing he knew I gave it away my dad did that we get I give away food people give me suffer give it away I get money I give it away that's why I have a CFO that takes care of the money I won't be able to go anywhere I'm gonna make any products when I first got products at game all away I gave all my books away I'm gonna bless you here's okay 500 books away marbles where's the books I bless the people she says those were supposed to be sold so we could get more and then you can take some of them and give them away blessed people so from now on those products aren't coming to you they're being shipped to me every what happen on the products table because my dad has such a heart to love and care he didn't care what color you were he didn't care what he didn't even care what your faith was he was gonna love you bless you and feed you he was a good example for me that's why you got to have people that can do the other stuff even in business you can have a visionary the visionary he's so excited and passionate about everything if you don't have something there to help you with your money you're gonna have none unless you have both of those gifts you need someone who could be administrator if you're thinking about going to business make sure you have that other half that you don't have you can have a vision the parks look amazing but if you don't have someone to make sure things are done right or kept like all the licenses and permits are renewed the insurance is being paid you know the taxes are being paid you better have something that can do that keep track of stuff for you okay and keep it multi trillionaire didn't give whole warehouses away if you want to this is also a time for money to be manifested in great amounts to us the wealth of the wicked and then I receive it - I'm gonna receive that and people gonna want oh we know we're getting out of here why did you why'd you tell those people those things we want to leave I want that's not contain ship time you don't know what time he's coming back that's what we have some pins back there magnets as they roll up your rapture rug that's Holy Spirit yells that everywhere he goes roll up your rapture rug that's not what he meant by occupy but that's what I was taught my whole life in church Jesus could come next week you might come tomorrow oh and I don't think you know that I think we should be encouraged to be here stay here do something make a difference and don't buy the c-rations it tastes awful I don't even think the raccoons would eat them people would send us stuff in the mail when I don't think I want this we throw it on the back patio we have a raccoon you know assembly that comes every now and then they picked it up and threw it back down and what we are not eating those okay if the raccoons with Needleman a garbage they are a bitter one I don't want it amen they like doughnuts those raccoons were getting like that fat we finally finally have stopped feeding Emily because when we leave there no one's gonna feed them okay they're not it doesn't say that the Lord will set a table for them you could set a table for us so yeah people come to my house and the raccoons are staring this like last door and they'll go down knock on the doors if you throw something out there like a sub sandwich they'll scrape all the lettuce and tomatoes out not eating that stuff peep out that you're hurting the know we've never had a single one die that have been flourishing bountifully prospering in every way the only issue is we've got something to keep him away from coming over the preserve work next to preserve and the cats we feed out front guess he's meeting the cats yeah they know they're smart they came around the front to get the cats food we have to got them running away away of course they know us so they're like wow you've just moved dinner to the front you go everything moves Pico there make sure the raccoons yeah but there go go away go away they like us that's why I my I actually just redid my whole bio to send out to the pastures now who invite me and I've added to a tormentor of demons apply for a job somewhere to put it on there and see what people say to you it is a great thing I've had 25 years business experience you know and all these people and companies I've worked for and everything and then I say you know and you go on down the little list there you know I've done this done that achieve that wow that whatever and then I go I'm a tormentor of demons I speak to the weather you know and the storm stops and I live with my husband so many years of success with the resident raccoons is a crazy squirrel and some rescue cats that's either going to impress them with nothing to do you I don't I don't have to give up resumes now but that would have been really nice to give that out right be different this is the time for great extreme extravagant favor for the body of Christ like we have never had it before and God told me in America there will be a time when people will be proud that they have you know Christians for their friends the singers will be proud to announce oh why not have a couple Christians that are my friends they go you have Christians what do they talk about do they raise the dead you seen them raise the dad do they have fire coming out of their head because we saw some of that on the internet we want to know do you know any other Christians that might want friends cuz they're not doing that right now but they will it's a time for freedom and I'm also fill this in for free but there will come a time that even the wild animals will be at peace with us in this earth they won't attack they will have no fear of us because we'll have so much of God's presence and our life they will trust us and I'm talking about four generations that will happen and then when the last last days come there's a scripture in the Bible that kind of talks about that but it talks about the beasts of the field will come and attack the people and the people will be shocked because it hasn't happened for generations because of heaven being in this earth and we allow it to be in our lives we operate and and you know in the supernatural with Jesus Christ he lives in you he's gonna operate through you then things are going to be drastically different in this earth if you apply for a job in the government you'll probably be hired immediately because you have Christian on your application this government will be so radically changed and justice will be given like it's supposed to be given and now I'm gonna go back to Cavanaugh for a few minutes when I was watching that where they actually gave the vote remember he won by two votes that was probably by two Democrats that changed their mind some some of them did actually vote for him when they were confronted I think it was that one senator the stood up and said that he was ashamed of all of them he said they're lying and you know you are lying but trying to prove Cavanaugh to be a victor victor to be a perpetrator he said when you say that he is wrong he's committed a crime you're lying and you know that person was paid and she was paid Cavanaugh has been innocent his whole life a strong believer a loving family man even in high school in college so many people who knew him came up they didn't put him on the way to see him but they told the news reporters in anyway you never probably saw that in the news they had so many more people standing with him than against him but they were desperate because nothing else was working so they chose lying and deceiving which is wrong and I'm talking about this is about our justice system this is about telling the truth this whole thing was about telling the truth is that right it wasn't just a position it was about the Supreme Court or they're supposed to you know make sure truth is being done and justice is being given while they weren't given him justice and the father was telling me in heaven he will win that seat and I will make sure he wins that seat I don't care what they try what they say he is absolutely innocent and he himself will have justice in that moment and he said and when he wins the seat he is one to see for heaven on the Supreme Court because he's a believer and he said yes to God we said yes to God you give him permission to operate in you in your household in your business and so when I was watching all this going on God said when they said you know he had one God said this moment I am sending three special ops angels to be with him the whole time he's on the earth the whole time he's in the Supreme Court which will be a long long time he said these angels will keep him from all harm and no one who comes against him will succeed and he said these angels are some of them wants the hosts the army who fought for Israel in the flesh that's why they're special ops special operatives that's how importance is to God he said when he won he won me a seat God said he won me a seat in Supreme Court [Applause] he is serious about justice and at the moment that they said that he had one you know it was fifty two forty eight and it's them they said he had one I heard millions of little babies in heaven celebrating and I heard them shouting now in America freedom will come to all the little babies and what was allowed for us to die will be struck down and the future is gonna be great for the little babies being born in America amen if you think heaven wasn't involved in that they were very involved even the ones living there were involved but especially the little babies and ones that were aborted that live in heaven they were shouting and celebrating they knew what was going on in the earth they knew how important that he won that seat because they will overturn Roe vs. Wade [Applause] thank you Jesus amen heaven is very excited about this time if you have family members living there they are all cheering right now because heaven is shifting our government so they can then shape the future of this nation and people will come to this country to find God amen so this is definitely a time for freedom and everyone will benefit from it even the ones who didn't want it and you can get so far into deception you don't realizing you don't realize because of the heat of the moment and being used by the enemy you cannot even you can't even I'm trying to think I don't not very good with with human words yeah you can't comprehend what you're saying yes to how that would affect your future and they're not realizing that they were damaging the future of their generations coming on the earth and then I will just talk about the agenda because I will and God wants me to the agenda of this Democratic Party now not even before but now has has really regressed into darkness so much because they filled their self with hate and judgment and lies that were given and even the fake news are getting physical I mean mental therapy mental help because they've messed up their own soul as you think it in your soul or your heart that is what you will become so what they spew down all the time that's why they can't let it go they have become the very thing that they gave out to everybody they ate it themselves every time they said it and winning their soul and they don't know how to be healed they don't know how to be made whole families were separated I know people there family members will not talk to them if they voted for Trump they've written him off their list like they never existed because their souls were filled with darkness I know Trump wasn't perfect God knows he wasn't perfect but if we dug far enough back and almost everybody's past we should took every every part of the media let's go back in their past 30 years and see what they were doing how about all those senators how about all those Democrats that were voting against Cavanaugh why don't we go back in their life and see what they did way back when but when we give our lives to God and whether you know it or not Trump has given his heart to Jesus Christ he's given his heart to Jesus Christ I know a lot of leaders who he calls in all the time Deacon consol he stands in the counsel of the godly which is another reason why the Liberals don't like him because they don't want godliness they don't want righteousness they thought it was bad enough that Trump won and they didn't like him but they realized he was giving God a place in the White House and welcoming God in our country they really got terrified thinking it's all over if he stays in there we'll lose everything we've gained over the last twenty thirty years we'll lose it all we need to do something to stop this but they can't they can't and every time they try to do something they desist on heaven they will lose they'll lose in the elections they'll lose in areas of business they lose in areas of the government because this is God's divine time and when you said right before the election I'm turning that map red whether anyone likes it or not I'm putting my hand on America I'm gonna move across it when they wake up in the morning they will find out that map is red was it red well get ready for the midterm elections [Applause] it's gonna turn it red again because this is his plan and it goes from the top down and our president is saying yes to freedom yes to liberty yester prospering yester protecting our country yes to a sound military yes to the rights of the believers being restored right over to in the Johnson amendment they said they couldn't speak from their pulpit about about the but you know about voting his stuff they couldn't have a political platform at all which wasn't fair because every other group could do it it didn't matter what they were they could be Satanists and they still let them have a political platform it didn't matter what kind of platform that but then but not Christians because we are a threat to the darkness amen so God is moving powerfully on our country so when Cavanaugh won that was a great victory for justice for generations so you should be really excited and celebrate every day of your life that God chose this time and he said I'm starting with America because I know who's going to win I know what their whole plan is I know the body of Christ had been praying and praying for years that he would come and heal our land and all those prayers were collected in bowls and they were chipped amen they were chipped so everyone who prayed that prayer Chronicles for generations in the past are a part of our victory today amen because he is healing our land and things are going to get better not worse amen so vote Republican I November to make sure you go vote there'll be angels in every voting booth [Music] people like you just wild yes I am I'm acting just like heaven because guess what they have seen the future they know the future when your loved one goes home God shows them the future they know what you're gonna be doing you're you're just you know you the generations after you won't be doing he knows it all he's been from the end at the beginning the beginning to the end and he knows all of it and he knows who he chooses is going to be what he wants him to be amen so I don't even know what time it is what time is it okay see I don't that's too small so that's what he wanted to talk about tonight he had me wear my patriotic and before when you allow the burning of our flag that flag will fly high everywhere and that image is being put on every kind of product possible you'll see a lot more red white and blue I saw hope businesses painting their businesses red white and blue I did everywhere I went and you know I've been placed aboard the red white and blue buildings clothing with it on it even some cars were painted red white and blue and I promise you you watch and see how many me how many automobile I didn't know what to call them the manufacturers Saint you Holy Spirit begin to send those cars and trucks out painted red white and blue it's going to happen more and more and more and our flag will be honored because it represents Christ event it represents Christ and America belongs to God America is a Christian nation [Applause] so I'm always happy to talk about America that is beautiful because God is here amen and along with that and the body of Christ beginning to manifest in amazing stunning shocking miraculous things that that is one of the reasons why God waited for the internet to do this because no one can stop those signs and wonders being seen all over the world amen I think a lot of people in this country are very tired of doom and gloom predictions this is not the time for God to use whether as judgment it's not this is the day of his power not the day of his wrath those things are recorded in the very end of the Bible don't jump ahead okay make sure we all walk out our lives and God's timeline this is the time for us to stop those things and it'd be strange that something is allowed to bring destruction through the weather because we won't tolerate it so how many people here have already be become weather warriors can I see our hands in here yeah where's the weather warrior you're taking authority over the storm every time and let me tell you the the meteorologists don't know what's wrong with their minds just like the fake news don't know what's going on the meteorologists don't know what's going on actually we actually typed out one of the reports after lane that was the hurricane that was opposed to hit Hawaii I think was a category 4 and it wasn't very far if this is going to hit hit the coast it's gonna do wipe out buildings and many people will be killed and the storm surge will go over the whole I mean they were making the most destructive you ever noticed how they're getting more destructive with her with her forecast like I understand if a storm comes but it's not wiping everybody out in the state okay it's not they're getting and the thing is this if it doesn't happen they have to fake it I don't know if any of you've seen that I have friends in Florida when one storm came through and it went down the middle and did almost no destruction it actually just did bypass Tampa completely and they were saying Tampa is gonna be head-on it's gonna wipe everybody out there was nothing and I think Roy fields if you know him Roy feels powerful recording artists he's been he was in the Lakeland revival he sings a lot for a lot of known his way he put it was remember the what he put it who's who in the Christian leaders ooh he said I have sung for them I have sung for them and he said but I've never heard this revelation before in my life I had had a chance to meet him and talk to him for about an hour and then his life was totally different he said we all need this revelation to know who we are he said I didn't even know who I was I didn't know I didn't know I lived in God before I was here I didn't know what actually was his offspring and so his whole life he had his head out of there encounter since then he came as the worship leader of the last cruise I was on and and he had an amazing time so revelation changes you but he himself had reported it on Facebook that they were trying to fake the storm doing destruction in his own City which was Kissimmee Florida and there wasn't any and they had like wind machines out there they have water like rising up around this and he said I'm standing out my street like there's not a drop of rain on me so he actually turned him in Peter Nevins said no there's none of that's going on and then we did have a report when it hit you know in Panama City I think I said and I'm trying to think I said neither said the airport or something was flooded with all the rain and that bill when they showed that was not even from there you have to understand they have got years of destruction of storms years of them and so they've been using some of them I'm not saying it wasn't actually saying there wasn't nothing that happened but even in Florence I do know there was there was flooding and stuff like that but you need to realize that if that category that storm and hit head-on they would have blown the buildings off the beach there would be no buildings there'd be nobody because it's like it was like a bowl and when that went think a mature it was a tropical storm it started as a four till we started taking authority over and you saw every single day the news media would say it would get stronger but it got downgraded and it even showed this thing zigzag because every time we would hit it it was exact and they went this is the weirdest storm in the history of meteorology we've never we could never predict it because we were telling it what it couldn't do the believers the sinners can't do that you don't have authority over the storms but the cuts again on Facebook you're gonna start a whole new move of God move of God means it's not gonna stop I've called the weather warriors and I will start in that way with the Bight of Christ who doesn't care whose denomination they belong to because those things affect everybody everywhere they're gonna lay down all I've no one ever said it was assembly god I'm Baptists I'm not I mean nobody ever said that to me on all the comments they never said that I'm so glad that we're taking authority over the storm of the body of Christ that's coming together we're doing this together and we are defeating them it was powerful amen so why don't we stand up and do something if you've never done it before we're going to take authority over the storms that are out there right now and the reason why they've been doing such horrible destruction is because we have let it happen Satan has run rampant earth ruling and reigning and the only ones who really could stop him was the body of Christ filled with Jesus Christ because we've been given power over all the power of the enemy Christ stop the storm amen and he said the things I did you will do is that true well we haven't been doing all the things but we are now so we're going to do this together say I choose as a child of God through the blood of Jesus Christ I take power over all the power of the enemy operating through any storm out there whether it's a tropical storm a hurricane no matter what it is we take power over that we come in the middle of ours to rise in that storm so the high pressure will crush us storm it will be downgraded until it becomes nothing we command the hosts of heaven to go in the storms begin to shred the bands all the way around the storm [Applause] we receive justice through the weather through Jesus Christ so be it amen amen amen sit down so we did it through the but Jesus gave us power worth while the enemy God did not on purpose create destructive weather to kill steal and destroy guess who kills steals and destroys yeah the devil does and now he's losing that remember the keys in hell that Christ took away from him death hell and the grave were those storms bring death and we were also given the keys to the kingdom is that right so Jesus has given us keys he's given his power and authority he's given us declarations he's given as an example how he lived his life we are joint heirs with him I was in law for eight years I totally understand what being a joint heir is you have the rights whatever he had we have whatever you did we can do that's what that means you're a joint heir the last Testament is the last will and testament of Jesus Christ just like in law he gave us us rights in that well amen and when he died and was risen again he even gave us power over death so you don't have to die from sickness and disease even as your soul prospers you will prosper and be in health it is so powerful to understand what the word means and how to apply it to your life that is getting training every missionary should know about commanding the host of heaven and sending them against all the darkness in the countries that their Minister being missionaries in anyone who works against human trafficking should know about using the host that is heavens army that was not created to defend heaven then didn't get to fight when Lucifer fell not one angel fought against any of those one-third of the angels God kicked him out on a lightning bolt he made heaven it is his home he is in charge of heaven so why did he make the hosts why did he make them there's a scroll in heaven that has been opened recently that talks about the destiny of the hosts that they cannot complete their own destiny without us they cannot on their own decide to go attack hell it would have been wiped out already they can't just get together and say ok let's see today we're gonna go to this country and wipe out all this we're gonna then we're going to go this one we're gonna do all this they have to have orders now I know they have positions they have inspectors they have people who command certain parts of the army they have positions like inspector to transport they have a scout to go behind the enemy lines and film all the activities of hell it goes back to headquarters heaven they have all of these positions that's why we have those positions in our army even in our own army those troops on her own the privates can get together and try to drive weapons off somewhere and attack something they can't do that they have to have orders as the military to operate and so does Heaven's military but we were created to be commanders there's many scriptures in the Bible that talked about commanding even God said command ye me didn't he he was not saying tell me what to do he was saying you command what will be done if you already know God you know what his desire is for something you already know it you're living righteous correct then you can call the army to come and fight on your behalf and not just fight on your head behalf but command it or God wouldn't say command Jesus was also the Lord of Hosts he was over the army what he did we can do I'm not here to tell you all the Scriptures I'm just telling you you need to command the army of heaven but the first thing you have to do is you have to realize that you were given power say the hosts of heaven we're not given power over all the power of the enemy say the angels are under us not over us do you understand that we came from inside God himself we are his offspring he spoke and the angels were made they were sent to protect us and keep us in all of our ways now some people knew that and they operated in that that's happened with people before but in this time he wants the body of Christ to realize stop fighting his plans the enemy wants you to fight God's plans because then you won't become what he wants you to become which is dangerous just a matter what your age is your position is how much money you have it doesn't matter if you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior then wash clean of all your sins you're kind of righteous you have entrance into heaven into all of eternity why wouldn't you be able to man say we're kings and priests unto our God those are spiritual levels of authority say every King commands an army in the earth as the body of Christ we are in the kingdom a spiritual Kingdom we have spiritual weapons we get to use them to pull down strongholds of darkness so wherever darkness is and evil is operating we can do something about it amen in this time off living yeah the Holy Spirit would always yell at me don't try it you do it don't just try it if we're supposed to live in a way that nothing by any means will harm us and people can quote that scripture all day long and yet harm comes to you doesn't it we're attacked by the enemy aren't we yeah well the army was designed and created to stop those attacks to keep you in all your ways amen because when we are free of fear of being attacked we can push back the enemy because he certainly is not expecting it so he doesn't like this meeting he doesn't like these words he doesn't like me at all that's okay I don't like him either he's on the bottom of my list actually he's under my feet he is our doormat the Bible even says so so we're not under but we are over because we rule and reign with Christ and the Bible says in this life not talk them up you know later on we will - not that they will not in the in the next life not your life but in the next time when there is no time when time is no more that's the end not the end of everything is the end of time when time when you don't have to have calendars and your body's not going to age and you have to be concerned about am I gonna have this to do that when that time of timeless comes when we're timeless I'm asking for that right now but you asked what you believe in your house do not doubt you should have whatsoever you say I'm saying I'm timeless he is reversing back to my youth the people in heaven are timeless no one is old if your grandmother or great-grandmother moved to heaven at 99 she is not coming back when they step out of this body they're 99 this step of the wrinkled right wrinkled hard of hearing their sight I say it's going they probably don't feel very good they can't run a job and they step out of that body no because of 25 do you think they're going back they aren't they'll pray for you and declare over you and make plans for you in heaven but they are not coming back they won't be happy and the day when we are timeless there will be no war no evil no sickness no disease no lack no threats no rejection of any kind and we will live like that through eternity but we can still create we can invent we can speak to things and they will appear you can ride on light you can ride on music be transported to light do time you have planets to visit for vacation the new heaven will be your home but you're going vacation to other planets he says there will be a new earth new heaven say it and a new earth the earth will not just be God's home in my father's house this is Jesus speaking in his house that's the world in this world this home that's called heaven are many mansions that's what's going on now but at the end of time when he makes a new earth bigger than our galaxy a massive earth that has one landmass in an ocean I know there'll be no more seas the sea separate the land masses but as long as God exists the river of life will never stop flowing from him that's how the crystal sea is made in heaven on the bottom is not saying just gemstones they flow out of the Father they're a part of him so if you should one day wake up and you have emeralds in your skin as a bracelet that's the father's image not even New Age can do that the devil tries to steal as much as he can he lived there remember he knew how things worked in a lot of things he says or his we're never is your life and eternity will be the most most splendors wondrous thing you've ever experienced people move to have a noun for R&R because they won't be there one day they'll be moving to the father's house right now they have a place in the father's house is that what the word says right now they go to prepare a place for you and the world called heaven which is the father's house but on the new earth it will be our house and he's going to pack his bags and climb on the New Jerusalem and we'll come down to the new earth and he'll be with us forever so even he is willing to move with this whole plan for eternity and we will be timeless we will have glorified bodies we will be immortal all of this is in the word mortality will take on immortality when he said know ye not that your gods that's the little G that's what he was talking about one day we'll be immortal like them we'll never die never sin will never lack we'll be timeless there'll be no time in heaven there's no time in the new earth and he'll create all these new things for us to go and put things on it for us to enjoy and have fun every planet will be different and you won't need a spacesuit or a spaceship to go there you'll be timeless this is a beautiful future isn't it so this little bit of time that we are on this earth but we will get to do supernatural the Bible says will be a type and group of people a generation a type and group of people those are those manifested sons and daughters of God it wasn't about Israel becoming a nation I know a lot of people think that generation was the generation they would still be here when Jesus came but a lot of them I've already died moved to heaven haven't they that was in 1948 is that correct Rick got that one in 1948 a miracle happened in Israel do what I'll fix my fix it is it falling off thank you for telling me honey I just I pinned my scars down these little scarves they'd be all the way on the floor I'd walk around with one little piece up here and it's on the floor I'm draggin and nobody ever told me nobody ever said oh my your scarf is swimming off of you so my team have little signs you see they give but you know he just kinda lets it go sometimes so we have been chosen by God to be here or you wouldn't be alive and sitting there people go maybe I wasn't chosen are you alive are you breathing were you born in this time you were chosen you were chosen and you're representing all those who went before you and you don't know who lived a thousand years ago maybe you do maybe you don't know but somewhere in your generational line was someone who laid down their life for the gospel and what he is doing is putting on the earth right now those who generational line somewhere lay down their life for the gospel so don't say you didn't have anybody you had somebody or you wouldn't be sitting here we get to help complete their destiny because he gives a destiny or a purpose for a generational line and even though they didn't get to complete it they started it they share and the same reward we got that's why they're so excited that you're here right now you are remember the body of Christ you are going to reap reward for you and them and they watch you do it they won't miss one time that you win someone to the Lord they won't miss one time that you manifest for God in this earth they will see all of it because we have a cloud of witnesses is that right according to Hebrews 12:1 we have a great cloud of witnesses watching our race that means they get to see it and they're excited and they're all cheering heaven is cheering they laugh every time Satan fails and he can hear them all the way down into hell and heaven roared the other day they're gonna roar on November 6 so I've really enjoyed this time with y'all I hope you were blessed by heaven amen amen and so just we never I told you all these things that I will be working God walked in the wall through the wall of my hotel room a couple months ago and he wrote on the wall literally what I'd be doing for the next 50 years that's not the end of my assignment but he wrote for 50 years the platforms I would speak from the very first one he was switching now don't be concerned I've been spending years many years revealing heaven but I'm in my next phase which is creating heaven to put in the marketplace a lot of people heard me talk about this a while we literally are this year starting to put things in the marketplace that look like heaven sound like heaven you'll be eating off of it wearing it walking on it listening to it you'll have walls that move and say things that's in heaven and so we're doing that now so he changed and switched my priority number one is the business world the marketplace the business world being CEO and putting stuff in the marketplace it represents heaven that this people really people in this world need that because right now Satan has put his mark on everything you wear it you have to stand you look at it it's in design it's an interior design architectural design it's in clothing it's an accessories it's in-home stuff isn't everything it's in all the schools it's everywhere so God is now putting heaven there amen and you can have things that represent in heaven and so I have to do that or we won't be there I'm not saying other people won't do it but we will majorly be impacting this world amen and number two will still be revealing heaven and training the body of Christ but number three will be the arts and entertainment world which means Hollywood so I will be seeing many times with celebrities in Hollywood directors producers and don't do it a lot about the Christians do oh my gosh that person's over there talking to Holly bit they're gonna go down the hole no Hollywood's changing how it was changing what they're gonna produce what they're gonna put out there what they're gonna market and even places of entertainment never had before and earth will be created for you to go and have good family fun Amen new hotel designs it's in it's totally invaded with heaven that the stuff in the rooms the stuff in the walls the stuff displayed there the things you can do while you're there it's all changing whole amusement parks will be lined up with what heaven is doing in the earth right now video games will be shown that young people can be part of working with heavens army destroying the darkness pushing back you know the evil and these video games instead of being invaded by hell they'll be invaded by heaven all kinds of things whatever young people like we're making it with heaven in it and so we all will have movies in the movie theaters that show a lot about heaven of time of the spirit round the spirit realm the spirit world they want the spirit realm they want that unseen realm they're so hungry for the unseen realm it's not a fake it's not a fantasy you know they'll stop running after maybe so superheroes for a while but definitely aliens will be put on the back burner although some of the hosts look like them so I just want to thank you for come tomorrow I have another powerful message to give to encourage and inspire you it's gonna be amazing you're gonna get some protocol from heaven on how to work with the army of heaven and things about your life to be accountable so that you can work with them because tell you heaven I know they hear the prayers of sinners people think they don't but they do he hears the prayers of sinners he couldn't he couldn't answer them amen heaven here's everybody's words but the army is not going to listen to someone trying to command them when they're sinning when they're sweating people you're not going to do it they will stay in there and stare at you so if you want to be a part of using them as one of your spiritual weapons and sending them all over this world the potent strongholds of darkness expose the wicked people themselves take them down not kill them unless they have to I will let you know this that I do know like for Cavanaugh God is releasing ho I'm trying remember what do you call like a truth beam a group of military like what aliens yeah he's sending ho battalions of the hosts that have flesh on them and they were the ones that fought against the armies of Israel they actually fought in the flesh and fought against the flesh they are being released into this earth to keep the lives of those who say yes who say who are willing who are bidden who say yes and who live your life the way we should is an example of Christ so there are things gonna be change I'll be talking about more of that tomorrow and some of the strategies for sending the hosts you need to do it it will change your life you'll never be in a traffic accident you own your plane will be the safest plane in the sky because they will carry you through the sky you can you will not escape seeing parts of your army because they will live over your home they're not gonna be snow no Simon and go back to heaven they're being assigned to earth to the body of Christ who can command and that is your choice so is there anything else in salsa dude I will get a great night's sleep so thank you for blessing me for coming in man you can't

let's welcome cat everyone up here okay being the mother of three highly anointed dancers who were born years apart from each other I planned mine being 1:15 I thought if I ever have them being number three out of 15 I said if I ever have them I'm planning them on purpose far apart so I can enjoy my life in between and get to know each one of them so I did I had them five years apart within the same month but five years apart except the middle one I needed seven years before I had to turn off but God was amazing he gave them all the exact same gift their natural gift they will still use in heaven is dance they've danced probably some of them for 30 years some 25 years and highly gifted they've raised the debt by dancing they've had people more actually healed by dancing they do intercession and warfare by dancing so much so that my middle daughter has brass knuckles this big tattooed on the top of her feet because there are weapons of God God told her to do it and so everywhere she goes she would have pink hair purple hair she was on so you think you could dance so she could witness and testifies to the judges because she had already been dancing since she was four so what I think she's like 20 something after 20 years of dance she went said I'm going to testify I know they won't put me all the way through because I'll be preaching the gospel at one point and they passed her through every test she mentored sixty other dancers who were going to be trying out because they all had to wait in a room for five days as you waited for your turn and the first day you showed up they they gave you a test they played music for 10 seconds have you passed those judges you were in for the rest of the thing and so every level she would pass every level so she got her try on the platform so she could testify and her here at that time was cut a little bit shorter but it was red with purple overtones and she had her she had a Rose of Sharon on her arm her brass knuckles on her feet and it was modern dance so she didn't have to wear shoes and this was her moment they played the music and she dances so powerfully anointed people just sit there like stunned they don't know what to do they don't know what it is so they said and the whole time she's preparing what she was going to save them and so they said well we know who you are you must be really hot they said the wrong word so why are you here look at you your cool tattoos and she stood up with her moment she said you think you know who I am but I'm a believer in Jesus Christ I get my anointing from him I dance and warfare and worship I destroy the darkness through my movements I make every movement I make us for him it is to worship Him he is my God I will serve no other and they all were sitting there stunned and they finally said we can't pass you through nope nope nope nope we can't pleasure they were so terrified thinking she would do that while she did it on stage she said I did not come to win I came to testify to you that God has young people in this earth so down on fire for him who will not compromise with the world but will make a stand for righteousness and holiness and that's why I came and I fulfilled my commission and they centered and all of the younger people cuz you know they're like what 1718 cent like that and they were so angry because she was so powerful that wasn't fair she said I didn't come to win and every day they meet in this room and they'd all get tweaked you know they do their their thing trying to get better she helped every one of them with their with their routines and she would make them pray first and these kids were from all over the world in every walk of life in every ethnic group and they learned to pray to Jesus and she was um she's don't you ever stop praying he gave you that gift I'll be rooting for every one of you and so this is the heart of my daughter's this is what they were raised in that that was who they were they weren't something else they never went into the world to find out who they were they knew they all still dance they all still minister they performed some have dance companies and and they're very powerful and I'm blessed that God said if you raise up in child and the way he made them to be they will never depart from that because it's knowing their gift and being that gift so I love dance I have 20 years of videos of taping I was the videographer I don't have a clue about dance myself I can't dance except in one day and so I teach everybody when they go somewhere I've been throwing out a Jazzercise classes so that shows you that was not my gift but we got to see all these years of them using that gift they never dropped it and one of them has actually danced here before Kim my daughter Kim and she wants to come back she's gonna help me talk to you about doing an arts a whole arts it's called arts alive and they'll she'll teach dance they have artists that will teach art and they have others that will teach worship you know powerful it's powerful it's like a two day event and and people come in for the first time learn how to express yourself and dance so she has two classes one for those who have experience and those who have no experience and you'll never be the same again and like the fine art is beautiful and amazing they teach you prophetic art like with brushes and paints and stuff and then the worship thing is phenomenal and these are all experts in their field professionals in their field and Kim said as it was leaving mom make sure you asked them and see if they want us to come you know we would love to come yeah she wants to very much come and do that so I'll have to let her know the answers yes but when they started because dance is one of the hottest things done in the throne room it's called in sums 149 it's high praise read Psalms 149 it talks about dance being high praise it binds the enemy in fetters of iron it's a very powerful weapon it is worship but it's also warfare and I want you to know when they first started the fire started pouring down from heaven blue fire blue fire was coming down all over this platform it was around every single dancer and then about halfway through the line of Judah walked in that wall right here huge lion it was Jesus and receiving the honor and the praise they were all dancing around him they didn't couldn't probably see that the other thing that happened was I almost never see this but the Seraphim showed up the Seraphim live over the throne in a cloud of glory and they come down and they do dance in the air above the throne their heads are so on fire with blue fire their hair is blue fire and they were right up here in between these two areas right here and they would dip down and bring more release more fire in here on the dancers so the throat the throne-room was here today okay receiving the honor and the praise from the dancers it's a very glorious thing in heaven to see that happen and so I was delighted when I came and they danced cuz I love to see that I love to see it's very powerful and so truly one of their dance directors was very ill one time and so my oldest daughter and my middle daughter who actually ended up by teaching and taken over the studio for a while danced and she was raised up off her deathbed and they did it for that purpose they were interceding for her to be made whole and she lived she was raised up from the dead and she lived another 10 years a wonderful the first Christian dance company in our entire city the company became 200 members in the company and then the director needed a new knee so my oldest daughter took over the company and three studios and worked all over for her and gave her all the money and so because she loved her because from the time she was 8 she had taught her she used to dance the the director with the New York City Ballet and she had danced all over the world we decided at one point I'm done with this I'm giving myself to Jesus and she got saved and came and started the father's company and so powerfully effective impacted our whole city and now Miss Laury is in heaven watching right now so so dance is something wonderful if you're if you're any of your children they had some guys that did too they didn't wear tutus at anymore tights but they were powerful dancers also and I know people you say dance a picture all ballet there's many other forms of dance you know that they can be involved in and and I loved it with your I was trying to remember what the father calls it and with your battle stick he calls it a battle stick they have those in the throne rooms and the men are the ones who use them in the zone I'm like wow they really got heaven here today and some of you may not even understand what I'm talking about but it's a powerful thing to connect with heaven and then you duplicate it down here okay so if you don't have a church this is a powerful place to come god loves this place not that he doesn't love other places but they give everything to him their lives their gifts and they do it on purpose and intentionally and they're passionate about it God loves to see passion and his people he loves it when you respond when you yell when you get excited when you jump up and down he loves let me tell you heaven is not a quiet place if you're expecting it to change your mindset because if you're 80 you won't feel 80 in heaven you'd be like 20 and if you're already young when you get there you are so excited beyond reason the things that you get to experience and do in heaven they don't even have on this earth heaven is not earth the earth is only a shadow literally a shadow of what is in heaven it's way beyond your imagination don't ever limit God in your lives even here not even here and so never thought I would be chosen to do this not ever in my wildest dreams I didn't like talking to anybody I didn't want anybody to hug me or touch me I was a covert person from the beginning and yet had to be a leader at age eight over my siblings and help and then when as I got older it just increased but I was a very faithful and committed to help my parents I was on my parents side that did not make me popular with the rest of my siblings and being a seer and having supernatural discernment even when I'm like eight nine and ten they didn't get away with anything I was literally know what they were gonna do before they even got to do it okay and so I've met and go retrieve them or whatever they were thought they were going to get into it never happened and my mom would always say I'm leaving you to be in charge the house will still be here they won't burn it down you know they won't have fights in the streets I mean when you got that many kids together and that many personalities there's gonna be a lot of action all the time and so uh and in my husband that God made me marry he said this is one I chose before you were born this is who I chose to you to marry I need you to marry him I need the holy seed you're gonna produce I mean this is how direct God is with me how detailed he is with me and he said you're gonna have three daughters and I need them born into this earth I tried to get out of having the last one that didn't happen I am paid in full right now okay and I only have one that's not married yet and she thinks you might want to be I'm not quite sure about that we'll see what happens nothing is for certain when God's involved in your life and he's got destiny for you he'll get you one way or another okay and that is a that's a good thing it's a god thing be excited for your life he could have had you born 300 years ago nobody would be dressed the way you're dressed nobody would have any of the conveniences of things you would have you know you'd be climbing on some old wagon train hauling around behind cow dung and flies whatever you find and caught that's what you ate you might have a bath once every three months no tell me where that would take place and I for one I always thank God that he had me born now if it had not been the kind of person I didn't like getting dirty I didn't want to get wet I didn't like to sweat that was me so shoving me back 300 years ago I've probably not have been a happy person and so I'm always grateful that I'm born in this special time on the earth well we will see things never seen before on the earth really some things will directly be sent from heaven right in our midst in the most unusual unexpected places a lot of these signs and wonders will not be done even in the midst of a huge big meeting with thousands of people it may be done in your grocery stores [Music] you may take you out through the wall in the grocery store your left your cart will be left behind take you somewhere do some miraculous thing out bring you back your your kosher cart will still be there trust me nobody will take anything out of it and these things will be so spectacular he actually does intend to use you he's not looking for holy recruits out of some of the highest known people you know they're all important they did what they did in the past but in this time God wants teams and groups of people who are willing to work together even though we're different no don't wait for everything trust me we have a team don't wait for every person to line up with the way you think they should be okay if God sent them he sent them and he sent them for a reason and you have to love all them and let them use the gifts God put in them and be excited about it because if all you ever do is complain about those people they're probably never gonna change okay when you can be happy about them and ask God to bless them you actually be surprised at how wonderful they are so you can't expect because he's a powerful days that everything will look perfect or be perfect it will be powerful and there's a big difference between perfect and powerful it will be so powerful when we start coming together and doing things when God says to do it not wait five years to do it but do it he said pray that my people are willing in the day of my power that means lay down your differences you know don't wait for everything to be perfect because we aren't any of us actually perfect right we're all a work in progress but if you have a passion for him and what he wants and he brings other people to be a part of that you should be very excited I get excited all the time although our whole group I don't know of anybody who's perfect know they're all still working on I'm still working on it and so as long as you're going in a forward motion and not sitting and waiting on the side you're gonna do something for God right so I can tell you God is opening more and more the eyes of the everyday believer to begin to see into the spirit realm because it's coming people go well you say things yes I do say things and because I do prophesy that might be in that in the past that could been 10 or 20 years but that's not happening now I know things I said seven years ago are literally happening right now things God showed me I would be doing is happening now and that now is going to open up the whole rest of the floodgate for a lot of other things just to start accelerating we've been in and accelerating the season but more now in the not just the acceleration but we're being motivated to be thrown out there don't look in the mirror and say I don't qualify don't ever say that word you know why you qualify you're alive guy said if you're still alive and you're not in heaven yet you belong to him you're qualified okay the world won't we choose people that they think qualified but God qualifies the chosen it matters what he says about us it matters how why he made us okay so no matter what you think about yourself he qualifies you I was just a little skinny girl they didn't blend well with other people at one point my line I think I talked to two people in all of high school they didn't really know who I was but I was not the person they probably thought I was I did a lot of covert things even for the law they never would have expected me the last person I'm playing earth that they thought could have done some of the things I did and yet God qualifies me and I said yes every time he asked me something and I didn't always have the best attitude growing up I wasn't happy about most things I didn't like almost no food I never slept I mean I was a lot of high maintenance for my mom and she'll assure you of that if she was here right now she would tell me live every day in my life of a strange because I didn't fit the rest of the group you know everybody ate everything they slept normal they did what was expected I never did anything that was expected I ate once a day that was about 1:00 or sleeping I sleep four hours a day so I'm up 20 hours a day what was I gonna do for the extra time I read I was an avid reader I read things that were exciting and interesting I'm an avid horse lover although I don't know one I'm sure I have a herd in heaven and I was fascinated with him you know in the Bible God talks so much about the horse he thinks it's one of the best things he ever made in the animal kingdom he loves horses and we're kind of in horse country right now right I plan one day to have a range somewhere around here with a whole lot of horses I'm not making that up and serious about that I can come and visit my friends and get away I'll have to get away to places already planned in Maine because God said the demand will be so great he'll have to just take me and I'm perfectly happy with that - so get ready to not be normal or think normal and and I will tell you just watch out for the quiet ones you have a child that's quiet there a very deep thinker and God has put a lot in them and I always know when I look around see people real quiet mm-hmm God is gonna do something with you and stick you out there in front of everybody because I was the core I was the quiet when I hardly said anything but all the time things were going on and the spirit around me and so I'm excited today to be here I have given up so much already last night was so powerful it was phenomenal it was so powerful it really was it was amazing and so I always like to ask how many people have never heard me before that are here today any new people a couple people well I don't look normal unless you live in a kurta certain states couple states you know maybe Portland they have a lot of highlights in their hair some places in California do but I learned not everybody does I learn literally last week for a whole week was in Hollywood going over a contract to get a spirit round content for a movie being made right now and that is the resurrection of Jesus Christ to put things in there that people have seen in the Bible but maybe didn't have revelation on it it will be live on the big screen and people will be shocked and stunned to know what Christ did in hell on the third day any man how he wasted hell in their leader is gonna be very powerful and just in case anybody wondered God loves colored highlights in your hair because you're wearing heaven culture this is heaven culture on my head when a lot of people go why you do that you know some places in Florida have highlights that I don't think West Virginia not much in South Carolina you know unless you're a headline or somewhere maybe but when I used to travel through those areas they would come out of the kitchen they would come out of the kitchen where they were cooking to see who I was when it would stop but there were little barbecue places or something like that they all would get around my table and I'm just waiting for their little but we had a meeting right there and it was all talking about heaven and how they lived in heaven and how exciting powerful was and they walked away so stunned you know oh my god am i lights in heaven and we can't have them where we work I want to start prayin it is coming it's gonna become normal just like pierced ears if you weren't around in that day they thought you were gonna go straight to hell if you pierced ears because you were doing idol worship you know like back in Leviticus well we don't live in Leviticus days and I always like to correct people the way they quote scriptures although some of the translations now actually says don't realize yourself to be tattooed they mistranslated that because what it says no Leviticus it says do not marks do not allow marks of the Dead to be put on your body they didn't say don't mark yourself you have marks in heaven that God puts on you it's what you put on you and the reason you put them on you and I have to say that even though people might be uncomfortable you may be living in heaven a point at one point wondering why God ever said that and then you'll get some yourself but it's coming because as we go through time in it's a new time new things are introduced on the earth some men kind of comes goes along with but some of them actually come from heaven and God at one point will ask people personally to put his marks on them like my daughter the brass knuckles on her feet that was before that actually was going around in our city and and she wore sandals in Florida where foot flops or sandals so nobody could miss them right and they knew what she did but when they looked down on her feet Oh do you know you like I don't know your daughter has tattoos of the enemy oh no no that's evidence that she's a gift to crush the enemy that's what those are there for so for all of you who ever wondered about that God will mark you when you get to heaven it says in the Bible that you'll have the mark of the city of your God in your forehead and your God in the palm of your hand which is why Satan wants to use those same two places in the tribulation why did he pick those two places it clearly says that that that number of the item to Christ will be in your palm or in your forehead he only picks what God already has you can't think of anything new himself the microchip is not the mark of the beast and neither is the barcode which they thought it was before the chip came along for forever and ever mankind has tried to picture it so usually in a tract of stuff they just put a big 666 on the forehead or the person that in the Bible track to explain that this was someone who gave themselves to Satan in the in those days that haven't come yet and aren't going to be for quite a while but the barcode and the microchip especially in microchip does it wouldn't count you can't see it say Amen I know if enough about Satan that whatever he does pick will be this big you see a half a mile away people walking down the street because he is adamant about being known and wanted and that day people will have to want that mark no one can be forced at gunpoint to take it a lot of these movies they show about the last days they show people in in cells with guns and stuff threatening them to get it that won't happen that's not reality reality is they will have to choose him as their leader and that is a result of choosing the Antichrist or Satan as their leader that mark that will be clearly seen on the people will be put on them so forget the microchip it's just a good science you know thing to help find people and your pets and stuff or maybe save the fact that you don't have to carry wallets around with you they're always going to be coming up with new technology no one has technology like heaven okay so don't worry about it it's not your job to be concerned about any of that and God wouldn't let you take something that wasn't him anyway you have to remember that you belong to him you gave yourself to him that is not gonna be something that's hidden when that day comes it will not be hidden the people who live in that time will clearly know what they're saying no to or what they're accepting your job is to rule and reign in the power of the Living God and ways never done before you're living in one of those exciting times to be alive on the planet and the Bible says if people who live in heaven could come back it would only be to do that with you to be a part of this time doing the supernatural manifesting for your God on this earth the rain erasing the great area that says there is not a God so that's what they would come back for amen but you're here you're here you're in this meeting and you'll be held accountable by knowing that you were chosen you're breathing you're alive you're not in heaven okay so he's letting anyone who wants to to be a part of what he's doing in this earth you just have to understand don't try to escape don't think that you can live out the time waiting for the rapture to come and I am NOT saying it's not coming he is clearly going to come back when the father sends him what Christ wants you to do is operate in his power say his power supernatural power in front of others to demonstrate there is a God so in the past people were you know they go door to door and you can still do that minister to people when people - cries it's gonna be done a little bit differently not that we'll ever be stopped but there's a lot of people who've already been approached people in this day a lot of them know things that people never knew in the past a lot of its the internet has been used for a lot of God not just evil and that was made by God for His purposes it was never made to be evil but Satan gets involved in every single thing he can get away with don't let him get away with anything with you okay I love what she's helping she said that I say that to him if I see him a lot who are you fooling because I don't belong to you I'm talking about Satan appearing I don't belong to you why are you here you're wasting your time I know I have authority I know I have power over all the power of you and all of yours so you don't waste your time coming here and then he leaves because I put myself under the hand of God no I'm not afraid of anything I've already been told by God if anybody tries to take me my life they will not let them and if you know somebody wants to take your life I will not allow you to pray for them that means they're in very big trouble so I don't have any fear and I'm willing whatever God wants however long he wants to say whatever he wants and I'll have a great opportunity to do that now I'm because of but I'll be involved in I'll get to meet kings and CEOs and millionaires and I promise you they'll hear from God Hollywood's gonna have a lot of God in it amen and I was just a little skinny girl that's what I was as what people thought it was and then later on when I got involved in my church I loved my church I served in my church I loved my pastor and his wife I was very committed and sold out to them and one day God had me write a letter and say I was married to them and they read that letter in church she didn't read my name and they wept and they said we wished everyone here loved us that much that they were committed to hold up our hands to pray for us every day to help us in any way they wanted to I was serious God sent me there to be a blessing amen that meant scrubbing the floors working in children's church doing VBS I have another word for that and won't tell you what I think about that it's a killing station not for the kids question when you're stuck with the 7 year old so 8 year old the three and four year olds were easy when you start thinking you have a mind of your own it changes this one little boy I had was like a thorn in my flesh he always had a better idea it did not matter what we had prepared in VBS you have to have if you are not prepared you will have in our key and mayhem you will be overthrown like a government by well prepared children so you have to have exciting fun things for them to do but this one kid always had a better idea every single name was Micah I should have been suspecting he always wanted to do it his way which was messing up the plan that kid is such a peril of each list go is SiC him on the devil he's very powerful when man I guess it was worth it loving him anyway it is fun to see those you help as children be raised up and be so powerful to forgot I'm gonna I knew you were gonna become something so it's wonderful to have a life sewn to God even in your in perfectness even in your mistakes even in all those things God looks at your heart and he loves every one of you even if you feel alone yourself you are not alone you have angels around you everyone here has angels everyone in here has probably at least 3 to 5 angels you don't have just one some of you have a lot and most of them are very happy right now that you're sitting in those seats because every word ice because anointing in it and it goes in your soul whether you know that or not the words won't leave your soul because God wants you to know you are powerfully made you are so powerfully made if you ever really saw who you were you would be so bold the devil would get so terrified he doesn't attack you because he's afraid he doesn't attack you because he's angry he doesn't get angry he's too smart to be angry he knows what happens when he makes people angry he's gets you stuck but he does attack you because he's terrified of you and he's hoping you never ever find out who you are I've even said this in a men's prison Danone Yin began to hit every one of them the anointing they carried because you got you're given an anointing for some purpose they're very anointing begin I can see it begin to rise out and come and discover them and they begin to weep they begin to shake they never thought of their self that way I'm sure nobody ever came and told them that their treasures hidden in darkness so when light comes in and removes the scales off of their eyes then they get angry at Satan even though they know what they did was wrong and they're paying a price for that they get anything that he trapped him he trapped them he hunted them he got them to fall he kept encouraging them to do wrong then he made them get caught how about man he might have been put away where they would never get to be who they were sent to be and every time I go speak everything every one of the men got saved filled with the Holy Spirit and then I really saw fire of God into them I said whatever God has planned for you you can be powerful right here you can make a difference right here don't you let one demon show their face in this place don't you let them think they have authority over you belong to Jesus Christ you are now a weapon for God in this place and sometimes ho blocks and the prison would get saved including the warden because of these people running after Jesus Christ letting him work Foley through them even in the prisons there's gonna be movement from the prison's one day so maybe you're not in a building but you're in a prison don't stay there god I declare every person in this room right now that has been chosen by you that belongs to you that has a divine purpose I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control any of them steal their destiny crush them beat them up in Jesus name I command the hosts of heaven you get in here right now you pull down every stronghold you shred every platform Satan's been running over in their lives right now that they might be free free free everybody out free free in Jesus name Amen amen that's how you pray over your family get serious about it amen then celebrate because your words are powerful they have life in them they have power in them if Christ lives in you when you speak it's like him speaking amen so you are important to God every person is important there was a lot of them messed up out there they don't even know who he is don't know how much he loves them but the moves that are coming in the habitation that is coming to this earth they will know he's going to move on every single person without permission I know you said well they have to have permission sometimes they do sometimes things are sovereignly done and this already been declared in the world in the last days what does he say do you ever think that through in your head I will pour out my spirit on all flesh that means everybody on the earth without permission I know what that feels like begin to burn on the inside of you too you think you're going to explode then the flood of the life of God comes in on top of that burning and it actually comes out of the pores of your body it consumes your whole head it begins to erase things on your soul the walls of your soul he begins to bleach them white from things that happen to you in the past or maybe you even did in the past it will be like you there's no way to remember it because it's gone and people when that begins to happen through things will happen they'll either run to God or run into the darkness and both of those things will happen but a lot of them will run after God they'll actually drag people out of home he's an ass and do you know who God is do you know him do you know him on the street do you know him do you know him do you know him do you know him I just felt him I need to know who he is it'll be happening everywhere even in churches your neighbors have been watching you knowing how you live your life maybe making fun of you or harassing you or something they won't be doing that when that happens they don't pound your door down until you answer it there's gonna be a hunger predators like never before since this earth was made to know the one who made them if you're young you have a powerful life ahead of you if you're not young ask to be timeless because he's into restoring you that means the way you look and the way you feel you have to declare you have to declare it you have to declare it I know that works the whole thing about whatever you say your words if you don't waste your words and a bunch of crazy stupid stuff but you make them very focused you've already learned one of the biggest secrets in the Bible you should have whatsoever you say he really means that if it's not for something you know just to spoil on yourself it's not just about you now being timeless is not just a view he wants you to be timeless how will restore your youth how many people have been saying that when I was young I was smart when I was young I would read stuff and then I actually believed it in the Bible I literally believed it and so I would act on it when I was young even though it was quiet out to people I was never quiet to God go in my room when I had a moment to myself at a dorm room with my four sisters at home I go out in the yard at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning cuz nobody was out there but the frogs lizards no alligators but a lot of other creatures were in Florida you got at night you're gonna find some don't worry the alligators don't walk around like dogs unless they've been trained to walk on a leash then maybe people do crazy stuff there I would just get along god I would start saying to his word to him your word says this okay I'm not participating with the change in my life when that thing comes it sounds like a curse to me you know when women go through the change I have seen women in my life goes I said that sounds like a curse I'm not I'm not under the curse I was just clearing I will not participate in any way whatsoever I'm gonna wake up in the morning it'll be done so when I turned 55 I went to sleep when I woke up I was done I didn't have one symptom not one single symptom of anything I was not participating with it so if you're young girls say it you don't have to participate okay to me that looked like a curse I wasn't going to have it I believed it and I said it and I reminded my god I've been born again I'm no longer under the curse I received nothing of the curse so I don't want age I started adding age I don't want to look old no matter how old I am I don't want to look codon won't ever be old I always want to be new every day and I'm not just fitting in that and I think I was like twelve when I said all that but at 55 all those years later when all my friends started having that I say I'm not participating are you participating are you planning are you literally planning for that why so 55 I went to bed one way I woke up done no hot flashes for me no other so I wasn't going to participate with it so say that about yourself right now no matter how don't expect your hearing to go don't expect your joints to hurt don't ever expect one day you'll need a cane to walk don't don't prepare for it and if you are reverse it I'm not preparing to be old [Applause] I'm expecting to get younger then you don't think like old people I don't know if I can get out of bed someone bring me my okay I'm not making funny I'm just saying that even society and the commercials if you love hallmark never listen to the commercials by the end of six months you'll have all the diseases they've been putting in you you'll have symptoms of them because you're filling your soul if I'm somewhere in my house I might turn that new to not participating I'm not gonna have that sickness that disease I'm not taking medicines that kill me faster than the diseases I'm not protect I'm yelling this at the top they can't wait to get a whole thing to miss that I don't want in here I'm not listening don't listen to it we just go on our life accepting and receiving because what you hear is going in your soul even you young people what you hear is going in here you get enough in there that's what you will become if you don't like you there is something in your soul get it out if people have been barred and been beating you up get all those words out cuz that's not who you are if you live in a family that bachelor's each other all the time loose all the words go outside and lose some of your soul and and you know put God in there instead go back in a different person in the past we didn't know what to do about it but what you can you just choose to do it amen be free and stay free this is a powerful time you have to understand you're a supernatural being [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we represent heaven but have we been living like it it's no wonder the world doesn't want him we have not been very good examples or witnesses have we and it doesn't matter where you live those people don't rule your life you still make choices release the anointing into every wall in your home in the floors your family be walking on sit on the furniture release the anointing then no one ain't brakes top you live with that it's in you first John 2:20 what is it where's the horse Rick it's the first John 2:27 yes yes when you become born again you get a deposit of anointing and it abides that means lives in you that anointing the anointing that Christ operated in that anointing that someone touched the hem of his garment and healed him the anointing that Peter and Paul uses so much there was a cloud of it around them you have it whatever you put it on it won't ever wash off or wear off go to your family home put it in the refrigerator handle I bet everybody touches that handle I do this we've had testimony from people who actually tested it in family members who were angry for 20 years got restored them because they had so much in the anointing of John they touch the refrigerator handle it would go up in them the anointing breaks the yoke at the workplace make sure you're using it okay I was still working in the world when I found out about this and I would sit and everybody's cheer after work in our break room I touched every table they didn't have cameras way back then they didn't have the money to put canvases that they didn't know I don't know what they would have thought about me everybody liked me in my job even the sinners I work for attorneys had 80 attorneys that's a lot of people in that building I had great favor with them they would not swear around me they just they wouldn't know what to say sometimes because that was their normal length but you know talking about languages that was their normal language when I came around I just didn't say anything they just take their head and wave didn't want to swear I would really see no we had so many people get saved in that company cuz the anointing was on everything it was in the floors and the walls I was gonna make sure I coated it you don't ever run out your favorite restaurant make sure you leave it in the tables you know drop something and touch the floor you can wash your hand later because it literally comes out of you I got a real creative eye I put it on the wheels in my car and the anointing is like fire if you can see it it looks like fire so when I Drive fire tracks everywhere I go people cross over them they drive over them you know when he goes up inside their car it gets on them see you can be creative you give me do covert operations till he throws you out there you know I'm because the more you use it the more powerful it becomes it does something else it burns the demons like you put a flame torch on you that's what it does to them they don't like that fire that's God's fire so how about that run them out of your neighborhood oh yeah Jen like Glen you see when you see stuff there's residue left by other people who are really looking they leave a residue of the enemy and so we see that when we go places before I sit down anywhere now I will touch that seat and I'll say I'll cleanse it for the kingdom and then the fire of God does this and removes it in hotel rooms oh my hotel is in my favorite place you know what I do it's 3:00 in the morning I walk down the hall in touch every door now I know they have cameras I don't what they think but I'm not doing anything harmful when I check in I let them know I pray you may see me in the hallways I'm just praying for a big never oh well that's lovely thank you for giving me permission because I released it before I get in the hotel I send the host to drive every demon out of every hotel I'm not tolerating him around me and I see them running out okay I see the host going there and literally running them out then I released the life of God into the hotel even into the whole place you know how people sometimes don't treat you nice we always get treated nice because they're actually beginning to bask in the anointing that's covering the entire counter that they are touching as they register me I do get upgrades I put it in the planes I put it in every Airport I'm not gonna waste my life just walking around breathing everywhere you go you can do something people said I like to pierce a demon we release the anointing you physically is a physical person cannot attack a demon just in case you ever wondered there are spiritual beings but you have spiritual weapons in you there can be leashed upon them I'll go by places that I know you know places of ill repute that's the nicest way to say it I will send the anointing in there like fire and I can see through the walls I see the demons streaming as it hits them they begin to scream and ride then they're burning in this fire from God the place gets extremely boring because there's nothing in there to and you know empower sin or whatever's going on my one sister not Jen I say that I have a sister who was kidnapped and dragged away when she was young we prayed her we finally got her back years later and and she didn't trust anybody but but right now limite she's a firehouse she is on fire for God she is she is so destroying places of darkness you know that demonic and everything she's also a seer and in her life there's time in her life but she would dance in clubs and she knew every time I drove by seriously would tell me this she said you know I know you drove by earlier today didn't you why yes I did she said the men fell asleep on the counters [Laughter] and she would stand there dancing and she look at the paper we may as well go home my sister just override she's released to fire God in here and every demon is left my family's very real wasn't so God did something even better than at a time when we didn't have a place he moved me in with her her places one of the place that I slept on the floor there was so much anointing you would float in it when he came in the door and she finally came in one day literally threw her stuff her bags and I'm giving up I cannot do this anymore I come home there's anointing I'm gonna work you've release the anointing it's in the clothes I'm wearing it's in my closet it's in my bag I'm carrying I'm just gonna have to leave and she quit so if God has moved you in family there is a reason please release it so no one can tell me this doesn't work you can't tell me it's too late she would literally call me this place is dead and we actually did shut a place down literally it was one of the biggest clubs and I kept declaring that it would be taken to the ground there wouldn't be a brick left because it sucked up the lives of young girls who my sister would win to the Lord while she was in that club and she told me you don't have to live like this I know Jesus Christ is this crazy she's running from him but she said I know I can help you you can quit God can give you a life I know you have children I know you hate this they usually do most all of them heat it and she says so I'm gonna go pray with you back here i'ma lay hands on Jesus crazy she said I know I still have anointing it's been really dormant but I'm gonna pray for you to receive Jesus Christ and if you do this I will promise you she'll find a better job and every single time it worked for her every time these girls want to be mentored by her but she wasn't even serving god she said no I'll show you a place you can go and go and get fed spiritually and she said I know one day I'll have to give up what God finally got tired of waiting on him so he moved me in the anointing breaks the yoke and you can't deny you have it there is a scripture that talks about it and if I say these words the anointing does what everyone in the room knows it breaks the yoke well that's the anointing that's in first John 2:27 did you get a deposit off when you received Christ how long ago was that it's been sitting in you waiting for you to let it out the more you let it out it will come outside your whole being it can't even be contained inside it will be outside you and sometimes listen to this if I want you I could fill the whole room with mine cuz so many years every day of my life I loose it I feel it leaving me when that woman touched the hem of His garment in me to demand on that what did Christ say he felt it leaving him that was power that was the anointing that totally healed that woman totally after years it races people from the dead it drives demons out of people it heals people in this world because in that world that's how they used it in this world think send it over the internet through every single phone call it will go and if you don't do it guess what it's not gonna happen just do it it's in the Bible it was used in the Bible it didn't go away God's never changed that I teach children to do it so by the time they're 30 they could probably feel like a whole city block if not more by your presence someday someone will walk through a hospital when every person has healed because you're walking down the hall not even touching them it will be the anointing that you carry every missionary team should be training their people wherever they go to release the anointing okay there you go there's where that there's that that's the anointing the anointing you haven't deposited up it's a deposit because when you put it out you get more the more you give out the more deposits the more you never stop never stop I get mine I get I get refilled all day long every single day I get more and I release it in the entire buildings I don't want the enemy bad I wasn't born to live with him and I'm never tolerating him in my presence if you remember the bodies of the Christ lived like this what would this world look like by one simple thing not even all the rest it's available just by one little simple thing yes you could prove as in the Word of God they're scripture to back it up you have to be willing well you have to even know first because this is not always taught in church every new Christian should be taught about the anointing every single one should know you are powerful you are dangerous you have weapons against hell built-in you put in you from the day you receive Jesus Christ and no one can say I don't want that they don't even have to know you've used it it is a secret weapon unless people need it and then they come and ask when you lay hands on them always always always release the anointing always every time you shake a hand say in your spirit every DS it's a spiritual weapon come here come up here I'm gonna show you when you meet somebody somebody goes you go I'm gonna say it out loud bits with you and she says hi and ago hi how are you doing the whole time I can feel it going on in my arm into her arm so you don't even have to tell people use the anointing people if you don't even want to know the the deeper higher stuff that maybe boggles your mind sometimes if you were in heaven some of the stuff you saw would do that to your head if you saw some of the army of heaven you'd really you probably fall under chairs they're fierce they have Spears coming out of the entire body they go into the camp an enemy and they spin and shred their name is shredder they're my friends in heaven you will have angels as friends it won't be weird they've always been there they've always been made by God having a friend is not worshiping they have assignments they're very focused on their assignment on this earth at this time because evil is still here what did you think they were gonna do one day what are they gonna do sticking a little group somewhere in a cloud when the devil's not here seriously think about things like that in your head sometimes they have personalities they're exciting they like things they have things they like that things they don't like they have opinions about you now if they're your guardian angel they always think you're perfect and amazing they sometimes get frustrated they go home for R&R that's why you need more than one and we laugh but this is truth [Music] here our supernatural being carrying their light of God and the glory is wrapped around you and you're living with humans they have conversations we're gonna have a sitcom one day about guardian angels it will be a comedy and God is perfectly okay with that sometimes it is comic comical for them but when you do something when you do something that is against the enemy when you stand up for what is right they get ecstatic they will yell they will run you know that whole thing about getting inside you running around the house while when you're by yourself they do that because they've been waiting yeah [Applause] in those two running oh god did you see that did you hear what they said [Applause] they've been with you like forever when day you'll ride the rush in heaven with them that's a rollercoaster so yes they will have kind of new lives at one point because there's no more evil you know especially the host I think Gabriel's group is more probable used to just connecting and giving messages and stuff but the hosts all they do is fight they fight the war they fight the war they fight the war they fight the war they fight their war they fight their war they fight they war that's what they do so one day they won't have that they're gonna have fun that's what they're gonna do they'll probably escort us to new planets to explore new planets so good to do exciting things what they'll do and we'll know them right now we need to know God right that's what they want us to do but one day their life will be different and I know we're down here most people in like natural people not were the understanding how things operate they God made them now he made them first but we existed before they did I love these revelations before he made the angels we existed in God that thing about him being from the beginning to the end and the beginning you were in him you saw all that 90 verse 1 through 2 you were with him so he made this statement to me one day because I talked a lot about the angels because I know a lot about them and God said yes they've been with me for a long time I made them a very long time ago in tribes they're all made in tribes the army Gabriel's Lucifer heads and ones he was over so they're not there anymore but there's still some that do worship the Seraphim they still have some that sing in heaven but we actually replace all the worship angels that's why we worship that's why they don't want you to worship the ones the fallen ones they were worship angels who literally would go before the throne of God and worship Him and they chose the one who was their leader who was accreted being over him that's why they cannot repent like they can't repent amen but we existed we always were in him we didn't just appear it's not all of a sudden guy said I want to make billions of little spiritual beings and one day I'll send to the earth they were always we were always in him when there was just Melchizedek and the living creatures and the word and the Holy Spirit before he started making stuff we were there living in and out riding on the rainbow that's where you were everyone who ever existed it came from him eternity is in him that's why he can take you anywhere that's your dad amen so stand up for a minute we're gonna declare something stuff in them god I thank you that your children are here today to hear about you to hear about your plans for them to find out who they are god I pray not one word drops to the ground that was spoken to them God that you will not let it leave their being but they will hear it and hear it over and over and over and over God that they will be empowered and it will be inspired and they will be set on fire to pursue you and your son even more that they will know the Holy Spirit like their best friend because he wants to be thank you god you made a special if we were made in your image than we are special if we're to operate just like you operate that makes this even more special put a burning desire in all of their hearts God to be just like you that was the whole point of Christ donning so he could duplicate himself we are not we will never be God but we are the sons and daughters of God we were loaned to our parents no matter what they were like whether you loved him or didn't want to be with him you were loaned cuz we go home we're all brothers and sisters in the Lord he is your father he is the one you came from he made you in His image people go isn't he just a spirit he has a head he has a body or you would not have one he has arms his legs or you wouldn't have any he doesn't look strange he makes strange things makes a lot of strange creatures in heaven but we don't look strange but we're supposed to live that way Christel live just like him he spoke where there was nothing and then there was he puts power in our words he writes things on our soul before he sends us his hope is that you will come back so don't stop praying for your own safe Amalie your unsaved friends those that work don't stop praying for them declare they will know him love

joy and happiness in this life God that they can demonstrate your image and your character the people in this earth that heaven is not boring God is not boring yes he does love you he does care but he is so holy to even think that when you go home to heaven you had the right to step inside of him that's because he's got and you are his child and he does purpose that Jesus said father you and me and me and you I pray that they will be one even as we are one and he was talking about when you come home to heaven you will step inside the Father Christ will step inside the Father Holy Spirit will step inside the Father and that is one we won't be the three and want to be the foreign one because that is where you came from heaven is like home because that's where he is amen you were born to be great don't let the enemy lie to you she's right he's the father of liars his language is lying so god I thank you for this time together father I I pray that they be empowered that their lives changed forever they will burn with your fire in your love everywhere they go remind them Holy Spirit to release the anointing all the time they can do damage to hell's plans and break yokes off of people because they carry the anointing that your son not just anybody but what your son walked in when they get bored again they get a measure and a deposit of the anointing he walked in they get light from you they get a stone of fire put in their spirit man that brings in light and the more they obey and the more they love that light will become so brilliant they will look like an inferno one day thank you God for truth and life to be and everybody here and if they're not married when they get married let be in their marriage let it be in their children and the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren and then the generations let it build father until you says it's over it's not over so father thank you for tooth in life and celebration today it is a way of life in heaven no

welcome everyone I'm excited about this night how about you how many people were not here last night can I see your hands wow I'm so glad you made it amen how many people this is the first time you've heard me speak how many have heard me on YouTube but not in person how many people never heard me speak before thank you Jesus help them all I was never made to be normal I'm one of 15 I'm number three that means that was a mother at a Jay stop as a helper if you never were part of a big family a tribe you don't understand that if you were you know exactly what I'm talking about you pretty much never had a life that was your life you learned at a young age to surrender you learned how to be in charge you know how to to break up fights to bring peace be adventurous and exciting with the things you have them do to keep them busy so they weren't fighting how to feed that many people how to make that much food i watch that many dishes 150 every day peel 50 pounds of potato once a week eight loads of laundry a day I think we did like 60 a week I helped with all of it and so I learned at early age to hear God for help my baby sister sitting on the front row is number 15 I was like a second mom to her so we grew up knowing each other really well she lives with me has lived with me since 1999 and so has my mom because my dad decided to go home to heaven he's having a wonderful time up there on his ranch with all of our pets it's too late to tell me they don't go there it's the father's choice man there's some things only he decides and if he decides to do who's gonna argue it's too late they're there I recognize many of my pets I had him when I was like 7 you know much before that not a lot but ever since that time although all the pets I've ever had I've recognized all of them and many of my siblings pets they had our brother Joey's duck named Max when he was 9 my brother's alligator named Charlie that lived in our bathtub until it was bath time my brother's iguana lizard named Iggy they've done to the downstairs closet which was also our phone booth you know in the 50s and 60s you had one phone with one line and it was hooked to the wall and sometimes it was a party line that doesn't mean it was a party means you shared everybody's conversation with whoever they were talking to you until they were done unless you could convince them you really needed the phone so I grew up in the time in the era before microwaves at the very beginning of television when you had a round screen it was black and white and had five shows not a lot to watch right we had a big old house we had a big yard and all of our friends wanted to come and visit us so that means we had probably had 30 around 30 all the time in our yard and so we learned how to get along with the rest of the world just because we had to grow up together and my father knew God well the father and the son in the Holy Spirit very well so did his mother some seventh generation of knowing odd living for him loving for him and I love everyone no matter the mistakes you make even what you believe I know where you came from you came from him he had plans for everyone not everyone chose his plans many people don't even know him but he wants to know them so I have a lot of Grace and I have unending patience long-suffering and patience in my life so I can put up with just about anything all the time and God needed me to be that way if I was going to share his home to people all over the world no matter what I would have thought about them I changed I changed several times in my life I got more and more like God because there was supposed to be just like him I actually began to say that there was nothing else to do except say it so I used to stand and say God I want to be just like you now if you loved your father would you say that about him my brothers used to say that about my earthly father I'm gonna be just like you dad I said that about my Heavenly Father I wanna be just like you I'm gonna talk like you I want to act like you want people to see you when they see me I want them to hear you when they hear me and I want to crush darkness and so one day I was just minding my own business which is God's business I was speaking in a church I also speak in many other places anyone who wants to hear about heaven Ellen bite me they have to get past the pink hair whoever knew that that would be a stumbling block right I've been the same and the same as far as my relationship with God since I was age 4 that's a very long time 62 years I've known Jesus Christ personally and so you know I knew he was watching my life all the time I mean he does live in us right he's not blind but he still loves us he has hope for us and he has a lot of hope for us because Christ in us is the hope of so if he lives in you you're not going to escape carrying it and that means one day you'll shine like the stars in the heavens because the word says so so before the one day I was going to tell you about there was another time I was in another city and I think we're out in fairgrounds or something I don't remember we had to go to ladies room there were no lights all the lights had blown out and that was a problem so I went in there to see what was going on when I walked in the door it was this long big room and it was dark until I opened the door and then it was light so I started looking for the light I'm literally looking where's the light coming from I'm not kidding about any of this and where's the light coming from none of the lights are on but everywhere I looked there was light until I looked in the mirror it was coming from me I was stunned but it was it was it was overwhelming to me that I was seeing the word alive in me but when you begin to declare things about God or for God those things are gonna start happening in your life and I would tell people all the time one day you shine like the stars in the heavens because he does let me tell you he shines I'm done my Jesus Christ he's got so much glory coming from you he can dim that glory if he wants to but I've seen him full-out glory like a million diamonds and I used to be so undone whenever I would see him and so I'm a little steam is still staying in the ladies bathroom when there's no light anywhere except coming from me and what this is crazy so I still thought well I know I can see it in the mirror but let's look at all the stalls so I opened every dough every door and there was darkness till I went in then it was light and I walked up and down then it was fun I went up and down everywhere in there and it was light everywhere and I thought if somebody needs to come in here now why the lights by the lights shining right now you can see whatever you need to do and so these were just like I would call them random encounters or instances that happened to me most of my life but that was one that really surprised even me and I heard the Lord say did I not say you would shine like the stars in the heavens that even the night would be light round about you and he was just saying the word to me and he was confirming the word and so if you're faithful to him he's gonna be faithful to you and I know everyone's been through hard times or they have issues in their life or things that they're facing that might not be easy remember who he is and remember who you are okay if you begin to remember who you are according to the word you change the way you look at everything and sometimes nothing seems impossible I've been in a lot of impossible places in my life and it never touched me I made a decision I'm not changing according to circumstances or what people think of what people say oh it is actually happening I don't know what any of it affects me because my hope is in him my eternity is in him no man holds my eternity in their hands it's in his hands and I told people one time when we had absolutely nothing and slept on people's floors that wasn't to teach us something that was to show other something that no matter where you are you can carry the glory you can shift things change things by the decisions you make and the choices you make every day of your life it doesn't stop you from ruling and reigning from Christ it doesn't take away your authority and I told somebody one time they're saying well how are you holding up I want what I'm up what am i holding up what are you talking about well you know all the things you're going through and I'm not going to do anything I'm living my life for Christ's no matter what's going on I will move things I will not let things move me now I begin to declare the goodness of God over my life over my family's life because I knew this was a very short thing in my life I knew it wasn't the devil how about that one it was God showing people that you can live powerfully no matter what's going on around you about the decisions you choose it can change things I didn't change anything I did about my church I still served I helped what I had I would give I love people anyway I was rejoicing every day of my life I chose to be happy and we were saying with the front sweeping on their floors and it was my daughter's a fifth birthday and you know what she was happy about anything could because she had lived for the hottest we trained our children to know God Himself to know who he is what his plans are for us and she just all she wanted was a little baby doll carriage and a baby doll and we couldn't get any of that at the time because things had but something had been taken from us it wasn't us doing it we didn't even curse the person and so there was a sound outside the front door she was awake she ran to the front door and outside was a brand-new with a big bow on it the most beautiful baby doll cares I've seen in my life and the most beautiful baby I've seen full of accessories in this beautiful carriage from someone who knew nothing about what was going on and she ran out saying look my present has arrived the Angels brought us and and so we celebrated her birthday it was awesome the next year before the next year ended someone walked up doesn't said here take this and live here free for a year it was a million dollar condo out at one of the most exclusive places in our city at the beach [Music] we didn't call this person we didn't tell them anything we lived the same way every day if we don't even living in that place because we trusted God we knew he held our future in his hands and I refused to let the enemy have any fun no I tormented him the entire time because all I ever did was have a good report I had a god report of what God was saying about us amen so no matter what it looks like start worshiping him declaring who he is who holds your future in his hand amen because we're entering into powerful times on this earth I've been talking about this for a while but things are literally starting to happen that I said even 12 years ago literally happening exactly the way God told me they would happen and I'm here especially to do two things I'm gonna talk about Trump I hope you like him I hope you realize God does not always choose the one we think is better he chooses the one who is the best for what he needs even my own mom and she was here she came up and give her a test my mom is a hoot she's a be something I forget how old she is all the time she calls people who are 69 old but she never includes herself she travels all over the world with me on no medication she has no help to do anything she's planning to live to be 120 unless God once or longer she'd like to see my dad before them but she understands he's having a good time so she's okay with that but she's very political and has been most of her life because she knows what is right and what is wrong and she has a plumb switch to prove it if you'd ever watch any my when I campaigned this whole last term before Trump was elected I had a lot of Trump reports and my mom wanted to be in as many she could on my facebook she gave her own thoughts and opinions on everything most of the time she had her plumb switch with her people said we need your mom my mom did speak her mind but it was along the lines of what God believed and purpose she knew what life was she knew what death was she didn't have a problem discerning them or telling anyone which one to choose she hasn't changed and she's still my mom even though I'm in my 60s Jen's in her 40s our mom is still our mom and I can probably hear her when she goes to heaven one day giving me her opinions on things she loves this place she loves Pastor Dave and Dee Dee so much she's getting ready for her next month when we go on our british isles cruise she's going to get to for the very first time visit the land of her earthly ancestors which is the irish she's a good example of an irish look I'll tell you why and she's expecting to have a lot of fun amen so she's getting on her treadmill getting in shape picking out her she already got her suitcase packed I think and so she has a lot of fun when she go she will meet a hundred new people who haul them all her friends so she still enjoys her life she starts her own prayer line yeah if people want children if they if they're in a place where they can have babies gate not saying if you can have or not I'm saying if you want them and you're married you're gonna have one if she prays for you we have had other evidence of here right here in this church she pray for them I think it was like nine months later their daughter had a baby and so my mom is serious that she'll start a prayer line at meetings who would like to have babies you must be married because that is coming first and she'll pray for him in every one of them as far as we know every one of them has had a baby that she prayed for him I mean she will she'll make sure you understand what it means to have one cuz if anybody knows it would be her what's gonna happen as the baby gets older this is what you can expect don't be shocked when this happens or this happens it's all gonna be okay all this stuff is normal you just give your life away for about ten years and so she's a lot of fun but my mom put a lot on me my dad put a tremendous amount my mom put a lot of the practical logical things that we need to know how to treat people how to be polite how to be a young lady cuz you never know who you're gonna make sure you always have clean underwear that was always on the list every single day I always do what Jen always wear your seat belt or if you're in the car with her she will put it on you herself and so she does not want people to break the law and she reminds us of it 24 hours a day even if we're not even in other countries I'm down you she's really on top of things so she's a lot of fun my dad was the most amazing person I knew on the earth and I love to talk about him but tonight he wants me to talk about Trump in heaven they're rooting for him I don't know what earth people think about heaven knows that God picked him and what he's already done for this country proves that God picked him amen and he's going to win in 2020 in case you wonder write it down write it down it's going to have and he's only through like two years and he's already created five million jobs if you didn't know I know all the stats I have friends who are part of the Trump administration um I don't know him yet but I will God said I would and I'm you know when whenever that happens is good with me but he's got a lot of things planned he hasn't even talked about yet I'm talking about the president I did just come from the Trump 2020 announcement rally in Orlando Florida it was so deafening you could hardly hear anything from the people they had a hundred thousand tickets but the place only held 20-some thousand people so everybody else was outside they had Jumbotron set up and this is the honest truth no matter what you've heard on the news there were 35 hecklers thirty-five against to the tens of thousands which which came to cheer him on and thank him for what he has done and the thing about the hecklers because I made sure I was outside most of the time on purpose this time I was over there by them releasing the anointing into every one of them they needed help if I was going to be one of them I would have set up my stand I would have given our plan I literally would have said this is our plan for the Democratic Party this is what we got planned it's going to be great they didn't do that all they could do was swear at Trump and swear it people it was really sad so I was praying all the time releasing the anointing sending the host upholding on the demonic off of them I mean I was over here having a prayer warrior time they couldn't scream over the sound of the the jumbo screens they couldn't because I was on the corner like right here's the massive Amway Center that was deafening was like a wave would come from here from the jumbotron that wave would come from here and I was being hit by both waves and I didn't want to make some statements because I'm a seer that means I see the spirit or I'm not like I see everybody's angels here everybody say Thank You angel for putting up with me loving me and watching over me making work as much well I have to tell you what exciting points of me being there and I literally just came from Hollywood from being there for seven days night and day I'm gonna be part of giving content I was sharing this last night I literally um what I said seven years ago what God has said to me I said it happened this last week in Hollywood they're starting up my contract to give spiritual realm content for the resurrection of Jesus Christ movie that's being made in Hollywood in Hollywood so you're gonna see the truth on the screen to the entire movie like Colossians where Christ spoiled and messed up the principalities and powers in the midst of hell ruined their very village forever stripped all the royal robes off of Satan and took the gemstones everyone that God put on him according to Ezekiel 28 you will see him pluck them off one at a time in the movie leaving only the mountings that held them you'll see him take the keys of hell death in the grave why the rush to the all of the hell that was present to watch this show it was a show clearly the word said Christ made a show of it openly so he had a show in hell wasting hell in front of all of Hell okay and you will see that in every detail I can't tell you much more than that but I promise you you will see that in detail while people send up all of a theater and scream for Jesus Christ you'll see the depths of Hell where it took place and the Bible says all through the Bible as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days so we'll be in the earth God had a plan no matter what anyone thought he had a plan when he sent his son and on the day he died which is actually in the garden when he drank the cup you will also see what he drank it won't be a thought in your mind anymore because he died in the garden he died to his own will he said so if it's possible father take this cup from me because he saw what he knew what was in that cup evil the most worst evil ever into his perfectly pure body walking as a man righteous righteous righteous with no sin asked to take that that is what had to be nailed to the cross not just his body that had to go in this perfect body every sin that could be committed had to be nailed to the cross he is the only one who can forgive because he's the only one that drank that cup no one took that inside of themselves and but was nailed to the cross it was what was in him that he had to drink in that garden it was God's will and he couldn't even look upon his son he couldn't hear his father for that time he sets them on the cross so this would be the most different movie you'll ever see in your life it will introduce the spirit realm to all of Hollywood in the whole world [Applause] so yes I am excited because God is taking Hollywood amen you'll see many changes in some of the worst places in our country here because God has always planned to have them for himself Satan has been ruling in these places for a long time so he's very much afraid I will not use the word angry there's a difference in angry and terrified he Satan is terrified he can't stop it cuz Godin has somebody who's never gonna say no who is not afraid of what the enemy might do the enemy is afraid of what I might do does the word say that if you submit yourself under the hand of God you know resisters I mean oh no I'm not taking you I will not tolerate anything you're offering me I'm gonna serve you I serve the Most High God of heaven earth I just polish you I'll never surrender you don't waste your time get out [Applause] well that is how we're supposed to live that as a manifested daughter of God manifesting his power his plans his love his ways his will by the way they live it's not something you do every now and then it is a lifestyle and they're people and God made me take years to get to this point so people would know who I am and what I stand for and even how I live it would be hard for someone to try to bash me because most people wouldn't believe it someone sees me the first time I don't believe you I think you lied about everything why don't you go ask God you cannot hear him because you should if you belong to him the word says you not hear the voice of another if you want truth go ask him and pursue him until you hear it do you give up in two weeks how can you give you something that's gonna take 50 years because some things I've been waiting 50 years for and I will still get it because I'm not giving up and I'm not gonna step back I'll have whatever he wants to give me and you should be saying the same thing so Hollywood is going to be wrecked by the Most High God by the hosts of heaven I've been bombarding Hollywood since I left they're sending in sweeps of that place ten billion hosts of heaven to pull down every stronghold of Satan every realm any high level being has been ruling from there being shredded the ones that can't will have their mouth shut while I'm there because I don't have to tolerate them God didn't did he his son didn't did he are we supposed to be just like them we made in their image and after their likeness which means the way they operate were supposed to operate so when the body finally gets that message and they wake up stand up and stand out you'll see many powerful changes and shifts happens in this world there are 10 year-olds right now commanding an army of the hosts of heaven and they've been doing it for three years they wreak havoc on hell the enemy runs from them this is who we are we're not weak little humans we may live in this world but you are not you are an alien you're from another world and God is serious about us living on earth as they live in heaven so this time for America is a great time it will set things up for many years to come 24 years of God in the White House will happen [Music] [Applause] so you can expect Trump to win in 2020 and then pence win for the next eight years after that and whoever pence picks his vice-president will be president for eight years eight years after that twenty four years in the White House maybe the Democrats should take a long vacation and wait it out I'm trying to help them it is sound advice you can only talk like this if you've seen God face to face and he told you that except he doesn't just tell me he shows me when Trump said he was winning God showed me took me in Fisher and showed me Trump sitting in the White House when there's still 17 people in the Republican group running against him God said I will eliminate them one by one they'll be forced to take him because even the leaders didn't want him because they couldn't control him they couldn't scare him they couldn't buy him God picked the right person so I know I don't know who Pence is going to pick but they will seriously consider it they've already heard me declare all this on the inaugural prayer breakfast when they let me do the prayer or Trump and pence I prophesied so I'm looking forward to these years in my life don't miss them don't sit on a rock somewhere and just watch it go by be a part of it because once you step out and start doing something it just accelerates your faith explodes when you begin to see God do things quickly because we're in a time of acceleration it will be quickly we still have years left I don't always tell how many years left I don't know the date in time I know the event like at one point there'll be I'm talking about when there's no more time on the earth I'm not talking about just the millennial reign time not past that because it's during them alone and ring you know that's a thousand years right how many people know that been to Israel been to the temple I know that Christ will sit on a throne for 1,000 years in that place when no one is destroying Israel if you've wondered about that don't be concerned about it keep praying for them God is blessing them the desert is blooming like it never has before I was there five years ago it was all desert when I came this time because I was also there for like I forgot how many days it seemed like eternity I didn't get to speak in a nice hotel I actually had viewed the pilgrim his tour where you went to Masada and every place Jesus went then other you know Elijah you know I'm not Carmel I was there I was in the garden tomb where the two angels who rolled the stone away are still there I stood in the garden flower bed where Christ did that's why Mary thought he was the gardener he likes flowers I've been in the upper room I spoke on the Sea of Galilee I was in Shiloh where Joshua led the people into the Promised Land that's where they first settled I was there I saw every spiritual spirit round the thing that had been opened by all these mighty men and women of God and I think the thing that moved me the most was you could hold a Bible and stand not quite but it seemed I can see from one end Israel to the other it's not very big but everything in the Bible happened in that small area and they have kept those places they've kept them and they like Americans but Israel loves Trump they love him because in the short amount of time what he was able to do for that country that's never been done before it was actually promised by many presidents in our country but they never did it he did it and they all loved him it doesn't matter how old they are doesn't matter if they're Orthodox or you know messianic or secular Jews it doesn't matter they all love him because he's made their country safer he's finally announced it is literally a real country amen it had the right to that land they got the Golan Heights back you've got to go everywhere in this country because Americans are welcome by anybody a general matter if it's Palestinians it doesn't matter who it is Syrians if they live in that country they kind of separate up the land is real smart they don't have as much war because they sat down and talked to these people well they own all the land the Palestinians aren't but they made an agreement we'll let you live there but you'll pay taxes instead of having awards that will keep fighting what we all live our lives so they don't go in their area without permission but everybody gets along and so all these different sections I think is like ABC cently they came up with a plan I was amazed at the plan but but the American tourists can go to any part of Israel they want to because those people know they're gonna make money so they welcome tourists all the time it's like they won't let an Israeli bus driver go into one area but they'll let a bus driver from that area pick up the Americans and bring them in that area and so that's why there's not as much war also the threat that Trump said if you attack them you're attacking me in my country I think that helps a little bit God purpose for them to be friends and this is a season of destiny for Israel it's a season of destiny for Korea for England amen of course for America and Hollywood for priority things got his pinpointed to start something between 2018 and then the 2019 major things would happen in each one of those places it was set of course for their destiny and God made sure I got to go to each one of those places and declare something for him and Korea was the first one at the end of the right at the end of the games I was invited to speak to a university isn't that amazing with my twelfth grade education see my graduation certificate they wanted me to come teaching about heaven and give college credits for it and they all did very well that was quite interesting I lost 12 pounds because I don't like fish guess what they ate every day of their life I had pretzels Brazil nuts and oranges that's what I ate for 12 days and in Israel it was almost the same I didn't like their food either guess what they eat a lot of fish the whole hotel smelled like fish so I ate like tomatoes a roll I again had some kind of nuts I think it was almonds or something I ate almonds and every now and then I have some little dessert thing that was about it so I lost 12 pounds there also if you go to Israel make sure you're in pretty good shape because you will climb up everything steps made out of stone steps that go forever and then you're gonna come back down there's no trolley car to take down okay you walk up these steps down these steps up these mountains down these mountains sometimes inside the mountains but you walk you're gonna walk those people walk no wonder they're all in good shape don't ride a camel don't walk by mine either my heart went out to the wise men as they crossed the desert for to hurt each with a bunch of camels it wasn't three camels with three why's my whole life I thought while they had a long journey together there must have got each other know each other really well right it's just a three of them no they each had lines of camels and they carried their tents their food their food for the camels their water their servants their homes they carried everything with the smelly camels and thinking I have a whole new view of being on that camera so some of it was funny most of it was very powerful as I got to meet some really amazing Jewish people they took us into the Jewish quarter we had a really great tour guide his name is Yoshi if you ever plan to go there look him up they call him the unofficial mayor of tourism he also he's in his 70s he's been I forgot three different digs actually where the unearthed stuff and everything he knows a lot about that takes you into the old Roman places before Christ was even born and you see a lot learn a lot but the thing that you never get over is the presence of God there and you're so impacted by you realize how they live their lives and yet they have survived survived survived and they have outlived all of their enemies which they are very pleased with and they'll always make the statement no matter what went on they're gone and we are still here so God does have amazing plans he really does have priority list he's working on and he's going to complete his priority list it's important to pray always pray never stop praying make sure you declare and decree also it is a high level of praying and when we pray many times we're asking which is good because you don't have it right if you don't ask you have not because you ask not asking comes in a form of the prayer reviews to be been doing on most of our lives declaring and occurring is another level of Prayer where you have so much faith in you you know what you say is going to happen because you know the word what the word says and your faith grows as you step out and believe and trust God more and do things you you become soulful of God and you understand the word come so alive to you because you're living it you're not just reading you're living it and so God does have a timeline in heaven I was shown that timeline up into heaven so many times I lost count I stopped counting but I remember every time I've been he has a timeline behind his throne and I've seen part of that timeline and there's still a lot left that hasn't happened and every one of those things I saw was not like a date it wasn't like March 2nd 2019 it was the name of the event that was going to take place and there's still things we haven't done that the word talks about so I know there are people literally writing books and sharing from their platform it's called all gonna end well they've been saying that a long time the Mayans lost out they had their last chance they're all dead and gone and we're still here so the Mayans timeline that's gone that was actually written down and people said well we don't have much time left I want I'll still be here and it'll all be gone I'm not going anywhere yeah and so God has his timeline and there are events we're living in one of those events right now that he calls the kingdom age and in this timeframe of this kingdom age which is several generations of time it is it is going to not end into the Millennial age starts amen or right before the Millennial age possibly I don't know when that's going to end or happen either I just know it's not for right now the perros times are not for right now this is the day of his power or not the day of his wrath the most important thing you can learn about God is what time is it that's why the tribe of Judah wouldn't do anything without consulting the tribe of Issachar who knew the times and seasons of God how to operate in it what you needed to operate in it what you needed to do to be successful in it and the manifested sons and daughters will operate just like the tribe of Issachar in this time they will know what time it is on God's timeline and how to live the way you need to to be successful so living on earth as it doesn't happen is very important to know that and to actually live it to believe in God let your faith explode in him be prepared to celebrate not to escape forget escaping I love it I love it the father says you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape being great that's what he thinks about this time it's a time to be great for him great with him amen even you don't understand anything I'm saying trust me it's not over how about that one so roll of your rapture rug don't worry about escaping because the rapture won't be an escape it will be a celebration so even that's not going to be what most people think we have to escape we have to we have to escape the mark of the beast I don't think he's on the earth yet you know why he won't be able to do much because in this time we get stronger and greater with God we manifest the power of the Living God and do you think so shocking that it will stun he'll push darkness back and shift this world and change things the enterprise couldn't be here it says clear in the world until he that is withheld is removed the Antichrist cannot appear and we're just finding out who we are so forget about the rest of stuff that is in the father's hands jesus said to occupy until he comes back not high we also get to put the third show on God put the first one on kicking Satan out of heaven with all of his fallen angels who were angry and bitter at their newfound leader who lied to them the first thing he said to him was a lie everything after that has been a lie he even lied them when Christ's went into hell remember because he had to he was telling he's gonna wipe up hell with him get ready we're gonna have a show oh I'm putting on the biggest show he said well wipe him up and people are gonna know fine you once and for all I have more power I have more authority this is my heir my area my realm my role here and no one's going to come in here and tell me what to do and yet he beat him up how many people saw the Avengers and saw the Hulk take Loki Beibei Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam pretty much that's what's gonna happen in the movie I love what Jeff says Iron Man shows up first in Jesus this is not this is a this is a fictional account okay taking some license in this because Jesus did melt the faces of the principalities they melted like laughs so there's an Iron Man to the leader of all these that he had taken so much time to call in because principalities don't sit in hell if you understood how hell operated you would understand how much that scripture what that means in that scripture when it says the principalities and powers he wasted them and spoiled them well they wouldn't even be in Hell normally they rule on Thrones around this world because Satan was gonna have a big show he called them all in all that word went everywhere call him in call him in I want him to watch put him on the front row at the gates of Hell right inside the court yard they're gonna see me man all stoked I'm a book at my royal robes on no he's no shine his stones that at that time he still had I got a shine on so they you know they glow let me fell because of his duty he's about to lose it all he had the keys I'm in charge of death this was him he actually said these words he bragged about it on purpose so here comes all the hierarchy all the little demons have to be way in the back screaming and complaining whining why they'd be guys coming here they all hate each other by the way there's no love and Satan's care so he's gonna have a good show and all this time Christ is saying nothing just waiting for his father to say something or hear something third day lightning bolt hits hell Brett when the show is gonna start you know in order to have a show you have to have lights you got to have action you have drama you have a lot of noise and somebody recording it all oh don't forget the audience got to have the audience so Satan had all planned out from his master table or he had planned all this out right figured God didn't come the first day God wasn't didn't know where he was he went smart enough didn't come the second day he was afraid he wasn't strong enough so now we're moving him from the back of Hell up here we're gonna plan a show that did not happen not the way they planned so when that happened there was a little shudder in hell they remember the lightning bolt that's what took him out of heaven that was the father's only thing he had to do with the whole show it was his sons stands up and the fire of God comes out of his hands it begins to melt one by one the little guys in the back row were really GAD they weren't they were glad they weren't on the front row there's a big opening towards the back of Hell from the courtyard they were trying to cram themselves they were running so fast screaming trying to get away from the Son of God melt everything literally running down this this darkened tunnel they were screaming and jumping running on top of each other they didn't care the principalities were getting the front row and then he melts half the faces of all them some of them managed to get away when I was a little girl I would see them when I went into my places I see these demons their heads were like this big there was this thick their eye sockets were melted their mouths were disfigured and melted and I was standing there and go I wonder what happened to them what what happened to them I don't think hell can melt their own demons I mean I didn't really know until I was taken back in time and I was shown it now I understand completely I don't know why you're chiming this God but I'm enjoying every moment of it until I got the call from the producer saying I'm gonna make a resurrection movie want me to give me spiritual content and trust me they want it in the movie he is not afraid of what any man's gonna say he's waiting 15 years to do this film and he doesn't care he's a businessman okay it says easier to work with business people than religious people because if it doesn't line up with everybody's doctrine they don't want it and they'll crucify you if you put it in there and they said no don't put it in there he's ignoring every one of them I've waited 15 years to do this movie I'm doing it God's way I want my god wants and I don't care what anybody says amen so I'm very excited about this whole thing because the world will finally know Jesus Christ is the son of God not good so God informed me several years ago that I'm gonna put a third show on but I won't be doing it you will it's for the sons and daughters that's why the earth cries out for them to stand up and do something he said I did the first show my son the second show you all get to do the third one lights action drama lots of yelling raising the dead that were cremated I'm serious but if you go to a funeral and he says get up there and take the lid off that John you command that spirit to come back in that body are you going to do it you should say that very loudly because trust me if he says that to you you are gonna know it is the Son of God you're not in your head gonna even have there's no time to even argue with that when he says something you get so empowered you're like sure take the lid off the jar I command your spirit to come back into that body in Jesus name and all the ashes come out like a whirlwind and there's the person that is part of the third show-stopping earthquakes and then telling them put it back the way it was before they happen we are over the earth we are over the ocean we over all of the atmosphere over every creature on this earth we have a Thornton dominion over them we're just finally going to demonstrate it so don't ask me where's that in the word I just told you it's Genesis 1:26 and in Romans what talks about the manifested sons or daughters that is you don't wait for some great name person to come stand somewhere and do it cuz stuffs gonna happen everywhere and who's gonna do something about it we are with Jesus Christ don't think I'm too old you don't care for ninety nine or nine if he picked you he picked you and you sit in your seats all you want to say I don't want to do that it won't work he has this wonderful powerful way about himself to influence you and convince you especially if he comes in person you're gonna go and you're gonna think you're gonna melt into the ground when those eyes that blaze with passion for you look in you and say but I need you to do this you're gonna run over top of everybody you know you're not gonna care what one person says you're not gonna be very quiet by the way practice yelling people go on quiet you won't be quiet on that day I was a person who never spoke I was happy never speaking to anybody I think I spoke to two kids people in high school I wasn't trying to be a part of anything care at a tribe they spoke all the time I didn't need to hear someone else talking I was the person who never of us the wallflower the one who never wanted to say anything I didn't want to hug people I had enough people hugging me at home I didn't want to hug people I cared about him you know god help him I did help them my dad did so I helped my help my dad helped people but still I was a person who never wanted to be known I would have never had pink hair on my head I like my long blonde hair I didn't ask for pink hair Jesus Christ came in person sat on my loveseat at 4 a.m. put his arm around me so I thought my body was gonna melt into his it began to tell me what my destiny was this is after they've been taking me to heaven since 1996 now he tells me the other side of the story and then he hooks him he goes and we need you to have pink highlights in your hair I didn't dare voice anything who was gonna tell the Lord of glory I don't want to do that and then in my head I'm thinking why you know why my daughter's gonna get married in two months the in-laws already think I'm strange all over takers walk down the aisle with pink he knows every thought you're thinking and he looks at me and pleases are on your toes because it is absolutely necessary that when the world sees you and they hear you and they know you know us but you love and you have pink hair you're never going to judge them they'll listen to anything you say we need that pink hair is heaven's marketing plan I'm sure there's not a pastor on this earth that ever thought God would use pink hair as a marketing plan I've met some of them for four years I served so many pastors of different events in my city love them they knew me so well but I had gone over the deep end when I had pink hair put on my head I want y'all y'all need to get more of the Spirit in you because you could too son you know know me by the spirit not the not the flesh right it's a flesh test and just get ready for you ask you to have green hair I wouldn't encourage you to go get it because he has a purpose for it and I've been trying to explain ever since I've had this since 2006 I've had pink hair I've won more people to Lord then I had my entire life before that it works just stand somewhere if you're over fifty someone's gonna come and ask you what is that well on Heaven's ambassadora they have hair like this in heaven and then I start talking about the things they like cuz Jesus is telling me the Holy Spirit is telling me the whole time I'm stinging in front of them talk about the talk about the extreme sports in heaven I was talking to two teenage girls on the beach I think Jen was there yeah they had skateboards with them but you know a skateboard a skateboard right so I start talking about extreme sports in heaven where you don't even need a helmet you do 100-foot jumps and your skateboards got fire coming out of it and they drop their skateboards dock 14 what are you talking about I was told there wasn't a god oh no I've met him I been to his home called heaven and you would not believe the things I have there and did you know he made you and did you know you lived in him before you came here they don't care about any doctrine they've only heard God hates them because they're sinners they've only been told about Hell not God so I talked to them for 40 minutes they're so filled so excited about God do you want to know where they could go they went to give yourself to him they want to know where can I go that I can hear this stuff I said well I don't know how many places are here yet but the church I go to they do teach about heaven that there is a heaven did you teach you how to live your life set your blessing him helping people that's the way you talk to people you're not you're not accusing them of anything I talk to them like they know him and that's what God said talk to them like they already know us then they're interested so in this time learn how to talk to people and you know what the angel standing around you they're gonna help keep you protect you especially if you command an army from heaven that might be new to you too don't be afraid by that we are over the Angels is that true everybody are we gonna judge them and they succumb well you can't judge somebody that you're under you need to start thinking about what the Bible says about you make a list stand in front of a mirror and say it every day I did that I did it all the time and one day Jesus walked in my wall and the wall of my home and he keeps walking in there all the time it's not impossible for you to go to heaven and see heaven it's quite wonderful but I'm not ready to go over there I know people go the cry when they have to leave I don't cry because I'm not gonna leave here without fulfilling everything he wants me to do and that is to help campaign for this coming election I'll have I have a new studio I'm gonna have a broadcast at least once a week jump on the Trump 2020 train give reports from heaven the whole time but God is saying and then you see things happen through the whole election God has a plan for this country to make it a pattern for other countries leaders to one after we just have to love those that don't understand or don't like it but their lives even their lives are better than they were before even they are benefiting I know people who blasted and yelled and hollered and yet they're small businessmen they get 25percent reduction on their taxes and they don't say no they're gonna vote for him this time because something actually happened during someone's term that did something to help them amen everybody stand up we're gonna declare something you don't have to but you can and then we're gonna have some Q&A time it's hard if I have a Q&A if I start with cueing any time I never want to stop it's hard to stop so I can stop what I'm talking about so we can have some because people have questions and it's my London or my favorite things to do is to answer people's questions if I know I'll answer if I don't I just say I don't know amen so we're going to clear something say father I am your child I want your will your way in my life and for this earth so I declare the upcoming election in 2020 the one you have chosen will win in a landslide you will show your favor over that administration and give them new things to do to help our country be greater than it ever was before and God because I care I pray for the other side the blinders we've taken off the rise they will stop hating they will start loving that they will benefit from this whole thing because this is your plan and we want your man so help the others God because we're running our race your will your way hallelujah [Applause] we need to shout on that everybody [Applause] we're we need more in the body of Christ like cat that lays it down I mean 24 years because she's heard God and she's not ashamed to proclaim what God has told her regardless of the persecution she takes and I know she doesn't say but it's got to be something else on Facebook and different things and quotes and things that people say and she is dedicated committed to her God and so as we go into the question and answers we want to take an offering for her and pass offering the offering baskets for her while we're doing this because this is a fun time so go ahead and have a seat and pastor Brooke if you and Renato could take these mics so that we can get every question on it so our streamers can hear the questions oh she's awesome so she doesn't have to repeat it up here and father we just thank you once again Lord God for this ministry and this and this marketplace ministry that's out there father and it's a business Lord God you have all of that wrapped up in in this precious one called Kat and Lord we thank you for her obedience to do what you called her to do and it empowers us Lord David and I as you know we have been empowered in these last two nights we've been empowered with a new boldness if that's possible I don't know what we're gonna be like but father God we are going into an upgrade we are all upgrading so Lord we want a blessed camp we want to bless this ministry we wanted to go out to the outermost parts of the earth and Lord she doesn't even need this money because she's got you we need to give and we need to support and we need to deposit because Lord were sowing so that we can then benefit within ourselves Lord God's so that we upgrade so we can be these fiery lions and lionesses out there roaring so Lord we just thank you for leading and guiding our giving tonight in Jesus name okay tell us tell us how to get we get so people don't know some people understand this and this is what we're gonna do this is the order we're gonna do on this side on this side and on this side we're gonna rotate back and forth we're not oh you'll be on this side pastor Brooke on this side and what you do you'll take your questions we'll have the questions come up on this side or this side and ask the questions here so we can have the mics so then it'll be clear for the cameras too so awesome and so you can give online at WWE or on your mobile phone text go mz2 seven seven nine seven seven and you'll seek a career there or you can give cash or check now the questions I want to say just a couple of words about the questions some people think they don't have one until they hear the first one the answer and then everybody has questions and I'm a detail person that's why God picked me so most questions have a lot of detail to them so and you're gonna love every one of them it doesn't matter you're going to learn from this Q&A session but try to keep it to questions about heaven itself about the spirit realm activities or about the time we're living in right now because some people go into it's not it's easy to answer a personal question about yourself because most of the stuff he gives me is for the corporate body of Christ so it should be something that everyone here would be interested in I wanted to know the answer to it makes it much easier for me because if I answered everybody's personal question we would literally be here all night long so try to keep it to something and just one question okay somebody showed up one time they had 115 questions on the lid I heard from a prophet a long time ago that you are a wise person if a prophet is coming and you want a question you write it down and hand it to that prophet put your phone number on it or your email and eventually you'll hear something back but if you come unprepared then you're gonna go over with whatever God gave them to share when you missed your chance to ask something that you want to know so always come prepared okay and any of the questions if you don't get to come up here and speak in them write it on a piece of paper and leave it at the products table with your first name and your age and where you're from because I am literally looking for a lot of new questions for book three and we're gonna change out all the ones that are on our website so we're always looking for new questions so it's not going to be lost okay so let's just get the first question when the father asks us to resurrect the ashes can it be a person this would be somebody who just recently died yeah you're not learning upbringing they're not coming anyway somebody been dead it's been 10 years you think they're gonna leave heaven look I know you've walked on truly Europe they're a part of your lives but if you could go there and see how they were living you wouldn't ask them to come back just be prepared when you go and you know what's gonna happen to get there then no wonder they didn't want to come back down here in their old bodies so it would normally this would be somebody who just died like at a funeral and you were at the funeral something like that unless one thing so this is help this is what happens I was shown in the future and the entire plane crashes everybody's burn up in the plane like to ashes and a believer goes in resurrects everybody up that burned up in the plane they all come back to life they get their bodies back they even have their clothes on that is something that will be that will happen that's like a greater work or Manifest asunder so that could be something like that but it's usually something that just happened okay so I know that the Lord promotes us on earth as we're faithful right so are we going to be continued to be promoted when we're in heaven into eternity well God I think everybody heard that question I kind of say it a god promotes us on the earth and it says that he's the one who lifts up and puts down we know he does that and sometimes even unexpected people unknown people he does that and he's certainly gonna do that a lot like over the next 20-30 years you're gonna see that happen a lot down here God has his ways to reward you when you get to heaven and you cannot say no to that reward that reward you'll never forget for the rest of your existence and that is the main way God rewards you in heaven for all you've done on the earth for him even things you didn't even think he was aware of but he doesn't stop rewarding you so it's not so much like you have to be promoted in heaven you're already promoted because you move there the gift he put in you people will run to see you use that gift so you in a way your whole life changes whatever your passion is he putting you to do with your natural gift he prepares everything in heaven for you to use that gift so a lot of people going to come they're going to celebrate who you are they're gonna love it so that way is a non-stop promoting of you because of the way he designed heaven so you're gonna love it you're gonna just love it Kat has the Lord shown you much about the destiny of New York and Connecticut I'd like to know better how to pray and I am from those areas originally I do know that New York is going to become a region of light in this country yes because of and he even explained vine because they were willing to open their borders to bring all the unwanted the ones coming to find rescue New York was very unique for God's purpose for it and they fulfilled that purpose that many purpose he had was for them to welcome them in people came from all over the world set up their own settlements and then because some of them became very great people they went to other places but New York was like a birthing place for people for their destinies for their gifts and God is planning to honor that it will become a region of light where one point there'll be no crime no sin and no sickness and I was I was born in New York so I also know that I left heaven and was sent to New York New York Yankee sent all the way to the deep south I promised to tell people that okay if you come to floor don't worry about being carried off by an alligator you probably will never even see an alligator they don't roam they're not like the Buffalo they have to stay in the water or their hide will fall off the only time you see an amount of the water is crossing the road to go to another body of water their height is about this thick and the dinosaurs even we see how these questions go the dinosaurs on the earth when it was made the first time they could not have survived on the earth like it is now because those dinosaurs had to stay in continual mist and water so the atmosphere was like a continual mist the sky was a peachy pink the Sun wasn't there he lit the original earth with his glory and they did wrong with watch her angels that's why they find footprints it's not a human footprint it's a watcher angel they hadn't flesh on them there is a history lesson go ahead what's the next question first of all I want to say thank you for being the gift and the wrap the Revelator day you are so we love you and the other one is without giving too much away when you us to expect your next book and King without giving all of it away what to expect in the next book I am working on the next book but God has a timeline for that and he says the movie has to come first because it'll take one-third of my life every year to work in the movie in Hollywood on the movie and I have to be honest I have to be then when they do anything because of the spirit realm they've never seen it so even though we give them sketches and drawings they're not quite sure the activity or the words that were spoken at that time what does the atmosphere feel like so they have creators who are going to work on all the spirit realm stuff I have to be present when that's done as you present when they actually create the sets I have to be present when they do the filming and so I'll probably get the weekends off and that's going to take 18 months just when they get to that part so I'll be working on an off on book 3 it will be 3 times bigger then it'll be the last one called revealing heaven number 3 so he started a relationship with you in heaven in book 1 and book two increases in every level it shows you more of what's in heaven book 3 is going to show things that will shock you and stun you that's in heaven it'll it'll have a picture of a human soul I can tell you that literally how he made your soul how it operates will be in the book even the scene from the third day in hell I can tell you that will be when the illustrations I have 25 illustrations I'm working on I always do those first and then he gives me the chapter titles of what to write about because I know so much about it it's going to be stunning i opening and you will celebrate a lot when you see the things that are that are going to be in that third book they'll even be prophecy at the end about the future and even some scenes from the future like one of the planets that will be created when the new earth is made so it's gonna be pretty cool since we are part of the putting on the third show like the X power 'full first show and second show can you tell us anything about that that you might know and one other thing anything about John F Kennedy jr. um I have not seen John F Kennedy jr. in heaven that doesn't mean he's not there heaven is bigger than our whole galaxy it's a plan it's a world it's not a flat place and almost every picture I've seen of heaven all they can draw as the throne room they don't know they know there's a throne room there so you see a picture of the throne room right and usually the father and the son are on the back wall and there's like a mass of millions of people I can tell you not like that the throne-room is in the middle the throne is in the middle of the throne room and there's four sets of steps that go up there so everybody can run up and see them whenever they want to so that part needs a little correction because he's not on the back wall away from everybody the throne room expands because it's alive he can hold as many people as he wants to I can just tell you the third show would be one of the greatest of all because it's what God has purpose went from the time we lived in him and he sent us and took our little spirit man and knit it together in her mother's womb with our flesh body we can't make a spirit man people we can't make anything that has made out of spiritual content we just can't that's God's only God can do that part so there is no life until the spirit is attached to that data flesh and we will see so many powerful things some of the things I've been talking about even tonight will be part of that third show but one of the things I don't talk a lot about is the presence of the glory the presence of the glory will be so powerful most people don't know what the glory is they know it's probably going to be beautiful it's going to be amazing it literally is like carrying the life of God yourself and in operating at sometimes without measure everyone has a measure the work talks about us operating in a measure god gives those measures but some of the manifests the sons of daughters who will be everyday people will operate when they're operating it'll be like without measure the power be so tremendous that sometimes it will impact an entire state when something is demonstrated or done sometimes it will impact an entire country what will happen I know the Dead will be raised in mass like thousands at one time by one person and so these are some of the things and this is part of the third show it won't be one day it's not going to be like you know in hell on the third day that was a day and heaven it wasn't just a de space-time there's no time in heaven but it it wasn't something he could do if there was time you think about one third of the Angels he kicked out along with their leader that probably if there was time would have been a while along enough for them to have a big party going on the whole time and pretty sure that happened because they were all happy he was kicked out they you think about it heaven was holy it was pure it was undefiled they all loved one another they work together you know like brothers did God made tribes of angels for very specific purposes they all knew their own purpose they were happy about why he made them to do the Army was there they had no enemy to fight there was no enemy but God had made an army for the specific person purpose of fighting against the dark army there was no dark army until Lucifer decided to take over they knew who their enemies would be from that point on and so I just can tell you this that the show is going to be tremendous it will be ongoing probably for several generations which will also shift the way all of our lives will begin to operate for several generations after that and I know people have a timeline for the rapture nobody knows that day except the father and he's the one saying this stuff okay he showed me the next fifty years of my life that doesn't mean it's my last assignment I just know exactly what I'll be doing for the next 50 years what platforms I'll be operating for him and I'm telling you I just started the fifty year or so so I can guarantee you I know it's even beyond that time and because it doesn't end until God says it ends amen and even that I think the probably the last big show will be the marriage supper of the Lamb I've also been shown parts of that it's going to be beyond anything you ever imagined it only gets better with God you don't lose it's worth anything to be a part of him and what he wants it's not worth anything to help hell hell doesn't celebrate anybody they take the worst people who sold their self literally met the Satan so that really does happen - and lies to them like he did I mean he did that in heaven right he did that on the earth even tried to attempt Jesus to do that he's never changes them all and so he does get people to do all kinds of horrific things and he promises them with lies I'll give you power Authority I'll give you part of my kingdom you'll rule with me he tortures them worse than anyone else and makes a show of it himself in hell he hates them worse than anybody they get nothing they get worse done to him done to them than anyone else who just rejected tries it's only worse and bad for them okay so he didn't love anyone don't help him don't advertise for him it's about time we start advertising about the glory God and the goodness of the earth and the good things that are happening all over this earth because I don't think the fake news understand that or they don't know about it but there are powerful things happening right now in this earth that God is in charge of that are happening about people loving one another countries helping each other and you never see that that's gonna change okay next question I always imagined heaven as being the sort of place where everybody can fly around and have SuperSpeed and stuff so like during the kingdom age does that mean people will be able to do that here I would say since we're all saying on earth as it is in heaven I have to see some of that happening here and I'm sure at different times if you need you - why wouldn't you fly I mean why wouldn't you he transported Phillip through the sky on a chariot he's not the only one he did that to either so why not because yes to do fly in heaven I was take a new place and this is C this is what rocks people is not the fact that tell me flying heaven is who teaches you to do that in heaven that the religious minded I get they almost like gnash their teeth when I tell them things like this because they can't see in their head happening I was taken to a place in heaven that was this massive amusement park it's in my first book it really exists I've been there several times since then it has the impossible impossible impossible things happening that you have so much fun with doing and this is the thing if somebody receive Jesus Christ as their Savior as they were dying they will be in heaven and they will still use the gift God sent them as so if you sent them doing wonderful fun things they have movies in heaven no defilement no profane language no sexuality no graphic violence forget it you could there's no ratings they don't need them but heaven makes ratings for our movies down here our is rotten [Laughter] pg13 partly good 13 percent PG partly good G mostly good so remember that when you go to watch a movie Superman teaches you how to fly huh Christopher Reeves Christopher Reeves teaches you to fly you think about the humor and all that because they have a place where you actually learn you don't just jump up and do it there's things you have to learn in heaven there's things just given to you and you do it but he wants you to discover things I mean he's our Father like you want your kids to discover things and then you do them how wonderful does that make you feel well it's no different in heaven so they have a place in heaven where you can go and they have stands for all your friends and family to come watch you learn to fly it doesn't work out the first time there's more laughter in heaven than anything in this earth and people invite their friends on purpose to learn because they know they're gonna have a mini show right there so everybody's friends and family are waiting because they've already learned right they can just dream they have the beginners area god smart you could hit each other and weren't hurt but why right so they have the beginners area where you learn basic instructions on flying then you have the intermediate area then you have whatever you want to go in heaven so this is the basic every time where the beginners learn and most of them get out there and they try to fly this is one thing I've seen them doing they're trying to fly across the air that doesn't work sometimes they look like they're rowing a boat I don't know what they're doing and some of them just throw their selves out there and they spin spin spin spin spin spin spin spin but your instructor will stop you in eventually you learn no this is very distance it's just like right just right you better learn to laugh there's a lot to laugh and sometimes it's you but yes you will fly in heaven so why not down here you never know what he's gonna do with you I walked on there I didn't expect that I've been talking about it I stepped right off and just kept walking and so I was just doing what was normal and it became super naturally heaven normal so what's the next question so I have a lot of visions of the kingdom of God and a lot of it's similar I'm walking up step Jesus gives me the keys and opened the door and I see a lot of rooms I see a lot of items he wants me to take does that actually change this 3d realm I mean what's the point in all that we're talking about why you're on the earth you're talking about why you're in heaven if I see the kingdom of God and I have a vision and the in Jesus gives me something what's on point to that there's a point to and I'm sure he's got a point I'd always know the point but it's the same thing that how he operates with me he'll show me something and it might be years later and then I do it that doesn't mean he's not going to let you do it because he has timing for everything he has times he reveals things that's what he's doing then there's times he activates it was something you do or an event that's gonna happen he will activate it and then you will actually do it and there will be there are places built on this earth in spiritual areas where because of what we're doing in who we are in this time we will have access to those places and do things and that's probably what he was showing you that was awesome I just want to thank you first of all for supporting our great president because the fake news lies about him all the time and I thank you for doing that and also I want to also thank you that in 2009 my husband and I lost our youngest son to an accident you came here a few months later for your first time here in 2010 mm-hmm and you you actually said a portal opened up above the ceiling here and you you described him you saw him hanging by his legs off the porch yeah I want to thank you for that because what's his name Luke yes it was and the for him and the first time I heard you speak before you said that I was you know my flesh was like what is she talking about I mean of course I believed in heaven but we believe for his bodily resurrection here and it happened and I know you said just a while ago that that would not happen because he doesn't want to come back you're not as much as he loves you this is how they feel in heaven they don't they don't feel like I stay have no sorrow they have no grief there isn't any in heaven they celebrate knowing one day you're going to be there with them and their whole focus is you being there and to them it's not like 10 years have gone by they don't even think timewise like like we would on the earth so all I can tell you is he still feels the same way he's still having an awesome time and he is watching this meeting and my question for you is as far as I know you spoke about atheism last night you said that all people have got in them he put that in them and my father is an atheist I've been praying for him for 20 years and my question is can I command the host of heaven to go and save him because I just spoke to him on Father's Day and nothing's changed don't go Bible and anything you're hearing or seeing do not go by what the evidence is in the natural you have to believe what God's Word promises you okay he promises you he says if you believe in something say and you do not doubt in your heart you shall have what whatsoever you say so don't change what you're saying don't change it okay that's the best thing closure I can give you okay this is the question I've been wanting to ask you for a while in heaven there's no sin and so this scripture has kind of puzzled me where it says if you don't forgive neither will you be forgiven and so if you're a Christian and there's somebody you hadn't forgiven how does that work there's a big difference in being angry and upset and for unforgiveness consuming you unforgiveness is like a spirit to consumes you just being angry and upset for somebody and you don't want to say you know it's okay there's a big difference God is the only one who can judge that he's not turning people away because they had a reason to be angry or upset and you don't want to speak to somebody or if you think about him you it hurt you inside it's more you losing stuff from your soul loose all that all the trauma whatever you experience from them whatever they said you did you need to lose that from your soul and the reason for that is you won't think about it no more because sometimes we're hurting worse holding back from something then the person who actually did something to us and let me tell you if they make it to heaven they will not remember that people don't remember those things when they get to heaven they love you no matter who you are and they don't want anyone suffering over something they caused to happen on or something someone on the earth did to them because that is what Satan will do he will take whatever caused you to feel that way and he will ram it down you everyday and he will make that that that block longer and bigger he'll cause that division between you to be stronger if you let him do that so God says look at what's happening to you and deal with that first because when that's dealt with you it will become be very easy one day for you to say I'm just gonna let it go and I'm going to forgive them but the more you dwell on it and meditate on those things it will get stronger have a stronger hold on you so in God even said the the person who's carrying that the person who's carrying that in them it's because they're suffering from something and yet the person who caused it probably isn't even thinking about anymore or maybe they are maybe they're just being hateful to you but their freedom comes when your freedom comes so don't let that be something that consumes your Reks your life or your destiny because that happened to you don't carry it you loose it what you loose on earth they will loose in heaven and you will get to a place where it doesn't even affect you then you can say this even though I don't feel like this in my flesh I choose as an act of my will to forgive that person and that way your emotions are not even involved okay I kept Hey I just wanted to thank you first of all for your first book I took a book to Venezuela after my mother passed away and everybody got set free from greevey and yes and from depression they were so sad after they read your book I told him this is was true well my question tonight is an originally from Venezuela I've been here 40 years mm-hmm has the Lord show you anything about the evil government be in Venezuela removed absolutely soon absolutely is shown he's talked to me about Venezuela and actually I was having the event in Orlando and a woman came all the way from Venezuela right when it started brought me the Venezuelan flag and said I'm giving you to this to take before the course of heaven and before the Father himself to bring a resolution for our country so that it can be free to the people who want to serve you there will be free to serve you and God said I will do it God said it only takes one person sometimes to move his heart and then this woman came for only that reason all the way from that country with that flag so God would be able to do something because of her words and what she declared and she was from there he cannot reject or let her words drop to the ground so you will see something major happened in Venezuela what you say that's what I've been doing I can't be clear in the Venice oil I set free and I tell my family there's be set free by the Word of God the power of God amen I [Applause] would like to say one more thing about the woman who talked about unforgiveness especially especially if something happened between you and a loved one I started to start to talk about that than I didn't and finish it no matter what relationship you had here if that person goes to heaven they will have more love for you than they ever had down here on this earth love you cannot even understand in your mind right now you cannot conceive of the love of God living inside of somebody who has hope for you who is declaring over you that's asking God to bless you even if they didn't treat you right when they were here if they died suddenly and you were not expecting it they understand God understand sometimes that can create a wound and you don't let that won't be there that person is having the time of their life they're not just exist ting they're living they live in his love they're filled with his life and the greatest thing they would ever want for you is for you to complete your destiny they may their destiny may be finished in heaven sometimes some people don't realize that I've even seen young people who were raised up here on this earth and when they got to heaven they finished their destiny so even young people don't miss that and and you may heart have a hard time understanding that but God still has plans for children or for people and they have a destiny their ultimate destiny in heaven is to be that gift whether it's to run a golf course or a fishery or a carnival or a you know a rodeo have a line of bakeries in heaven whatever that gift was they never got to use on the earth they will still use that in heaven but the thing that I noticed the most on there is how much love people have I feel ways of it coming from the people these are the ones who've moved home to heaven and how much they care about their family members and they're declaring over every member of their family not just one of them so something great happens on the inside of them when they see him before the one that they came from and the Lord has courts him up the steps of the throne and gives him literally back to the Father they know they are home and they know that's who sent them to that earth men's I want encourage anybody if you've lost somebody recently they're never going to forget you they're not going to replace you no one can ever replace you on this earth but in case you wonder it's okay to love again and that may not be the right time to tell you but you just need to know that one day that may happen whoever's in heaven that loves you is not going to be angry at you if you have someone to love they're probably asking God to send you someone to love and this is the point when you get home you're not married to anybody that means you can still have them as your best friend and so that you're ready that relationship if you are married on the earth you're a little bit closer together as best friends you know the people that weren't so it's not like that relationship is gone you're just not married for a reason and this is the reason and it's a really good reason the reason we go home and we're not married when we get there we come home is the father son or daughter you live right next to the people that you were married to you'll be best friends but there's a legitimate reason because we can only have one bridegroom it would not be right and the Holy Spirit gave me this revelation just a couple weeks ago somebody was asking me about that and I said well I think there's probably a good reason why you're not married and so I was told this is why you were not married there's going to be a marriage in heaven and there can only be one bridegroom and that bridegroom is for both male and female we will be the Bride of Christ you can't be married to someone else it wouldn't be right that is that was very revelatory so knowing people I say ask me well how come on can't be married I said because you already have a marriage waiting on you in heaven and we are all patrols to one person and his name is Jesus Christ and no matter how you feel about each other here when you get there you will love him more than anyone in existence so there's only one bytecode and one bride and we're it so maybe I don't know what time it is probably have time to take a couple more Oh who's next okay other than being in the presence of the Most High God and Jesus Christ what was your most memorable and transformational experience that you took from heaven in heaven it is hard to talk about that there's probably more than one one was when I was caught up to heaven I don't remember which what time that was what what number that was I gave up after about a thousand times I stopped counting but I remember very clearly every time I've gone but the one impacted me the most because I'd seen Jesus many times on the earth doesn't mean I'm familiar with him I'm still overwhelmed and undone but this was with the father because I knew he loved everybody people picture him super glued to the throne they think he can never leave it that's ridiculous okay he goes all over heaven he's year's time with everybody in heaven but he has his own special place he takes you to and it says it talks about in the world where it says that and all you're getting of knowledge get understanding and it says that is knowledge of the Holy One that's the father so that's why he you hear me talk so much about the father Jesus said I want you to introduce the father to the earth let them know about his love what he thinks about them how they live before they were here so they'll understand and love him like they do me because there's a lot about Jesus and the board people had encounters with Jesus everywhere not so much with the father but in this time he wants us to know him so he caught me up one time when he catches me up I'm always eight years old so that's why I remember things it's real easy to remember that's what he doesn't give me things he doesn't use long words even when he speaks to me up there he speaks to me like I'm a real child I have pigtails and I'm very excited when I rob didn't want to run up and sit on his lap so he can hold me because I understand he is my my father he he's our Father and I love this goodness Abba Father you know or daddy however you want to look at it when you get there that's how you're gonna think about him he caught me up one time but it wasn't to the throne he took me by my hand and this is the thing about God he can be a 150 foot tall if he wants to be he means big as a source if he wants to be he's big okay he can hold anyone in his arms no matter how big you are here you're not so big that he can't hold you in his arms but he can also make himself smaller so he can walk right next to you so here my look grow pigtails I'm looking up at him his hair is filled with life it's white it's just beautiful as glowing his eyes have flames of fire blue flames of fire and he's got the most gentlest spirit I tell people Jesus is the Waring one Jesus is the warring King me but the father has such love in him because of his son before his sudden you know he would pour out his wrath on the others and remember that he wiped it out remember only did that he's not like that anymore because of what his son paid for he's loved itself kindness itself and he took my hand I've been doing this probably for several years you took my hand he said come I'm gonna take you into my chamber and it said on it chamber of understanding and it was this place like this massive gemstone a huge massive gemstone because you have to remember the stones of fire are in him we he has one that's his own special place that he takes people to especially when they come home to heaven so he can get to know you better and so I walked in there I wasn't afraid of anything and then it was this whirlwind of the dark glory and that says I hide myself in the dark remember the dark clouds of glory it looks like a million peacock feathers with eyes in them with real eyes and that's what he sometimes will hide himself in and but when I stepped in there with him they were gone it was this beautiful place and that wasn't massive outside but inside it was like it looks like it went forever and he looked at me said where would you like to go and I said well I want to be right here with you I don't need to go anywhere he said I can take you to the future I can show you the new earth I didn't show you things to come on what no I know I want to be here with you like I I want to be here with you I don't need to go in order goes I can take you to the past I can show you heaven before Lucifer fell I can show you before the earth was made don't you want to go and I said no right here it's where my heart is my heart is for you my heart is to do you will you love me before I came enough to send your son that you love so much that even at one point had to turn your very back on him because of he had to take all the evil and I'm just a little girl saying this to him Hey because you wanted me just like me and there's no greater place anyone could ever desire to be tend to be with me and so I know it blessed his heart so much that's why I remember it so clearly that it was burned in me and I can't see him any other way I can't see him as a god of Wrath I can't see him as a God of anger or vengeance or a wanting to pour something up on you if he is willing to give the most precious thing he had for us before even while we were yet sinners he sent his precious son who was everything they did everything together before even became Jesus when he was the word they created together they went everywhere together and he was willing to send them you know why so we could come back to him that's how much he loves people he loves them that's why he is long-suffering that's why he said he doesn't even want the vilest sinner set free but we have to make a choice he won't force people to take him and I know right now there's people preaching that God's going to restore all things and they throw in that when they say that they literally mean everything he's gonna not make a new earth he's gonna restore this one he's gonna forgive Satan he's gonna remove the fallen angels he's gonna make it like it never happened that is not what he said and I would just say what he said to me he said I cannot allow things to come to this holy place he said I gave my son I'm not keeping you out of heaven I'm making a way for you to come to heaven because I am not allowing or permitting evil wickedness sin to come back into this place again and pollute I can't do it so I'm not doing something to keep you out I did something to let you come in but you have to make that choice he says so people who say a loving God wouldn't send people to hell I don't I make a way so they don't have go there but they will choose their self where they will live so he is a loving God but he doesn't want you wouldn't want he said if I let everyone on earth who ever existed to come to heaven then heaven would be just like the earth and that is not going to happen you would not want that to happen yourself so unfortunately there are people in hell I have been to hell he won't let me talk about it because he's still introducing heaven it's real it's worse than you ever dreamed like heaven is great or Mabuse 11 then you ever great dreamed Satan loves nobody well I give yourself I'm not willing so praise that you won't be willing and you will learn to forgive and you will learn to but this is the thing you can share love love is the greatest thing he ever made but love includes truth I used to say you can't give love and not give truth because you're not really loving but actually it's part of it so if you love you have to share the truth amen so don't leave it out somewhere and just only share love he'll love people all the way to hell because they're choosing that love is a wonderful way to show them you care and he cares but you can't leave out the truth amen so any more questions oh she has a question from Facebook oh let her answer yes we're we want to know what God wants to do for Colorado and we were battling Hell here and we need help from heaven to overcome the fifth chair I do know that and so does God he's not ignorant to anything and Colorado is also gonna be a region of light and let me tell you what the people sitting in this room have Authority enough to do that you don't need to look to heaven to bring a lightning bolt down here strike someone dead that you don't like who is in office it's your authority taking over the evil the demonic that is ruling that is controlling those people that's why we were given an army they will bombard continually send them continually to wherever that person sits whatever their title is send them against the demonic controlling them I will also add this we're living in a time where if they won't yield God will take them from the earth that would be his last choice but because of this time were in that he calls holy and powerful for us he wants us especially if it's a place he calls his own and I don't know why he some would be regions of light popping because of who will choose to live in those places reasons the regions of darkness and talk too fast regions of darkness will exist because people want them and the regions of light will begin to produce the glory of God and those people will run from those places because they so want the evil they still want to live that way they want that lifestyle they will not be able to live in a place for God the glory of God is powerful and the reason it's powerful is because you're carrying it it's not a great wave coming from heaven to sit on a place it will be in us Christ in us is the hope of glory that glory will become a region in places in the earth so what you do is begin to live more like God declare like him hear him come against any evil entities spiritual entities and they will begin to be driven out and then the influence they had over those people will be gone and fear will fall on those who are leading that's how it works so it's in you and the way you live your life and what you say and how you operate is what will change things in this earth Damon okay we're gonna let somebody on line ask a question you can I have the microphone I wasn't gonna ask any of these questions I told him on Facebook that I was screams taking screenshots of them to save them for a future podcast but this one needs to be answered and I know you've talked about this before but it's kind of a two-part question the first part she said can a believer who commits suicide go to heaven and the reason she asked is because Judas had committed suicide in the Bible but a young girl said that she saw him in heaven I don't know who the young girl was but he is in hell and even Jesus himself said that he did not remain with him number one Judas was never a true believer he fought against everything Jesus did he wanted Jesus to take over the world so he would benefit from it he did not have any love for him at all and he gave himself to Satan he never repented for what he did he went out for the guilt he had he hung himself judas is in hell and Jesus said father I have all those that you gave me save the son of perdition he did not have him because he was in hell well I can answer the other part of that question why she probably thought she saw him there is a mock heaven in a mock Hell there are things that are built in the spirit realm there's there all around you a lot of them are built by heaven and heaven uses them when their angels are sent on an assignment there's also something built by Hell not very well none of their stuff looks very good but they have places for the demons to gather and in infiltrate places and stuff like that and they have built to bring confusion to the body because the father is catching so many people up to heaven and so many people down to hell Satan always does something to try to stop it bring confusion or counteract it so it would look like somebody's not telling the truth and one of those places is a mock hell and this is the thing about the enemy when he thinks he's winning he gets very sloppy and then he becomes not intelligent and then he'll show people he'll this is something you have to test spirits if an angel comes up you said I'm here to take you somewhere you have to say are you from the spirit of the Most High God who sent his son you die it's very simple you ask them that they can't lie there's no way they cannot they will disappear or they'll say nothing to you but most people just go with them and if you go that means you're open to be shown whatever if it's not an angel there's still demons that can have a measure of light in them now every one of them look like defiled horrible ugly things so if people don't ask like someone a leader in the body was caught up by supposing aliens to be to Saturn did the wings of Saturn and this actually happened and they didn't test them so they went to the rings of Saturn by these demons who said they were aliens and they gave them higher enlightenment to know about the gods of the Egyptians and now they have rejected Jesus Christ they date everything we judge did everything about him said they now serve the God of the Egyptians that's why you have to test spirits so that was not real saddened by the way there was a mock place made in the spirit realm to look like that okay something that is just very right now it's really critical because a lot of people are talking about this the ascension movement where they get in groups and as an act of their will they are all group lifted to what they say is heaven could they be actually going to a mock realm that is is a counterfeit since I've never been a part of that group I know things like that happen and there's always the chance of that happening if you don't have the opportunity to question who is taking you I do know that people are doing that I know some people got his commission to do that there's some people who decide in their own soul to do it their self that is not wise because we do within us the way God made us we do have different authorities within us we have abilities to come in and speak to things and that's how a lot of people got caught in the New Age movement years ago now people are caught in to all kinds of things and they don't understand it's not God because this is saying if they have a real encounter that's the point they made I had a real encounter when a lot of people have real encounters but where did you go and who took you there that's how Satan gets away with these mock places and he's caught all kinds of people to the mock heaven and they all meet mother Mary who was ruling there there's always some kind of a thing that gives you hints something's not right always because I've heard of many encounters people have and there's always a measure of something that is not truth people are caught in the mock hell they're shown children in hell that is absolutely a lie there are no children in hell these people have also seen and talked with mother Mary in heaven that is not true she does not call herself that she is Mary who bore Jesus but she worshiped worships Jesus Christ as her own Savior and then more encounter started building and building Satan took a lot of people to hell because he enjoyed it and it wasn't even the real hell because if they had been to the real hell they'd still be screaming they wouldn't act like it was so nonchalant well I saw Christians there and I was told they won't help because they wore blue jeans how many people got blue jeans on them and then they were told that the Christians weren't helped because they had colored highlights in their hair and then somebody else was taken to the mock Kalen they were said they're always told these are Christians these are Christians because they wore jewelry the horrible part about it is these people believe it because they were little taken by a spiritual being through the spirit room to a place that to them was literally real so that's why it's you need an understanding of the spirit realm you need to understand what that place is it's the original realm that God made it was made before the physical realm in order to make this physical planet he had to take like a canvas the physical realm and stretch it around part of the spiritual realm so we could hang all the planets in the sky so we would have a place to live and have physical body so this stuff happens but Satan still has powers I mean he'll do anything you can to lie to people if you can get them to to be deceived and they say yes then they can be taken to places and he'll say as an angel light this is now your assignment years ago all of this world and share this truth and it's a lie so it's bringing confusion to the body because people thought well I thought I thought you couldn't fake anything well if you believe the father of lies and he's one who created the lie yes but there's a way not to be deceived okay number one don't want after things that you're not aware of or how to operate in those places God give you commissions if an angel really came from him and was supposed to take you you can ask that angel if he says yes I was sent by the Most High then you should certainly go but but this is happening everywhere and I've even seen some people on shows talking about their experiences in Hell and they didn't go to the real hell they didn't go to the real heaven okay they never talk about the glory the splendor the love of God they always talk about people who would not I've heard him talk about people that wouldn't be in heaven I've also talked about people who they say are in Hell and are not in Hell so you have to know who's sharing and you have to know yourself how to discern the spirit and so if anything comes to you and sit just was to go with me you would do if it was a person wouldn't it I mean if some stranger came to your door and said you're supposed to go with me I'm gonna take you so and so we're going to go to the White House go that would you with that person I hope not well it's no difference in the spirit room so you just have to know who is talking to you and if they have the right to talk to you you always have the right to refuse and if you refuse this God and you've tested them they said yes I'm from God and you don't go he'll probably give you another chance and we're done the line to go so yes yes and Satan in the in the day is coming one of the one of the there's we know their signs and wonders but to be unholy signs and wonders it talks about them in the Bible too and this is the thing he will heal people they'll actually have witches don't trust a witch don't watch witchcraft don't read witchcraft have nothing to do with witchcraft witchcraft is real it was real back in the day of Jesus is still real now and none of it is good none of it it is the most controlling thing you can get involved with and you will be deceived over and over again and that's not a good thing and this is what Satan will do he'll have because people be having miracles everywhere right so Satan will have his own in the park and they'll say these witches will say come and join us we're a good coven we love people we can heal you do you have something needs to be healed and they'll heal them in front of everybody all Satan has to do is remove the disease that he put there and it will be a mock healing just to bring deception to people so we're a little ways away from that happening but as much as you can get understanding on the better your prepared but I will just say this to you Satan has used Harry Potter for years to introduce witchcraft is being good if you read it loose it from your soul if you have it get rid of it if you just watch it lay their hands and loose it from their soul because the author hates Christians and they literally practice witchcraft and that book I've never read it but people tell me stuff in it some of those acts that they do in those books and now this they sell spell kits is real witch cloud there are even a Harry Potter University being built in Richmond Virginia and guess how many people Robbie's in there because it's a fantasy they think and not a fantasy nothing from hell is a fantasy amen so there's always there's always good stuff to share with you powerful stuff to share with you but but if you can receive a warning that will save you a lot of stuff later in your life then just receive it because I do know I'm going to see her since there's a little girl and I saw operations of Hell everywhere I know what they do to trick people mark people follow people so when you send get marked by the enemy then they follow you and try to get you to fall again so nothing's being hidden there's an unseen world sees you all the time okay so live up right right just get rid of the junk get rid of it it'll be like it was never there enemy will have no way to track you or find you and he should have nothing to do with you no right to do anything to you and you can say that too but the good news is this we're entering into a time where you have to understand the more of God the spirit realm around you which has always been here I see beings operating everywhere all the time even here what I've been present in the hotel outside the hotel everywhere I go I see activities I am purpose sometimes we'll say something to the demons because they don't think you can see them I make sure they know who I believe then I ask the host to go attack them then they run screaming down the street the host is just falling behind and whacking them with their sword you know crushing them and so I reek havoc wherever I go that's good and there are kids doing it right now their children will be raised in this time to begin to know we find out about the glory we will get to carry the glory but our kids will live in the glory and their kids will know nothing but the glory which is why God needs generations on the earth when you start something new he needs generally in order for it to operate so I can say if you're young you have a long powerful life ahead of you and if you're not young asked to be timeless and get ready to live longer because you have a decision to make for God you don't have to be bound by time even now if you choose not to so this is a great time to be on the earth I think we'll probably take one more one more question does he have a question oh I want to hear his question okay he was curious to know if you could describe what heaven looks like specifically wondering is it bright yellow is it golden but if you could maybe describe its characteristics landscapes just I I can share Hume in this but I've seen so much of it it is all light there's no darkness in heaven nobody ever sleeps because they never get tired they have rainbow bridges they have arrogance they can fly on they have dinosaurs you can ride on they have fountains filled with chocolate and home is made out of jell-o you can eat they have a fantastic you can go into cartoon village and write a cartoon out and then you go in and you are it okay this is heaven this is really heaven they have rodeos they have they have they have hunting but you do it with a camera the point is this when you hunt the creature you're looking for a supernatural spiritual being it will get you before you ever get it you go back to the clubhouse and there's your face plastered on a 40-foot screen because the creature you're looking for got you first they celebrate Christmas in heaven everybody will end with this one who is it oh the friendly forest there is a friendly forest where the trees talk and they will sing and dance with you even the stones little stones pebbles jump up and down with faces and they sing glories to God the tree cannot brood itself and go to your mansion and root itself and be a friend and talking to have conversations with you I've seen all of us in heaven my sister Jen is writing children's books that will show a lot of these scenes in heaven for children will know the truth about heaven and our Lord and the father and the angels angels are made out of everything they don't all look like us probably half of them don't have our creatures they're very fierce through the army they have weapons coming out of them so trust me the army that bur Texas is through hell terrifying the glory of God is everywhere father sends a wave of his rainbow through heaven to look for you and bring you back to himself in the throne room you never want to leave there they celebrate they have celebrations in the throne room works like a big party they like celebrations sometimes worship is just jump it up and down and screaming you know like they do here on this earth that came from heaven it all creates glory for god it's worship for god angels love to crowd surf at some of the concerts they have in heaven there are real beings that have personalities they care very much for us God made them for us that they're not against you amen any other questions oh I have to answer that one asked he was asking about if anybody commits suicide did they go to heaven it depends on of us actually suicide or not I was caught up by the father on purpose I was going to go to Penn State and he said I'm gonna have you bust a myth that's been around for a long time that people cannot take their life and go to heaven he said that depends on if this suicide or not he said go look up the word suicide in the dictionary sometimes yes me do it and it says someone who willingly knowingly intelligently in the right mind decide they're going to end their life usually is to hurt people like terrorists like terrorist bombers they on purpose choose to no longer live they do it usually for a horrible purpose but what most people are doing aren't ending their life they're ending their suffering and God says I judge and then after he said that he took me three times to heaven people who had ended their suffering but loved Jesus Christ they all three were in heaven they did not want to stop living they loved their families but they saw no other escape the pain was so great they had some of them one had mental issues one had medical issues one had emotional issues and and most of the time one of it was from medicine that was given them to heal them it gave them trauma and continual suicidal thoughts flooded them and today I can't handle this anymore I'm going home to Jesus and they ended their suffering and God said I don't want everyone thinking their loved ones who knew me who believed in me who trusted me even if they fell for some reason but they never gave me up or quit loving me and something happened and their life ended they are not in hell he said I would be an unjust god if I took somebody who loved me and served me and they had an accident and something happened physically to their head that they weren't thinking right all they knew was pain and agony and they couldn't live they couldn't handle the suffering or the thing with the medicine that actually happens a lot they even have things on bottles that say it could give you suicidal thoughts and so God said I'm gonna make sure you understand this he put despair on me despair is what comes right before suicide and you begin to have those thoughts he made me carry it for a week and tell nobody and all I could think in my head it was like I was literally experiencing it there was no I felt no hope and this is and I knew him there was no hope in my mind that this would ever end all I could think of was I'm getting out of here I can't bear to be here this is so great I wanted to be taken but he wouldn't take it from me he told me first he said I will not take it off of you at the end of the week I will take it off of you and you will never forget what that felt like and you understand my people cannot take the agony or the suffering of that bombarding them all the time and it was horrible at the end of the week it was like it never happened and what huh I'm gonna go share that message everywhere and after that I went to Pennsylvania for the first time and shared that message and I found out several people in the meeting had had loved ones who had done that they all ran down front they were crying they were hanging on to me and there was even a well-known person I won't mention their name that their son took his life his ended his suffering and he had been in an accident a well-known person and so this young man has served God his whole life he was like in his late 20s loved Jesus but all he kept saying was I can't handle this he'd been an accident they gave him this medicine they took him off the medicine they had to put him back on the medicine and he finally said I can't I'm leaving I'm leaving he kept telling I'm leaving and then they found him and he was dead and God and he was coming to our city to speak and God said his wife is hiding herself the mother is hiding herself because of all the believer saying is too bad your son is burning in hell the world didn't say that the world this is the awful part the world said were so sorry for your loss you know we want to help console' you we want to comfort you this is the world but the ones in the body were saying instantly he was burning in hell so she hid she wouldn't come out she wouldn't go anywhere she didn't want her face to be seen and she was grieving already right and God said I'm not tolerating this I'm gonna let them know exactly what their son is doing he caught me up to heaven I saw their son I didn't know about them and how was taken to his father's managing because this man was young and I was taken to his father's literally his father's managin being built in heaven and it had this great mantle it was at the foot of the mountain of spices and it was absolutely beautiful and that's where he was staying at that time and there was a trophy on the mantle that said Satan 0 God 1 and it was he was saying that Satan did not get their son then it was walked to the management I saw siblings that weren't even born yet in photographs in this person's mansion and then I saw the son another time he was packing up a horse he was going to go to the mountain of spices to go do a hunt and he said I wish my dad knew there's a new way to shoot animals that won't hurt them and he was packing camera gear so this is how I found out about the hunting and he was going up into these woods to go hunting and he said man I remember all the fun I had with my dad and my brothers one who did this but it's even better now and so I saw these creatures hunting behind the trees I'm sure there was some of the ones he was going to try to get I saw him stop by the clubhouse and register that he was going on this hunt so if he if his scope got the picture that it would be put up there your picture okay is in the in the in the corner the one who took the picture the one they captured is on the screen most of the time the creatures here in Europe they're on the screen so all that was happening and I wrote three pages three days in a row God took me to heaven and showed me the Sun I was also taken into his mother's mansion which was right next door had the name of the family over this part because they were like I called him like like community or family mansions like you live in a whole wing of your own this wing could be like fifty thousand hundred thousand square feet it could be half the size of a city because God's gracious and so I typed all this up he was coming to speak I took it to my pastor and said I got this word he read it he was crying goes you make sure he gets that word they are suffering so much he said I'm an agreement with his word that hit their son it changed him forever it changed his mom came out of hiding she was filled with joining the celebration the father was weeping to know that God cared enough to show that his son were his son was I didn't know where they lived they lived at the big mountains at the bottom of the big mountains in Colorado and so he said that's why I made their mansions there because I knew they would love it and he said and and and this person said we went hunting I took my son's hunting all the time well it wasn't really to kill something as much as it was to have the experience of being together and then all these things I saw was exactly the way they lived their life things he said himself for his mother I saw him wearing plaid like this plaid shirt and jeans and that was exactly what it was wearing when they found him so every over and over again I saw things that disconfirmed them that their son was in heaven amen so thank you thank you

[Applause] and for those as she's getting things set up we have baskets up here and those are offering baskets hi Susan good to see you sister offering baskets if you hear something which you will and when you hear something that you want to sow into and grab it you sow into it we want to bless her so much when she goes back she's gonna freak out when she sees the multiplication that happens because she is a prophetess and we want to bless the prophetess in her ministry so so because she's gonna go and we're gonna pass baskets at the end but if you have to leave early please make your way up here if you don't if that weirds you out to come up then give it to one of the ushers that are standing in the back and they will receive that offering and put it in the offering basket for you can you turn her up Lisa please oh now you can hear me okay yeah I can hear now it's just making is that making it rain I'm always excited to come here because I don't have you know boundaries put on me some places just afraid of the new and actually it's not really new it's just being revealed and all through time God has done that when it was his time to do something new it was revealed in the earth it was always his plan we're just finding out about it and that's true in every age this come on this earth God has done something new new things to say new ways to live new ways to operate like them because the Bible says we're supposed to do that right course food who are we supposed to be like say Jesus really loud does he want us to operate like he did then don't be afraid to do it you know I'm not afraid of the face of man that's not gonna work I've already been in his presence I know what his heart is I know what the father's plans are for the sir it's not time to end it yet I tell people stop fighting about the time when you want to escape on your rapture odd I have news for everybody the rapture is not an escape it will be a celebration isn't that true it's a celebration because an escape would be fear and he has nothing to do with fear and neither should you there should be no fear in you God holds you in his hand when he's ready he's taking you home nobody can stop that but if he want you to stay nobody can stop that either you know John could have stayed John the Beloved could still be here amongst us if he decided to stay because Jesus said to the disciples what is it you but I love him to remain until they come again has he come again yet then that means John could be here correct how long would that have been so if God decides to keep somebody two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred years now what is it you I'm saying yes by the way I won't even buy a life insurance policy my staff walked into the phone when people want to sell life insurance oh she doesn't want it well can we ask her no it won't do any good but everybody needs it and they go no she's not planning on dying and then they hang up and we all laughed for that but I'm not I have no plans I lay down my life I live in him as long as he wants me here I'm staying I know John missed what he saw he missed it so much he couldn't stand to be here anymore nobody took his life either nobody killed him no disease took his life he decided to go how about that it's people go oh no you you can't choose with this day or not yes I can I can choose that it's up to him when I go but I don't want to go I'm not missing anything I'm not missing anything he's gonna do on this earth as long as he wants me to here be here I'm staying and one day I want you to plan to come here I'm just letting you know that I'll just show up I walked through the wall I've been here on the blackboard in heaven they have no time I want to live that way I want to be just like them let us make man in our image and after all excuse me I've been talking so much I don't know where I left my water I think it's on the floor that's somewhere I'll be sharing about this a little bit but I just got back from Hollywood and I talked non-stop I did make some side meetings so I'm not even talking about the meetings I did I'm talking about the producer I met with [Music] God is taking Hollywood I mean seriously he is taking it and he'll is terrified no he'll can get mad but the time will come when they get so afraid of you you become dangerous well I'm dangerous and when I go in somewhere in Hollywood they run out they won't they won't they can't stand to be near me they don't want to be near me they will burn like they will literally burn and they'll feel the pain I'm of sure one day says make them feel the pain and on the back will be a devil and they'll be going like this I want to share a couple things though before I actually start because I almost never do this but we actually have some new things we're in Phase two of what God called me to do the first whole half not half the first season I had in doing this was to reveal heaven to earth the second season is to create heaven on earth that season will be much longer than the first one it's still a way to reveal it but why not be able to hold it or wear it or sit on it or watch or have it in your walls or have it in your floors heaven is invading literally invading people's lives everywhere in ways that we maybe not expect one of it is going to be the movie industry and so God is making us extremely bold about what we say so there's no question when you're in that arena you need to make sure there's no question about who you represent I'm gonna make that perfectly clear and then the Holy Spirit always gives us new little we call them Kingdom quotes but they're actually Holy Spirit quotes he makes me save him I purpose because he likes to hear them and our newest one is I don't do demons in case hell should wander by we want to make sure they remember the day they were kicked out with a lightning bolt which is right in the middle there you go bring back back back to the remembrance in case they forgot so this is a car magnet we don't do traditional bumper stickers just can go on your car and it's huge [Laughter] it does get looks we just released it about a month ago we have buttons that you can wear and talk about you want to make a conversation just wear one and walk somewhere and people love especially in our country they love to read any kind of a sign or button you're wearing or t-shirt or cap that you have to see what it says they literally have to see it and I've seen people follow people down the street so they can finally read the bumper sticker so now they see this and right along with this one we have other ones we have one that says roll up your wraps your rug and rule okay so right there's I don't do demons roll up your rapture rug and rule there you go what does that mean one of my staff said why don't we just say roll up your wraps are there every Baptists on the earth could be so mad at us they'd be thrown things out so we got to say why okay why number one it is not time for the rapture right now we haven't occupied that means take Dominion take Dominion deucey do something powerful with your life I will I'd I had to read an entire movie script in 20 hours because I will be editing it thank God Margaret was with me and this can be powerful not like anything you have seen on this earth anywhere not anywhere at all and so we also have along with the census since this is the Holy Spirit's favorite quote right now we also have a cup cozies and if I can get it on here I might it does if it fits water bottles but it also fits cups and then make it fit this one now nobody has these yet it also says I don't do demons take your water bottle to work set it around you will stir up things so these are brand new and everything we have is made in America since I'm going to market this okay this is sewn on two sides but it lays flat for traveling we plan to take hundreds of these overseas with us and and it says they don't do demons and on the back is where you can find out more revealing heaven calm and the Holy Spirit picks the colors everything he wanted to make sure you could see this a mile away okay so this is another thing we've got right here we we have we have gone back because we used to have these when I first started we didn't have any maintenance so we've had some new ones made it does have the book cover on it revealing heaven we'll have a book to also have one with its colors and when I get booked three them will do that this is also made in America this opens and shuts it does not come off and this however you get it off you snap it off but look how hard that is this double double pane double insulated made in America dishwasher safe microwave-safe how about that and yeah for hot or cold and it works we've tested all of our own stuff so I love that we can put maybe this is our newest one it literally just came out hey we made this thing as big as the magnet are you kidding 22 ounces I don't do jima that's good because this one is yours and I love the colors we make sure everything matches well you know the Holy Spirit doesn't like a lot of clutter on things because they want you to see what it's sayin right and so this is our newest one we literally just got them I love them and because we're making a statement this is what the Holy Spirit said you're making a statement about who you are and what you stand for without blasting any other denomination or religion you're literally can safely if you care make a statement about what you believe in what you don't tolerate and people are sowing dunks they've never seen anything like this before you know it's either something very liberal or demonic or you might have a cross on something but God is into saying very plainly what he means and this means you are not partnering nor tolerating nor participating with darkness of any kind whatsoever and so people have to say well what does that mean well I just tell them that means I torment demons that's what it means and then I quote a scripture you know this is what this means this is our privilege in this time as the body of Christ you know God had his time when he kicked him out of heaven right when they were all became evil and then Jesus had his time when he wasted hell on the third day and melted the faces of the principalities and powers in hell stripped their leader of everything took every gemstone off that God put on him and took the keys of hell death in the break so guess who gets the third show we do God said oh it's the show he said I am a show person all the way I was the first show man in the center ring when I kicked all those all those demonic angels out that they rose up against me he said there was light lightning bolt there was action they went down there was lights and there was action ok this is the Sun in hell all darkness you know ready for by the way Satan was planning a show by the way if you didn't know that he was Satan was planning a show himself to torture the Son of God in front of all of his demons and he actually called in the principalities and powers because they don't stay in Hell they are seated on Thrones on dark Thrones all around this world so he called them in to hell to the courtyard of Hell where he was going to put the show on well guess what the Son of God put the show on and it says so in the Bible he spoiled ruined principalities and powers and made a show of it openly triumphing in it I call that a show there was lights the fire of God coming out of his hands there was action the melting faces of the principalities and there was a lot of noise the demons screaming now we get to manifest and demonstrate for him in this earth doing supernatural signs and wonders the greater works stunning hell and shocking this world so whether you knew it or not you're the 3rd show how about that so we like to make things that are you know preparing for the show right I'm wearing this pin that I wore the first time it was in 2016 early in 2016 when the elections well the the campaigning was going on and it says let the show begin and it has begun don't totally begun these are these coasters the ones that are made out of the pressed whatever that is they can get wet and then they drown you reuse them reuse them this is the weather warriors which we also are kind of still in charge of them what are the weather warriors we tell the weather what it cannot do we're not we're not stopping the weather we're stopping the destruction of Hell getting in the weather when God created weather for this earth he did not create it to be destructive it was a nourish and replenish the earth in the winter it was to cover up like the earth thrust right and and it does a lot of other things like kill the insects and the bugs unfortunately in Florida we don't get a lot of snow we didn't get a lot we don't get a lot of that down there but other places have it so God designed this earth to operate in a certain way but since there's a wicked evil being who hates everyone and including the earth here he has tried to take over himself and yet the Bible clearly says Jesus gave us power this is not my message yet this is my introduction the word clearly says that Jesus said to all believers I give you power over the power of the enemy so this is using that power right here God did did not design hurricanes himself Satan gets involved in that and gets controlling them he wants to kill steal and destroy and he will use that in any form of whether he can while we're stopping it yes we have a right because Jesus said we were joint heirs what he did we can do he stopped to storm people we actually do that and there's a whole lot of people we now call them the weather warrior so God had us design a logo God is into images trust me this is another logo almost everything we have it's either a logo or it's the beginning of a move of God because I don't get to do anything that's normal okay I'm never gonna be normal not ever another thing we have the right to do is to command the host of heaven some of you may have a problem with this don't be concerned about commanding the host of heaven that would be the army of heaven and and God loves that army he designed them to war for us they are not protecting heaven they never have protected heaven they don't need to protect heaven the one who made them is on the throne so they've never stopped people from coming up into heaven and taking things okay although somebody translated that word you know about the kingdom of heaven suffering violence they think that means that people from earth are going up there and stealing things that literally came out of a Bible translation it really did I don't know how they got that I don't know where that even came from okay that scripture has a revelation to it the scripture is from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force is that correct is that what that scripture says well everybody's focusing on the word suffers because they don't understand although scripturally there is another meaning for that and the Holy Spirit showed me think of this scripture suffer the little children to come unto me now does that mean the little children are being attacked say no does that mean that he's saying cause the little children to come unto me encourage the little children to come unto me so let's put that word in the other scripture from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven encourages and causes spiritual violence to rise up on the inside of you so you the believer can take it by force from the enemy now that scripture makes sense doesn't it because it does not mean the other thing there's literally no way anyone's gonna get up to heaven without God's permission amen they want us to be spiritually violent that word is that means passionately violent against the spiritual darkness don't tolerate them don't participate with them and there's another scripture that clearly says that our weapons of warfare are not natural they are not physical but they are spiritual they say the word day they are supernatural and spiritual weapons and they pull down what what kind of strongholds are they pulling down they pull down principalities right and strongholds of darkness is that right that sounds like an army to me an army we've almost been totally ignoring for a very long time and yet they were created by God for us to be over angels are not over us it says in the times to come we will judge them does that say that the Bible so if we're going to judge them then they can't be over us is that correct we have some authority over them we cannot worship them but commanding if you look in the dictionary if you look at the word commanding it does not mean worship it does not mean we're worshipping but I happen to known the military must have orders I've had so many members of my family in the military including my husband was in the Marine Corps they cannot work on their own can you imagine them running out of boot camp taking weapons they barely not go in attacking things does that happen do they have to have orders from headquarters even when they're overseas they have somebody over them that has to give them orders heavens army is no different I have news to me even though there's an army that army cannot leave their bitters in heaven attack whoever they feel like that's not going to happen they have to have orders they operate by orders they harpin under the word of the lord so that means you're not going to move this army unless he lives in you and he operates through you they're gonna listen to anybody else but there had to come a time on this earth in order for them to fulfill their destiny that we could send them on missions ourselves are we joint heirs with Christ was he the Lord of Hosts did he command heavens army is that our right then why aren't we doing it well I know you are now but every time I introduce the army of heaven I always have to go through this preparation for people that never considered in their head they know what praying to Jesus they ask Jesus to send help but if we're like them and they create we can create if they come in weak in command is that right it is always his power that does it we don't do anything without Christ we don't get anything we can't have anything we can't just choose to do stuff on our own even in the same way we don't operate without Christ that army cannot operate without commanders back in 2014 I was shown millions of the army of heaven being sent to this earth and they were waiting 2014 the father introduced me to the army of heaven and taught me how to command them from that day I have not ever been attacked I am never sick they were made to keep us and protect us in all our ways the Angels we have with us all the time they're sent at the time of our conception at the time we are conceived they are sent I see them all the time waiting outside pregnant mothers those angels I know where hers are those angels that are waiting you're waiting for that baby to be born that's when you have guardian angels they don't just come to you and get a certain age they're there with you your entire life they have already got their orders from the Father they know boundaries that they have they know what they were sent there for the army has another purpose they are sent to attack and destroy the plans of the dark armies Satan has an army too it's not as big it's not as well organized it does not love each other they hate each other they kind of do what they wanted they get punished a lot but God's army cares about each other they work well together they are fierce against the darkness they don't ever abandon their post they're very destructive they operate in the spirit realm wherever you send them wherever there is darkness whether it was evil wherever there is violence you can send them there this earth is going to change drastically when the body of Christ finally stops fighting it arguing with it not wanting to do anything with it because they're afraid their lives are going to change especially in this time on the earth when God is boldly gonna have a step forth and start doing things okay and going places where they never wanted to go before you send the army before you all the strongholds are pulled down and we just had friends that just witnessed that I kept telling them they go on these missions trips all over Korea and the last time all the reporter was how many times they got attacked how many people were put in hospitals the own people in the hospital how many places they got rejected in places already agreed to have them come and I said when they were done but you did send the army right we forgot so when they went this year they sent me a text we have sent our army every one of us we are given them very specific detailed orders and every place we go they'll go there first they'll be there while we're there we don't expect a no holdups delays incidents accident sicknesses nothing of any kind happen every time they went to I forgot how many like 2030 cities they went to Korea I got a report every time every single time they were going to know that they know they sent the army not one incident not in their travel not in their protection not in the places they stayed in not the cities they went to there were so many miracles and souls one and the joy of it all they had any interference from the devil not one not one not one they want me to come back right away so that I can again teach and train their entire congregation how to command their own army from heaven that will live over your home in the sky they do not go back to heaven they are assigned by heaven to you people walk down my street look over my home all the time they can see beings there all the time don't look for somebody that looks like you those are Gabriel's group Gabriel's group look like humans except they have wings sometimes they hide them there on a Centon assignment on the earth could get easily move around amongst us the hosts of heaven would not be able to do that someone have six-inch years coming out of every pore of their being some are the weapon themselves they have 18 eyes okay they're made out of every kind of form of substance you can think of they could not easily move amongst us people would call them aliens and probably have in the past they're creatures almost every one of them are creatures creatures are in heaven they're ones that look like what we call part human part animal the living creatures don't get freaked out I'll give you proof the living creatures around the throne do not look like humans they have massive heads that are curved like this I know when people say they've seen them because that's what their heads are shaped like the one like a lion the one like an eagle the one like an ox the one that has the face of a man does not look like Jesus Christ because you have wonder they have eyes in their heads in the back of their heads and every one of their six wings they have hooves golden hooves for their feet they walk upright they have these gossamer gowns on that make a frequencies and they're about 80 to 100 foot tall every one of them are fierce don't go up to heaven try to make friends with them and the two that hold up the arms of the throne are even more weird they each have four heads they would not easily mix with people on the earth God has planned every design of every being he has ever made including you he knew what your face would look like before he made you before you were on the earth you got your body in heaven you were a little spiritual being some different sizes about this biggest different sizes you are made out of light you lived in him you moved in and out of him on the Rays of his rainbow that was the only place they could go move in and out they played inside they played in the River of Life that's where you were that's where you came from that's why he is your father that's why you are his sons and daughters you are says you are his offspring so anyone reunion if you have children let me see your hands are your children your offspring did the mother carry those offspring yes so she nurtured them right she carried them she had water in her womb so they would feel like it was a familiar place because inside the father is the river of life we played in it we moved in it that's where you lived you lived in the river of life you played on the stones of fire that's why we like sparkly things the stone sapphire huge gemstones inside the father you've jumped on them you played on them you slid down this mountain this powerful mountain that is inside the father you'd slide down the river of life you jump off the gem stones into the river of life and that's where you played so when you made the womb of a woman he put water in it so while you were growing inside you wouldn't be afraid we couldn't leave his presence and live somewhere in heaven you have not lived on the earth before some people believe all kinds of crazy things you didn't come to the earth until he sent you here he knit you together in your mother's womb when he took that little spirit of life from himself sent it by the Holy Spirit at the time of conception he knit it and attached it to that dot of flesh that is when life begins he sent you from himself he made this whole earth this physical realm just so he could send you here and you could have a body that's how well he plans he knows every day of your life he planned good things for you not the bad there's the evil being here named Satan some people think even he does not excuse me I've been to hell and I've seen him he hates everybody but himself his plan is to wipe you out every way he can anytime you can and right now powerful powerful children are being sent to this earth for the years that are starting on this earth some of the greatest leaders in the body of Christ they're still being born he needed him here now so he timed your birth on the earth you are wonderfully and perfectly made you carry parts of his image outside and inside how did I get all this information because I've been caught up to heaven non-stop since 1996 I didn't ask for that I don't I don't know how to tell you to get that Commission I was given the Commission I don't decide when I go how long I Stay I don't decide what I go see he does I come from many generations of believers who were sold out in love with Jesus Christ many of them had encounters with him but even the ones that didn't he never step back and they went forward in their life they touch this earth impacted this earth with their life never stopped loving God never stopped trusting him never ever ever ever I'm seventh generation I should be different I was not raised normally like a lot of people were I knew who God was from the time I could before I could walk I remember even laying in his hand when he was sitting on the throne he was talking to me I was about this big like this like a little like I was and even at that time this I know they say you know the sex of the child was determined in certain ways down here but let me tell you he wrote on your soul what you would be because he determined who he needed you to be male or female there is no other choice on your will on your will your will which is one of those powerful things you have I'm still not starting yet who here does not know but human soul looks like we see your hands if you don't know literally how it's made you know what your mind your will and your emotions but do you know what those things look like he showed me back in 2010 he showed me I have a photographic memory which comes in really handy with what I do cuz I've remembered every single time my mistake in heaven he showed me the human soul because he's gonna release something that would change the body of Christ forever and that's exactly what he said to me when they learn how to really guard their soul they can cause it to prosper their self when they get their soul to prosper they will always prosper and they will live in divine health so I am never sick because I order my soul accordingly I let no darkness in I don't watch anything that belongs I don't read it I don't watch it and I don't say it and I don't listen to it either it says guard your heart that is your soul you know the heart the word heart means something more than this thing is it on this side I forget this beating thing is not what he's talking about guard your heart is not about this heart it's this one the very core of your being in your spirit man is where your soul is guard that fraud will flow the way you live your life the issues of life for out of this soul that you have inside you will determine how you live your life as a man thinketh in his soul so is he so if you don't like you you can change it if you don't like things happening to you you can change that too if you don't like the atmosphere in your home you can change that too according to what you say what you think how you order your life can change your life when Adam was laying there not alive and God blew the Father the word was with him the word was always with him when they created that's why you can say talking of the word there's nothing that was made that was not made by him well how come the father was there they worked together all the time God spoke it the word made it that's how it works whenever the father said the word that's why it was his name would make it they were always together so they were together in the garden the word made Adam but he was missing something he wasn't alive he needed his spirit his little spirit man that had lived in God all that time kept him knew who he would become he leaned over and breathed that little spirit man these fear of life from inside himself or he had been living into Adams nostrils and then he said Adam has become a living soul that's very important that was now saying because we had souls wanted living in God we just didn't really need them because your soul you decide where you're gonna live what you're gonna say what you're gonna wear what you're gonna eat we didn't have to decide any of that when we lived him he was our home he was our very existence so he gave us something to wear right he nurtured us he's called the many breasted one he took care of us the whole time we were with him it says that in the Bible that just meant that he would comfort us he would hold us he would love us it does say that in the Bible depending on translation you get some of the newer ones I don't know what for if it says that or not but it does say that about him no matter how your father your physical one treated you on this earth he is your real father so your soul is very key to your very existence most of the time I grew up in church think I was born there practically we went every meeting we had in the churches that we attended and and I learned a lot I listened a lot I learned a lot but they never really told me what my soul was for except that it was not good almost every statement made it's dark man designs and desires bad things and things and bad things and well maybe if they choose that they do you know to a five-year-old don't know how darker could be and I would sit there on that pew and this is what I would think how could they say that I meet from God I'm light I carry light how can my soul be bad they just don't know something they just don't know this is at five I would think about those things my soul has to be good Jesus lives in it cuz I got born again 84 well no my souls not bad my cell no I think on the things of God No mine is not we need to find out why our solace for it's got to be important he didn't make spare parts and if they say it's my mind my will and my emotions that pretty much I could do nothing without it so he decided to literally show me and in 2010 he caught me up to heaven show me this is a human soul and the very core of your being is your will it looks like a column it is a column it's a strong column with writings on it that God Himself wrote on before he sent you here he wrote things on it no man can literally say and mean it that there is no God they lie or they don't know but they cannot say that or even really convince yourself even atheists when they get saved say I always knew there was something he wrote on your will and then attached to that will is your mind not your human brain your human brain is just kind of wrapped around that mind because when you die you still think when you step out of that physical body and you're in your spirit body you think you have emotions you make choices you'd be pretty bored in heaven if you couldn't your soul goes with you your body gets separated your soul stays with your spirit man you have your favorite places in heaven you have your favorite foods in heaven so that soul stays with you all the time it just fed all day long your physical body gets fed three times day unless you like to snack a lot in foreign countries eat twice a day America its three times with dessert and snacks but your spirit man your soul is sped all day long and if you play stuff at night it's fed at night what are you feeding you everything you see everything you hear everything you read and what you say yourself you feed other people's souls when you say certain things your into them I'm I'm feeding you everybody's soul right now your soul is taking it in you have layers in your soul it gets stored in there if there's ever anything you really forgot you need to remember just tell God that I need my soul I need to know from the files of my soul I need that I need that I said it till one time and in front of me sitting in my desk I needed a little scrap of paper pastor had written his name and phone number down he was gonna invite me to come and I lost it but I looked at it first I had read it looked at it read I knew the same shape and size of that piece of paper and it was stored in my soul this was like 2 years later when I can't find it I need it I know they want me to comment on one thing I'm ignoring them and when I said ok see my soul show it to me in front of me came this piece of paper out in the spirit it literally it literally just like this came out like this and I could see it it was the same piece of paper I had looked at because it's stored in you and he said write it down cleric it's gonna go back in there so get my pen I am writing as fast as I can I was so excited it didn't go like this flip flip now that is wonderful if it's something good but if you have horrible traumas that is also stored in your soul people get tormented for years about the things they had to witness or see it wasn't even anything they had to do with you don't have to keep it anything in your soul you don't want you loose it with the keys to the community you know what that says write the keys of the kingdom what you loose on earth does that mean you're going to keep it if you loose it nope and we always thought the keys at the kingdom wants to bind the devil they do a lot of things actually but what I was taught for the father that day was how to get stuff out of your soul whether it was addictions any kind of addiction trauma violent acts words that were said that you don't wanna remember those words they hurt they wound wounds out of your soul it doesn't matter what it is witchcraft practice against you it's gone gone gone angry hateful words offense and forgetting us gone God said I don't have six months for people I don't have six months for them to be healed anymore you can lose spirits of infirmity sickness and disease from your soul and it's gone and I just happened to glance in my clock and then he caught me up to heaven and he showed me the human soul then he started telling me one thing after another for another they can lose Cistus this assists this this this all this stuff all this stuff all this stuff they can choose to loose it and it we can't take it out remember it's loosed from heaven then you bind the things of God to your soul and this really changes how you live you think and you act you can actually say and now I choose with my will to bind to my soul the life of God the love of God the presence of God the plans and purposes of God from my life his creativity his celebration his expectation you get so filled with God and no one can take it out it's part of that abundant life and it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter how long ago you experienced things you can even lose things from your children Souls if they're not adults yet we've already had testimonies there's people being in the congregations you lay your hand on their head as the covering of their soul I chooses my will to lose from my child so every bit of the bullying that they Oaks means all the hateful mean disgusting vile critical words spoken over my child I choose to lose them from their soul right now haven't come down pulls them out it's like it never happened and kids go on happy like it never happened instead of being affected sometimes for a very long time like if you try out for something and you reject it sometimes it hurts children just loose it we have kids are doing on their own we have 10 year olds that command armies up from heaven because they didn't argue about doing it those 10 year olds are certainly not worshiping their commanding what do they do they command them to go to their school and protect every student there to stop all violence from coming into their zoo to pull down strongholds of Satan rising against the school too potent on strongholds trying to convince them that there's something different than they are you choose that's why he gave you a will that's why he will not control people Satan controls he'll be happy to take your will and do whatever he wants to with it and if you put enough of him in it you're gonna act like him is that right you choose with yourself who are you going to serve you choose each day am I going to choose life or death there's a lot of that going on in this election and a lot of people are choosing death that's not God God wants us to live and live more abundantly amen tomorrow night I'll be talking about America and Trump 2020 [Music] [Applause] but God has told me I think he knows amen he on purpose has chosen America to be a pattern that even other government leaders of other countries can choose to pattern their ways after America I remember I travel a whole lot in 2017 and I would meet up people from all over the world I never knew never met them they'd all come up to me and say you must be an American you have pink hair we don't have that here but we want to know what do you think about your president because what we've been hearing on the news we cannot possibly believe it could be true but he's already visited our country and encouraged our leaders we already know that business is booming in America we know he's creating jobs for that country we hope our leader becomes just like him but we want to know what do you think I said well I think 80percent of America loves him that's why they voted him in and by the way stop watching CNN I think the fake news doesn't like us either and I'd have these long discussions with these people never knew and these were like medical doctors I mean really leaders in their own community and it probably did from eight different countries and they all asked me the same thing and they got the same answer so God still has big plans for America you think he's wrapping things up in ten years I don't think so we are just learning to operate and levels of authority that were given to us by Jesus Christ we're just learning to really take authority over the weather because we're over it not under it if we're just learning this why would you wrap everything up this is what God says I will not have a weak pathetic testimony of my son's death and all he gave you I'm not taking anybody anywhere until they're operating like him so why do we do all this everything we do we do because of him we do it with him because of him and for him we're light in this world so if you wonder who to vote for someone who doesn't represent the darkness that does not represent death that cares about what's going on in this world or especially their country and God certainly cares about it he cares about everyone but but we were willing the body of Christ is willing to help God is that right they worshiped him they loved him they honor him what he wants they're willing to do the majority are willing they just don't know what to do some of them and since before pastors weren't allowed to give any help now they are of course you did design the Internet that bypasses everything so God has great plans and the next thing I'm going to show you is really the first time on planet Earth this has ever been done and the father said I'm going to ask you to do something I want it done right away he said I'm going to mark the year that I released for the first time the faces of the hosts of heaven to humanity he said I want you to put them in a calendar you're gonna call it the hosts undercover he said they'd better undercover for a long time but now they won't be because he's serious about crushing hell he does have he has a defined time when time will be no more if you want to know what that means I can tell you that means there'll be no more time to count days and there were no limit to space like in heaven there can be 10 things right here there's layers in heaven so the comet on many earths when time will be no more he will not need this physical and even when that happens it won't be a date it will be an event because God counts things by events the time just happens to fall in every time he does something he does it because of an event so on his timeline he measures his timeline by events that's how he does it so there'll be a certain event at one point when that happens he won't need this earth anymore there will be a new earth made the Bible talks about it some people don't want to even admit that day I don't know what this thing is are afraid to leave it I guess seriously there are whole groups now saying there is we'll just be remade or keeping it I don't think that's scriptural there isn't any they just think he's gonna make it all better it wouldn't be able to hold what he's got playing for us in the new earth you couldn't have put it the new earth will be so huge the very fact that the New Jerusalem will sit on that the earth this earth would go whoop just put this in just with the New Jerusalem honor okay what's that that's God's transport down to the new work that's what it is he's packing up leaving his own home he's always had leaving heaven one day because we will stay in his home for a temporary time when you die and move to heaven that your RNR you get a beautiful mansion you get to do things you never thought of before it's R&R for that place because God intends fully at one time when time as know where he's gonna take all of us and it by belonging to him that we are his put us on a brand new earth and he will pack up his bags get on the New Jerusalem and it will be his transport we will be down here waiting on the new earth for him we will see him coming these are real things that are talked about in the Word of God but people are so stuck where they're at they don't know how much further they can go so they don't really know where they are so they go to what they know they all talk about the tribulation they talk about the Rabb they don't know they talk about doom and gloom because you know the tribulation is doom and gloom right heaven isn't heaven doesn't give you a funeral somebody please have a party when their loved ones go home because that's what they're having in heaven they don't get a funeral in heaven they get a party it's called a celebration the Bible says he celebrates every time one comes home that is a celebration that's a lot different than the funeral it's a funeral would fun after you end so I'm going to show you this we have some back there I don't know how many we have but we're going to give this one to Dave and Dee Dee so they'll make sure they get one he had us create this it was definitely a supernatural thing because I have about 400 pictures of the hosts he actually sent them to me to get pictures of them it if there were a lot of them I took pictures if this is the thing if you didn't want them shown they they collapsed the picture did it was like no definition that's just a flat nothing and I began I said well what's wrong with this one he said no I don't want you to keep that one I'll get another one so perfectly sharp and clear he said you're gonna keep that one I didn't know it was keeping them to make this calendar we're gonna put them on a lot of other things cuz they will inspire you and empower you to know these guys are real and their greatest passion is to war against the darkness they didn't cry when Lucifer was kicked out the day Michael cried Gabriel Michael didn't try they had a party because they were fed up with Lucifer going around tempting their own friends to fall picture in your town and how did God deal with evil he kicked it out he didn't tolerate it he didn't make a place for it he didn't say it's okay you're different he kicked it out he didn't want it there he didn't want to filing heaven anymore it will never be allowed back he is not going to forgive Satan and he is not going to forgive one fallen angel they live with him they got one chance it's up soz about these guys in the unit on the front cover is a being I know I didn't not like this one on purpose sometimes we outlined them to help you in the corner we would show a being like this one then down here we just outlined it in case you couldn't tell because spiritual beings are made different the army especially they don't have a hand like this all of them don't some have a head they have more than one eye or they have one big eye guess what else I cops thing came from the enemy will take anything you can that balloons of God and twist it and defile it he will now Medusa that was his own creation but there's a lot of beings in heaven there's many beings that have like a horse body and beautiful you know there's them is very beautiful they're not evil Satan took the image and made it evil so I'm gonna show you a couple of the pages now this one's very easily seen this is a real fire angel made out of guess what fire and he's a spirit she she's all spiritual being his arms don't come from his shoulders they come from his chest this is his arm this is his whole arm coming out of his body this is his head if you could look at this closer you could see his eyes his nose his mouth this is his wings right here his hair his wings he is walking on legs do you see the legs he's walking on the river in our city and in his hand he's carrying a deposit of the fire of God his name is Inferno and gentes picture it was right after our National Day of Prayer and all the wild intercessors got on a riverboat we wrote up a nun our st. Johns River and we would drop salt in the water salting it and we said on purpose this is to make way to cleanse the water for the fire of God to come and then God sent it so about a month later after that event he showed up on the river we were going over to visit my sister on the other side of the river and he said don't go the way you normally go go this other way or you're gonna miss what I'm gonna send in the sky she's a photographer I'm driving I have to say Jen took this picture I took a lot of them but she did take this one and we were we are miles dropped off when we came over we were on the Express system we came over this part down under where this is this bridge is three miles long as a three mile long bridge that connects to the other side of our city he was walking on the water not not standing he was we got about eight pictures of him and he was kind of white then he started getting more and more fire in him and people were going crazy they were pulling over I mean many pictures got this people got this picture so this is this was one of not the very first one but one of the best that was in 2009 and so I'll show you another one we'll have them back there now these are all army members these are not any of gabriel's I don't have any pictures of Gabriel's I've drawn them I painted them I don't have any pictures god I'm purpose connecting me to the army and so I'll show you another one just kind of passing around here some of them if you ever see something the sky looks like a dragon it's an Eragon they belong to heaven if God told me their name I know what their name is this one right here is there's a whole group there angels are made in tribes both on Gabriel side the first tribes were hid in heaven they weren't angels he made them in tribes because they had a defined purpose every tribe had a defined purpose and this one is the guardian angel over the state of New York his name is Excalibur can you see his face very clearly in the back can you see it oh thank you yeah he looks like a lion you see his mouth up and you can see his Mane yeah he's part of the tribe of the Royal Guard they all look like lions you've seen a lot of lines in the sky it was these guys right here and they do look like they look like lions and they guard the Royals because you are kings and priests into your God so that is their defying purpose they come to guard those who will rule and reign with Christ so that's that's the Royal Guard I also have ones that transport troops from heaven at pictures of the troops of heaven have pictures of one that goes into as covert and he he videotapes the actions of darkness and he goes right up to Michael's throne Michaels building he has one eye okay this is this is that angel its name is scout because he's a scout he goes behind the lines you should be able to see the one big eye it's right here you see a mark on that angel see that mark next to his eye it's a mark like a tattoo God marks the enemy stole it that's God's thing he marks them with different marks and this one right here is literally going like this looking and watching activities of Hell's army who are clueless to what they're doing they are absolutely clueless and so he's standing in a cloud in his wings or other army members of the hosts to protect them from any attacks of the enemy and so God has really good plans so this is a scout host of hosts of heaven with one eye right here if you could see a close you could literally see a face on the eye it records and this is something he asked us to create we didn't choose to do it ourselves I'm gonna show you another one oh we actually entry on here like here a roll up your Raptor rug and roll up you're out for rock and in here we have things like don't forget to ask for grace for today and then we have special days we put a special days in here we don't have Halloween so sorry we took it out we took liberties we don't have holidays from other false religions either so get used to it and so then we put statements at the bottom each the Holy Spirit gave us you must choose to be chosen you know that thing God many are called but few are chosen is because they didn't choose to be chosen you choose it you choose to be chosen this one is one of the best ones we have his name is Rex yeah it's it's me do you see his face he looks like a lion he's high up in the command of the Royal Guard really high up he's got wings that come from his neck my son-in-law likes to say he has horns and I want one no he didn't really have horns those are wings and I can't do this as well so my turn around this is one wing and this is another one and there's eyes lining there's eyes in all these wings eyes he has the eye on the end of his beard this is his moustache can you see his moustache it's long isn't that people say do angels have beards and mustaches the answer is yes you can see them right here he's holding a scroll on his hand can you see the scroll this is the scroll has a face it's a living scroll his name is Justus that scroll was dropped inside of me I had to say yes because I was said during the time when when we would command and the scrolls name is Justus and God said that he would read himself to me would that bother you've got to ask you that what would you say that's well I actually had to say yes my husband was with me somebody who never sees angels he's got five layers of a soul he's Scottish he's like a mountain he can't be moved anywhere he just belong to Jesus but he was with me when this beam came in over five storeys of condos and when spiritual beings come in the physical realm they flatten they come in and then they open up we have pictures of him flattened coming in we had pictures of him fully open we have pictures of him just waiting and then I asked the Holy after I got nuns screaming and yelling my husband's like oh something's coming in that was his whole statement something's coming in I'm like I'm excited I'm so excited wonder what he's here for a wonder what he wants and so I saw the spirit what is he here for was he's got orders from headquarters during the army from heaven for you to command and I said what I do he says you have to say I receive the scroll so I said I received it he dropped it and went inside of me and I said well whatever do he said nothing it'll read itself to you scrolls in heaven books in heaven read themselves to you so this is normal for heaven this is what happens when you live supernatural this is what happens when you choose to live the way God designed you to be amen and so we have heard him say one word and there's another picture after this I don't have that with me but after he dropped the scroll out of this this rift this deep blue is heaven right there that's heaven and when I said yes and you dropped inside of me out of these came two more beings one had a shofar one had a trumpet they began to blow them because God was signifying something the earth was going to command the army and so that's what that signified if I had said no it might have changed things or he would have found someone else I wasn't willing to do that amen so I have that picture you literally see these beings one looks very ancient he's got a long beard his eyes a rectangle and he's got a shofar the other one has a trumpet trumpet he's just got like a big like a I can't remem what you call those things capes or woods whatever you want to call that he had something like that and they were there celebrating then they were gone like that so we had a very little time I said I'm taking pictures I don't know about you I'm taking pictures to get some pictures of it so this is what's in this calendar and every month it has something to encourage you and the hosts make toast may the hosts go with you we say that to people all the time stand up stand out be dangerous against hell but this is not your normal calendar okay and over here what we know about that being we will tell you if we know something about it right there will tell you and and on the back he had us actually we couldn't hide who we are I said you're gonna show who you are so this is about a company one quest international tells you what it is there's me there's Margaret and then we have another page you said you're also going to show the creative team I sent all this through so people know who helped to create it because I don't do everything by myself there I am there's our our very funny English guy there's Jan okay in about two weeks we had it done do you ever work in any kind of marketing or creating that's that's definitely that's a heaven thing we stayed up we traveled we worked on it in the hotel room the hardest part was was picking out we just put all these pictures out everywhere we took them with us and then and God gave us what to say push back darkness I mean this whole thing is about God it's all about heaven it's about God's time on the earth and there's a there's others so there's one for each month in here and people go what the years have to over yet but they're not done this is about a time it's about a time like God counts event by events this is an event that God had picked scrolls were literally open and heaven unlocked and open so the host could work with us to fulfill their destiny that they were created to war for us so that's my introduction and we will have some back there if we if we know the name some look pretty fierce but these guys war you think about they war just like a military they're warring for you they fight for you literally for you for your family they'll keep the darkness as long as you're not bringing in your home they'll keep it out of your home amen and so these are some of our products our cups this is just our book cover of book 1 that's what that is and eventually we'll have whole sets of cups made like with some of the hosts on them that you can get you can go to revealing heaven dot-com and they'll all be on all those will be online yeah our phone numbers on our website you can call it if you can't find something you can call it and so um yeah our events are planned for specific purposes that we have our own there to train people to be prepared to be a part of a move of God like we have for the first time we're going to be training whether Warriors at our event at the end this next weekend actually it's called heavens invitation and we've had every year since we've been going and now we're adding weather warriors as one of the whole days to be trained how do you train how you learn too because you know Jesus already knew all that when he was asleep in the boat he already knew he could do that he was hoping the disciples would learned from him and yet what did they do there they're in terror for their own life there's a lord of glory on the boat with him and he's sleeping I'm sure you wanted to say why didn't you handle it when he learned to multiply the food he was training them the whole time why didn't you multiply food we can go and buy it we can't fine well why didn't you multiply it I mean disciples he wanted them to learn what he did why don't you traveling through the spirit realm will fill up God it Philip did as a lifestyle it was so normal for him he just did it you don't try it you do only purpose and focus and you keep doing it and something is going to happen and he doesn't care if you're ninety nine or nine it's what you choose what you decide you want but wherever you don't don't reject it sometimes it's Jesus just taught them something he didn't say what do you want this or not he just did it it's up to you if you do it or not amen and this new time we're living in the earth where we will demonstrate the power of the Living God we're not waiting on that time we're in that time you weren't here the last time I was here I just got back from Reno where I walked on the air who wants to do that be passionate about it I didn't even walk on water first I know Jesus said the books I did you will do and greater works you will do I jumped right into the greater works you know why that happened because I was violently passionate about something I had just hit my foot under stone and I roared this should not have happened to me I will not tolerate this again your word says that the angels will catch me up so I don't even - my foot on a stone I will never do that again and so next the week after I'm in Reno and between the green room and where we were there was a drop-off this big I walked right off of it I didn't even think I didn't know I was walking in here but I had said that and this the floor of a stone that was really humor I think on their part I said it wouldn't - stop and literally I don't know if they caught me I don't know what they did I don't know what they did I just know I didn't hit it I didn't fall on it I didn't hit it my foot didn't get dashed my head didn't get - it was like so high I would have fallen my whole body would have been I just walked like it was nothing I'm just doing the father's business right the pastor's in front of me walking and talking and I'm just walking and talking behind him and gents are shelling you're floating in air and what no I'm not I had my iPad or holding my iPad and I'm just talking to the pastor she says yes you are yes you are you know I thought she was playing a joke on me or something so I just keep walking I'm walking I walked out about 6 foot she goes you are walking on air why don't you look down so I'm walking outside I went I threw my iPad and I was there for about three more seconds just so he knew I would never forget that I was walking out here and I just went down really slow I began shaking Jen we were shaking and the pastor owns what just happened jingles she was flirting and he's a really good friend he said that's awesome will you do it out in the congregation why you just walk off that platform sweetie I want you to walk out that place son the whole time I'm when I first looked down and went wow it was this like walking on water and the father said oh no Jesus could feel the water he knew water was there didn't have anything to do but he said he could feel the water you couldn't feel the air no I couldn't say that's a greater work okay and he said well I'll get used to it until everybody they better start getting used to it everybody say I receive it this is definitely a different time we can't we can't think the same if you stay in your old mindset that's where you'll be when you either die and go to heaven or get raptured if you're gonna live for a couple hundred more years you'll probably get raptured if not then you're probably just going to go there and I've been shown a lot in the future and we're just starting into something so powerful the next 50 years will be so powerful on this very powerful I have grandchildren that are already being caught up to heaven it will be normal for children to visit heaven normal especially if their parents are believers it's gonna be normal he describes it all the time things that I've seen that I never even told him about okay he was three when it started rota volcano or the lava of a volcano with my father who lives in heaven and with Jesus huh he'd never met my father he called him grandpa but my dad looks 25 and he said and he gave me some Mary Janes he didn't know where Mary Jane was maybe somebody's you don't know either my dad's favorite candy in heaven he was giving him candy what do grandparents do they give candy so they still get to heaven he was with him and they were gonna ride this volcano and he was telling his mom all this and she said you better get over here right now get over here I said what did you expect what's gonna happen and so he's telling me all this Indy goes you know what and a three year old would not know even how a volcano was well he said there was lava it was red it was like kind of burning like and he said you know this mount was really cool grandpa took us straight up the side of the mountain no wheels on his car we we just kind of glided up to the top in the mountain we jumped off and went inside the volcano he said you know what my mom he said that would have burned anybody else to death but because of my god we didn't burn we wrote on and it was a fun ride and he you know what he's seven now and it hasn't stopped he'll preach to anybody anything he talks to his army he asked for grace every day and he looses stuff from his soul they don't ever have meltdowns in their car because as soon as they can talk she teaches him how to ask for credits this is our life this is this is our life this is how we're supposed to be living we're not from this world we live here worse we'll be acting like the world we come from amen so it's already starting it's already starting you know I have three daughters they see they hear I told them they had two and they're a girl might you won't sin because you don't get a choice I'm not letting you guys not letting you he said he needed holy seed in this earth and I gave up myself to get married and have you hi this is their conversation when they're little just looking at me I expect you to do greater things than I do and my grandchildren will be even greater so you will have nine children [Laughter] people don't tell you kiss him it's better than the screaming telling there'll be nothing in their dumb they never thought they were that they never thought they were those things and if someone told me they said oh no I'm not I belong to Jesus Christ one day when we had everything we owned taken away from us not our fault thrown out of our home we packed everything up we picked our kids up in a moving van and my daughter who is 16 said to me what an adventure with God I cannot wait to see what is he gonna do with us I am so excited she's 16 raise him up in the admonition of the Lord train them up in the gifts that God gave them and they'll never depart from those gifts the advance had never stopped they never ran in the world I'm serious never ran in the world trying to figure out who they were they knew they were dancers that was what he made them it was their passion from the time they were three four and eight that's all they ever did they didn't want to be something else they knew they were a gift sent from heaven and that's the gift they were every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of you were those lights why would he say that why would he put that in the same thing why would he say that together every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights you were the lights your spare man's made out of light you were a gift he sent you it's not that hard that's God to give you revelation I want you to enjoy your life I want you to celebrate your life you choose every day to be happy you're not happy there's no excuse to not be happy you don't have to keep that junk in you so stand up we're gonna do it I know you've done it again we're gonna do it i'ma pray over you and I'm gonna let you go amen I know there's new people here if you don't know about a soul checkup it's a lifestyle it is a lifestyle it will keep you so full of God so happy so inspired it opens up portals of heaven over you you get witty ideas and inventions you can even share it with others to help them because you have a will you can do this you have a soul he gave it to you you decide to use it or not using I'm not forcing anyone you say yes or no you do it or you don't do it it's really easy because almost everything God ever gave us is some he talks to me like I'm eight he doesn't give me big words he doesn't give me any long you know any long definitions on stuff he keeps it really simple that's why eight-year-olds can read my book and if they follow me and they come to a meeting they won't want their own they don't want to share it with their parents and their parents we'll play there's over 400 hours of me speaking on YouTube a lot of them played me all night long and those kids love it they wander no truth they want to know who God is no one can tell them there's something else because what you fill yourself with you will become amen so this is so simple you're gonna choose with your will to do this first you're gonna choose and say I choose my will to lose from my soul and then I'll give a list of most things that people have in their souls if I don't say something you can say it yourself you can also lose soul ties you made with other people that didn't treat you nice so good you can loose them from your soul then when we're all done because I see Jesus come down and he pulls things out of you literally it's like grey matter he pulls it out and then you bind things of God and they come in waves each thing you say it comes in a wave and I feel it go through me and through everybody here like the love of God the life I feel it comes like a wave so here we go are you ready you say as a child of God I choose with my will to lose from my soul all anger and wrath all hate all critical harsh judgmental words whether they were spoken to me or I spoke them I choose to lose from my soul all witchcraft whether I watched it read it or practiced it or anyone practice it around me I loose it i loosed from my soul all addictions from a person a place or a thing I will not keep any of them they will no longer control me in any way I loose from my soul any in all violence whether I watched it whether I read it whether I spoke it or someone spoke to me I also lose all traumas whether I experience violence or abuse of any kind or a witnessed it I loose all of it in Jesus name I loose from my soul all sadness all oppression depression and all despair any suicidal thoughts I loose them all in Jesus name I loose from my soul all sickness or disease are spirits of infirmity anything that is terminal in my body all emotional pain physical pain or mental pain I loose it all in Jesus name I loose from my soul all confusion any confusion any strife of any kind I will not keep it I lose from my soul all fear of any kind I will not be fearful in any way at least from my soul any lack any poverty mentality any mishandling of money I loose it from my soul I loose it from my soul all darkness I will not participate I will not tolerate and I will not advertise darkness of any kind at least from my soul and also ties there were negative abusive critical hateful or controlling I sever them and loose them from myself and Jesus name I list from my soul any books of other religions I will not keep them in myself I will not allow them to control my will my mind our my emotions no matter how long it's been since I read them or if others read them to me if I attended places that taught false religions I will not participate with an antichrist spirit I lose from my soul and you know deception whether I took it or gave it out I will not take it or keep it I loose it from myself in Jesus name I declare it amen amen and [Music] so now I choose with my will to bind to my soul the love of God the life of God the presence of God the peace of God the celebration of God the creativity of God the expectancy of God I bind those to my soul happiness joy everlasting I bind those to my soul and Jesus name Amen amen amen father I thank you for your children tonight god I thank you for those who received you knows who may not have received I thank you that these words that they have listened to are already in their soul I think you remind them day and night what was said to them what you said to them what your plans are for them what time it is God don't ever let them forget that I thank you God that you chose them you sent them here you have plans for them that greatness rise up in them an excitement and celebration and Jesus name I thank you for blessing them when they lie down tonight get in sweet dreams show them dreams of their destiny catch them up to heaven let them have encounters father you're no respecter of persons I thank you that you love all of us very dearly so let your presence remain with them forever I thank you Father amen praise

the deepest desire of everyone here in this house is that you have a personal encounter with god tonight that he speaks to you personally that he touches your heart and you get to see and hear him in a new and special way tonight and so that's why they want special ed to say that to you so we have some protocols for it if you came with somebody you know obviously it doesn't we don't want to tell you you can't pray for your family or anything like that but here's what we do ask if it's not someone you know or someone you came with we ask that you do not pray for other people we have special team fire team you'll notice people throughout the house with tags like this fire team tags we want to minister to you and these are people who have been specially annoyed especially chosen within the house so they can pray with you and pray for you if you have a need seek someone out we're more than happy to minister to you after service will probably be the ones to be ministering to you but we just don't want to have everybody ministering to everybody because we want to make sure you're guarded we want to make sure that that's done in a special way and it's done with an anointed in presence of the house and what god's doing here tonight so we ask that you do that again when we let our hair down and do this you're welcome to come up and worship and really let it go uh wash the flaggers you know anyone slain in the spirit with a flagpole but we'll pray for you if it happens and you'll be okay all right so tonight's gonna be a glorious night god's got something special you can just

win this is a part of time appointed by me from heaven earth this night i light a flame on the top of this mountain it will never be put off for you have stood to adversity through the lies to the accusations through the control the demands of man you have worshipped me you have not forgotten my son you have not forgotten what he's done you will be blessed and you will never stop being blessed for i am the god of everybody and the god of everything i'm about to shake this earth great exposure of the darkness matter what people or the fake news or the lying liberals have said about me or this time they don't know anything [Music] if they do not stop they will lose everything their words will become dust and blown away like they were never there for i say this is a time of greatness of acceleration you've never known are the manifested sons and daughters to come forth to demonstrate to manifest my power my love my plans the devil has plans he will fail and he will lose again and again and again and again and again and again [Music] for i have already said i will be in the white house for 24 years there is no one on this earth in this earth under this earth that can stop it from happening for i will have these days on the earth the great days the great days of knowing there is a god that he speaks that he sears sees and hears if my prophets do not prophesy what i say they will not have a voice until that season is over for these are not the days of doom and gloom these are not the days of the rapture the perilous times the tribulation they're times of greatness of the fire and the glory sweeping over this earth touching everyone crushing the darkness and pushing it back for i am cleaning the stage wiping it clean are the enemies camp are the enemy's people are the enemies dust [Music] for i will have my way my son made a way i will not ignore what he has done and i will not have a weak pathetic testimony of his sacrifice no one says when he is coming back but me and i am not ready for i will set you on fire and you will demonstrate like no one has before in all of history the powerful things of god to speak to the land the sea in the air and it will move do not tolerate evil and do not participate with it you choose life or death because they're apparently out there right now always choose life for when you side with those who want death of the unburned you will never win you will never succeed or complete your destiny you will repent because i bring life and life abundantly but you must choose it and if you choose it you must live it get out of the gray area stop riding on the fence for i hear those who've humbled themselves whose heart cries out for more but this time you get to bring them more i said it would be my sons and daughters who did it there is no age for them whether it's three or 153 you choose for if you sit on the side and do nothing that's what you will have a boring life an unfruitful life be bold and step out let people know what you believe and who you believe they'll come beating your door down to find out about your god not the false gods who have no life not the lies of the enemy he thinks he can take my country for it is mine i created it i called it into being i had people fight for it and die for it in the seasons past you've died to live for me but it now you will live and not die if you choose was it what is it to you if i keep you until my son returns be strong be excited and celebrate the victory even before it happens [Music] do not listen to the doom and gloom that does not come from me but fearful hearts that don't know what time it is they don't know what my plans are and they want to escape run your race but run it with me for i'll be right beside you and i will open the eyes of many and they will see me and they will know their god those who have stood and been faithful even under attack even though things were taken from you do you not think i can give you a hundred times more than what you had it is my desire to bless you it is my desire to be with you for there are times there are only in the power of my hand and these are some of those times listen to what is true where there is no confusion and nothing hidden don't believe the lies of those who live in sin and say they live and speak for me some have removed from the earth [Music] i won't allow their testimony of who i am to be here many who are lying cheating and stealing and even killing will lose not just their state but their life this is a holy time but it is a time to celebrate heaven celebrates with this time live on earth like they live in heaven but you have to be willing and obedient the host will not listen to those to be commanded by those who do not speak the words of my son nor have him in their heart not just as their savior but as their king many kings will come forth in this time for my son is the king of spiritual kings and the lord of spiritual lords and the spirit there is no difference between male nor female both can rise to that position of authority and dominion but you have to pursue it [Music] and if you want my thoughts you better walk in my ways and you better say his will his way not his will man's way i'm about to consume this country and people will come here to find me not just the american dream some regions the light and the glory will be so great in people will drive their dead relatives in there they'll come to life neither sin nor crime nor sickness will be able to abide in those regions [Music] you are forerunners it is an honor and a privilege to be chosen if you're alive and you're breathing and you've given yourself to my son you are chosen know this night that your god has visited you and spoken his words to you if they don't light up with others then do not receive those words for i stand on my work and beside my son on my throne these are days we have talked about before you were ever born before the earth was made we spoke of these days why would i give them up if you buy a bible and it says it's my word and it's left parts out don't read it if it makes it easy to live to freely sin there's other gods beside me that can bring you to my home those are lies from hell for my word and my truth will make you free says your god a man [Music] [Music] oh can you hear me now [Music] i know there are people who will tell you that you cannot see the faces of god and live but even the one who spoke those words and they were written in the word saw the face of god john himself in the book of john said you cannot see the face of god and live but in the book of revelation in chapter 4 he was caught up he was in the spirit that's a place you walk in he's in a place on that day where he could hear no word of man on the isle of patmos at least that day unless he decided to walk off of it i chose to let him see things are different because he was in that place i could catch him up and stand before my throne with the living rainbow moving in and out of me with life moving in and out of me and he saw my face and never again after that did he say you cannot see the face of god and live for i have caught many up and showed many my face my plans but this one standing before you she is my revelator i will never stop taking her to heaven what business is it to you if i want to i held the air you breathe if i choose somebody who's been willing and obedient and laid down their life every time i asked why would i not trust her yes she's a woman and she's a king in the spirit she's not just my servant she is my daughter and it is my great pleasure to reveal her as my treasure to operate without measuring these days [Music] if you're willing to pay the price you think it's so easy to have to live a halfway normal life on this earth when you're so connected to me in heaven she does not see things like you see them but she will reveal everything i show her and will not be afraid of the face of man even hell trembles when she speaks [Applause] everyone should be dangerous against hell [Music] it is evil and wickedness that tries to consume your country but i will not tolerate it for my people have humbled themselves they have repented of their wicked ways and i will heal their land [Music] for i hear everyone and i see everyone nothing is hidden from me when i look at the earth i rejoice i remember when my son and i made it we made it to kerry the glory the power the wonder a stopover station before you come home i know your trials i know your test if you fall down get up [Applause] tell the enemy you will no longer tolerate him in your life that means you will not tolerate his images his words his frequencies his songs you create a habitation for heaven in your home and it will come you will see angels coming and going for you are in a new season the season of the high call of god of your god why did you not expect for things to be exposed before every great thing was done hell always acted up but this time the exposure is for your benefit these are not new things they've always been here you just never knew it i'm pulling away every closed door basement building things hidden in the wilderness things hidden in the forest even things hidden underground i will expose it all [Applause] the lives of those those who want to stand and run your country but hate me hate life even hate the people they want to govern it will not happen [Applause] for i will shake them and nothing will be hidden but openly shown and dealt with even those have already been in power and think they've gotten away with it they will not trump may not be perfect but he gives me permission to be in this country from the highest office in the land he has welcomed me and prayed to me and made friends with my pastors my prophets my teachers my evangelist his closest friends are my sons and daughters but the world would reject them and hate them there are many people in this world praying for your president even they love him even they recognize the good in him the authority in him he will help to shift many leaders of many governments so i can shape that nation and he will sweep his platform clean one day to make room for pence i have heard words spoken against my vice president and i am not happy he is a godly man who is not afraid of anything he is a strong tower to temper your president he will win two terms also [Applause] for i have written that in my book and what my book says it will happen not maybe happen [Applause] whoever he picks to be his vice president will then be president for eight years after him by that time there'll be no opposition that will even have a voice to speak [Music] [Applause] america will be a great light to this world it is my gift to this world who allows my son my greatest gift to operate in this world get ready because the show is beginning [Applause] [Music] there's coming a day when people will step into a store thinking they're going to buy something and they will step into my glory and begin to cry out to know me [Music] satan knows about these days but he was hoping he could stop them this is a place of freedom liberty and justice for all it is also a place for righteousness and holiness that your amazing forefathers heard my voice and made plans for it the enemy has always been afraid of america don't be afraid even if you come home you'll be with me there is no fear not even in death you just step from life to life [Applause] if your family live here they're the most blessed people in existence make plans to be great because it is time for i will pour out my spirit on all flesh children will begin to pastor at age five [Applause] children are the easiest to reach because they don't question and they don't reason and they don't let their mind get involved that's why i said you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom you have not because you asked not but those who've asked already will surely get what they have asked for it is a new time on the earth a miracle will be an example but many countries will run to the light and to my son for there is a habitation coming that will not end until i say it will [Applause] end rejoice that i have shown these things and spoken to you of these things for those are my plans the more you believe it is real the more real it will become there's coming a day very soon that when you come here the glory will be waiting portals are being opened everywhere for heaven to pour in but also for blessings to pour in those who say i cannot speak through the voice of a man or mankind don't know me make sure you laugh laughter is the language of heaven but profanity is the language of hell don't let those words be in your mouth in your home allowed to enter into your home guard your soul and the souls of your children by not letting anything pass through any form of media it will be a trap of the enemy and what you've given permission to come will come if you say good morning to me every morning you'll be saying it before my throne you command the day by what you choose when you first wake up choose life and love my power my presence extreme discernment and get understanding these days will come quickly and your life will change day by day so all who hear this message if you are my son or my daughter if you have received my son and repented of your sins these words are for you do not walk around with your head held down but lift it up where your help comes from even if people laugh they will not be laughing for long term pray for those who have chosen the darkness and are expecting it to win some will take their life when they lose because their souls have been compromised by the lies they've been listening to guard well the layers of your soul what you put there and always choose life i love you says your god amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] oh it is hard to stand i won't fall i'm sure my angels are behind me i don't want a stool what is that no no but we could just lay hands on everybody and end it [Music] it's pretty pretty hard to top god and for those of you who don't think this is real may he come to you [Music] when i walked in the angel of the lord who looks just like jesus came in behind me to make sure i wouldn't fall down before i got up here and god's been speaking to me like the last several hours before i got here and some people think why is she late why is she late well are you going to turn around and say no to god i was right on time god was very wise calling me a revelator instead of a prophet because he knew all the bashers wouldn't know what a false revelator was [Music] [Applause] he was very detailed with me before i started traveling and speaking and he'd already warned me about a lot of stuff that would happen or would be said which i understand people don't understand what they don't know or they have not experienced their self it is hard for them to receive it seeing is not believing receiving is believing god has given me many titles i didn't ask for any of them and many people say i want to be you i go no you don't you don't really and i've heard people say he chose seven men before he chose you no he didn't he did choose me he knew me when i was in him he knew every one of you already knew what you would become and on your soul that he created he wrote if he would be male or female no matter how man says how that happens and your soul will be conflicted if you're told you're something else because your soul already knew what it was supposed to be but if the ones who wanted to take over have their way they would let anybody choose whatever they want to but god has a plan you were with him before you came to this earth before this world was made before he stretched out the universe the physical realm over the spiritual realm that's why when it says in revelations he will roll it up he knows where the ends are he had to put something out there that he could put physical things on because all he had the original realm is the spiritual realm the unseen realm unless he lets you see it from the time i was little i was a seer i saw the good guys and the bad guys i saw activities at the spirit realm you hear people talk about angels and demons there's much more than that all around you there's buildings built that both sides use depending on what is going around in that area there's platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places how do they get in high places they earn it by hunting for souls for the enemy these are wicked spiritual beings however when you learn to command an army that was created to pull down every stronghold of satan they're the ones who war against hell no matter what level of wickedness they operate in they can shred those platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places and they go through light buzz saws and they can't stop it from happening because we who have the flesh you're the ones who have authority in the earth every spirit would be coming from hell trying to take over they use people like they apparently are right now but they cannot do it they can't the earth is made for men and those who receive jesus christ you're called to rule in the spirit realm when you take authority and dominion in the spirit realm it then in packs and packs this physical realm and because we haven't known how to do it to his fullness satan has just taken all he wants to done what he wanted to kill who he wants to put fear in who he wants to we're not tolerating it anymore jesus clearly said the things i did you will do and greater things you will do than i did so you should be trying to stop the storms we can help you do that you can either email or call our office and ask for weather warrior information that's god's name that he gave for this group who's willing to step out and just do what his son did i didn't pick that name we are to take authority over any form of destructive weather and whether you know it or not in the word of god when he made the ocean and he made the land he told the ocean i set a boundary right here at the land and you will not pass over that's god's word that's his decree we are his sons and daughters it is our job to uphold that and tell those storms you will not cross over on the land or do destruction he created the weather to nourish the earth not to damage it so we sit down here and say god come and rescue us come and stop this and he's looking down saying i gave you authority you have authority you rule because the enemy knows he can get in and twist any of those weather system and use them the best he can because he comes to what kill steal destroy and one of the ways he does that is with the weather so our volcanoes are not supposed to be erupting tsunamis are not supposed to be destroying none of that stuff that's going on but there's been no voice or agreement in the body that they would no longer tolerate that he taught the disciples how to multiply food how to travel in the spirit realm how to take authority and dominion over all the power of the darkness cast out any and all demons to pray for the sick to be healed why are we tolerating the virus because i'm not it has no right here the body needs to wake up stand up and step out you can wake up all you want to he wants you to do all of those things and i can tell you right now the meteorologists don't know what's happening they're going wild we even have some of their briefings where they talked about what is wrong with this weather they're almost afraid to give a forecast of anything because it never happens and then they faked it they faked it to prove these things were happening those weren't even the storm that was going on those in the area that the storms are headed to have the greatest authority if you're a believer so those on the east coast we have melt we have built a wall and if you go back and look at every storm that's come after dorian when we told it we all started saying you will not and cannot cross over the boundaries god set for you and all the way down not just in florida where we started it all the way up the east coast believers were standing there saying you will not cross over and do destruction and every time a storm comes you can go look at it it comes a certain way then it hits the wall and goes back out and they don't understand it's simply the body of christ taking authority so when we learn oh hawaii has got it down we have a lot of friends there's a lot of weather warriors that live in hawaii it doesn't even get started before they get out there and they start i'll never forget the time that this massive like i think was category five was coming and i had been teaching and talking to him about taking authority and we all declared that this storm will not be allowed to come ashore and the head of it would be taken off and when everyone went to bed except me because i don't sleep at night when they all went to bed when they woke up there was nothing but shreds left and they couldn't understand or get it they knew for sure that the the island would be consumed and those people those weatherboards in hawaii would not let up that prayer of agreement we had they said we don't know how it happened but it looks like the head was taken these are the meteorologists saying this the head was taken right off [Music] it was a nothing and one reporter said never in 25 years of being a meteorologist i ever see i never saw that happen i'm still trying to go back over all the tapes all the information that we've accumulated to know exactly what should have happened and it didn't happen why because they're not tolerating it so whoever lives in the gulf better start stepping up is not coming to florida i live there and i'm not putting up with it anymore [Applause] you need to just get fed up what yes whoever has the fires in your state you better start saying you're not tolerating it anymore you come into low pressure system to form and come in and put the fires out [Applause] that is not something new in the bible they called forth rain to come and they begin to see the clouds form did it come and did it rain why are we any different than them it's called believing your faith and guess what in heaven you'll need your faith not to pay your rent not to be healed not for any of those things but to begin to create who is our father do you know in the bible when it says let us make men in our image that's what they look like like with the glory on them the light of god on them but after our likeness is how they operate we're supposed to operate like them we are not god you don't want to be god i don't want to be god i've seen a lot but i still don't want to be god no one's that many kids the devil actually isn't god's problem it's how we all pray and stand against them he should be running does it say he will run from us do you remember that scripture you submit yourself under the hand of god and resist the enemy what will he do he will flee from you he's talking to you you do you know the word resist doesn't go oh no no i don't know what there's something i will not tolerate you you're a liar and a friar and i serve the most high god only him and he'll run there are people the demons beg not to be assigned to because when they come back and they're not successful with their assignment they get punished the devil doesn't give anybody rewards not even his own he just punishes them when they don't listen so they don't want to they'll lie they'll do anything they can they don't want to and by the way when you learn to release the anointing they burn on and it hurts they'll burn if they get near the fire of god it will burn them like it's going to melt them they may live in hell's fire they don't want god's fire that's why baptism in fire is coming [Applause] see i was raised on the word of god god chose when my birth would happen on this earth he chose my fathers my mothers by the way my mother is here tonight she'll be 90 next april she had 15 children i am number three and my sister's number 15 right there and any of them could testify to anything i am saying i never was normal i didn't want to speak to people even though i was i didn't want to speak to people i didn't want to hug them i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you know my little nice apartment somewhere and do big business he took me out of my world of business yeah it's like he didn't know he needed paychecks seriously he did this he always told me before he would do something with me my grandmother was my dad's mother was a powerful woman of god she was in the jungles of panama and was afraid of nothing ever she'd come to our home on sabbatical i mean we had more kids than anybody she could have come any anywhere i don't remember she had eight or nine of her own our aunts and uncles so she had a lot of children but she always came to our house because god was there we knew she could see through the walls we knew she could see right inside of us and every time she came she'd lay her hand on her head you will serve and know the most high god and my brother would run and hide i'm not going to be a missionary and be eaten by the alligators or crocodiles no right now they lock them on death row to minister to death apprentice prisoners he's invited by hell's angels to come and do funerals i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles anymore my mom would tell me every day you are so strange i don't know what god's going to do with you i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day my whole life i would know things my siblings didn't care too much for that my dad was a great mentor but his own mother in the jungles of panama on her own they had a murderer loose in the village i know some of you heard the story before but it just shows you who she was she was on the mission field in the little hut somewhere where she was ministering and she i think she lived there for i forgot how many years many years and everybody was boarding up their windows to keep this murder from out she left her window open and she went to sleep right in front of the window because guess what she knew god sure enough late at night here comes a foot in the window and this huge machete coming with him and she turn around look at him and she goes freeze in jesus name and rolled over and went back to sleep and three hours later when the police arrived he was still frozen [Applause] that was my grandmother i was taught to never be afraid i knew there was a god i knew there was his son i knew there was holy spirit who is my best friend that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a day that's what that means let me speak to you 24 hours a day but lots of times he's tweaking you he wouldn't warn me something's going to happen i don't think i'd do that that's what he says to me i don't think i'd go there so i'm not going to go there okay i don't ask him why but you have to have your ears open to listen and it's really good idea if you say i choose holy spirit to give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention it is one of the most powerful things you can say anybody here let's just say it together holy spirit from this moment on i give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention so be it there you did it i did that when i was really young it saved me a lot let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen she'd come up here now she would preach all the time she knows that's true because he does the same thing with her every morning it's called living a new life heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a lifestyle so if you want to live on earth as they live in heaven you need to learn to live heaven culture what is that how they live in heaven and living the same way on the earth they're free of fear free of lack free of grief free of anything of the enemy never sick they go well they're in heaven yes they are but our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come by the way that is heaven your kingdom is heaven you're speaking to the father right your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven that is heaven culture you are literally praying a prayer that asks for heaven culture and he's released it on the earth you choose it you lose everything under your soul that's not him every trauma from the past every wicked evil disgusting vile movie you've ever watched with your eyes it's in your soul that's why he says to guard it for out of it will flow the way you live your life as a man think it's in his heart which is your soul not talking about your human beating heart the heart also means the core or the center of something that's your soul that's what you are you are a living soul and what you fill it with is what you will become that's why people you've known all your life kind nice people i know some of them who now hate with a hate i've never seen before in people they hate and despise don't even know why why they listen to the fake news and for years they have filled their layers you have layers whatever you feel the most of is what you're going to begin to act like so if you don't like you change what you're watching even what you say goes in your own soul so if you don't like you you've been telling yourself that for years and you put another layer of it in you and what's in there is what you will think about and if you think about it you're going to choose it if you choose it you're going to do it again that's called what criminals do this is true that's why a criminal will get out of prison go commit a crime and go back right back to prison if they've been there 20 years it'll you know why it's in their soul and i've been to prison to talk it's good to hear that and i had 80 prisoners and they had somebody guards trying to watch they never watched they listened to protect me my husband was with me sitting up here staring at every one of them but then even he was crying and i told them how they were sought out by the enemy even as a little child they had a great call on their life so he didn't want them to be loosed on the earth they might find out who they are and do destruction to his plans so he gets them into crime this is truth he gets them into crime when you do it it was in your soul then he makes sure they get caught and then they get put in prison where they can't be a threat to him so every time they get up because it's in them guess what they do it doesn't matter how much therapy they give them how many classes they take them to if they can't get it out of them they'll think about it they'll do it and then they're back in the same place so i told them the story of their life this is what you're doing this is why you're doing it this is what god had for you this is what satan is doing to you and will proceed to do it to every member of your family if you can then they begin to cry then they get furious you get mad at the devil then they get born again filled with the holy spirit then it teaches them how to war i teach them how to send heaven's army so now insider prisons are very dangerous people who are dangerous against hell i mean anybody could go to prison right but why are these people in rhythm they are dangerous because of their destiny and satan doesn't want them loose your soul is very important to you don't ever forget that you choose with your soul all day long you choose christ right after that you should choose what he chooses all day long you should guide what you choose what you watch what you say i love that little saying these half years what would jesus do what would he say what would he choose it's actually a very free life to not sin people get shocked when they say i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's not you choose not to you just say no say no to who was ever asking you sorry my soul is too important i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really think you were weird who cares because when they start to die they'll call you to pray for them they'll look for you if it's on their deathbed hey you know about heaven i need to go there don't forget they made fun of you that's why it's important that you not suffer trauma for 30 years after it happened you know who's doing that the devil because you saw it or experienced it and he will replay it and replay it stop the video stop it stop it stop it and lose it from your soul jesus and after your will because of jesus to lose it from your soul he'll come down and pull it out and it will literally be like it never happened to you i've seen too many people set free and they went from being you know in the drudges of despair suicidal they'd have these dreams every night about the torment or whatever it was the trauma they went through and three minutes with me and the revelation god gave me while their husband their pastor went in the store to get me some things to eat i was invited to speak his wife was set free she was a different person when he came out and then she brought her 17 year old and her 11 eleven-year-old sons to me because they were present when she was abused so much they lose out all their soul and they haven't never six years later have never had another nightmare or torment you can be free the truth makes you free and the truth is you can be free even from heroin from witchcraft homosexuality it doesn't matter what it is from the enemy you choose with your will to be free and yes we pray for people to be free from homosexuality which is a spirit and guess what they have powerful destinies every one of them the devil targets the ones who have the greatest destinies to bring freedom or liberty to people and he wants to keep them from doing that so he gets them distracted sidetracked on the wrong path filled with lies believing that's how god made them but remember when he made them he wrote on their soul this is who you are this is what you will be and he had plans for them from that moment i will tell you this there is a move coming to them and millions of them will get born again [Applause] [Music] not not not just a few millions he'll move on them they'll know who they will they'll know the entire time it was a lie and they will repent from it reject it completely and run into god's kingdom and they'll be great witnesses i will also tell you this millions of muslims are about to expect they will experience salvation god is still into saving people number one thing make sure you belong to him if you get saved at least you're going to have it a lot of people have it happen on their deathbed and the family member said i never saw it happen so you think it didn't happen did you believe they would be because the number one thing besides getting jesus you better believing that your family members will know jesus christ give their life to him and be with you in heaven there's a reason why you should do that you have the greatest influence in the spirit realm over their life as family members and jesus the first time he took me to heaven said there'd be so many in the earth to be shocked when they get there to see who's up there and yet they were the very one who prayed and believed for their salvation we have so many promises as a believer we as the body of will see an example a living walking breathing taking authority dominion releasing life to people and let them see you happy and joyful while you're doing it maybe they might want jesus one of the biggest things i know it will happen eventually the world will know us the body of christ by our what our love for each other stop fighting the plan of the enemy divide and conquer is his plan and in this whole last year several years before the virus it's not a plague and it is not a disease even in the natural viruses come and they go but people act like they are i'm not saying you can't protect yourself if you want to i'm not tolerating sickness or disease i'm not tolerating it every time you bless your food i hope you're blessing your food i won't ask for a show of hands my daddy let us eat after we blessed our food and then he added things the prayer went on forever i know where he got it from because when his mom came off the mission field she would have a 40-minute prayer at the dinner and she knew that open her eyes if you're going to leave the table and then she'd pray for you blessing your food is a very powerful thing because it says when you do that and you ask he will take sickness far from you [Music] so if you haven't been doing it do it that means he won't allow it to come to you or your home that's what you've got an interpretation he won't allow it to come to you or your home if you were declaring that when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes long but you know i added a few things i will hold my plate up in the restaurant or anywhere else look at father doesn't this smell good i'm going to enjoy every bite of it so bless it to my body and may the isis have a never-ending crisis may hell have triple trouble in hell as long as i'm alive i thank you for blessing all those who serve you who know you who love you amen so if we go out together after i'm invited and that pastor says will you bless the food who's ever with me will go okay and what are they gonna do here i'm picking up my plate are they gonna sit there and just stare at theirs lift it up everybody [Applause] i'm training you to bless your food that you actually can have food and actually can eat the food amen many countries can't do that but we can remember that the next time somebody asks you to say blessing i challenge you to do it do you know why because it was a day when i was in my late teens and i was saying my wrote prayer father thank you for this blessing he's in my body and what's wrong with his name my person thank you amen did you even hear those words and i literally heard from heaven this is before he started taking me i heard like a rubber stamp wham 500 billion 260 million 810 0001 can you say something else that we might actually be excited to hear he really said that to me so from that day i have never blessed my food like that it's a habit that's not a blessing that's not a blessing it's a habit right you need to get god excited father i thank you for this amazing food it smells good looks good i can't wait to see what you're going to do with me next i am so ready who cares what people hear at least they'll know there's someone around that knows god my little sister gave her famous blessing i think she was four or five and we were all not one of our other sisters i have eight sisters and seven brothers in an alligator named charlie but he's in heaven he doesn't have to live in a bathtub up but i've seen him in heaven your pets i'll go to heaven be nice to them they'll remember you and they'll talk [Applause] [Music] and i already hear some people's heads it's too late to tell me that's not true you haven't been there because if you did you would know that why not did you know that many animals actually have a spirit and a soul go back to genesis and read when noah back in the day when my meetings would be six hours long i'd do three or four i was just like like this and i would call let's see i called them i have called noah moses and adam and then one time i called him noses because my head was so tired i couldn't remember and every time i did that everybody emailed me i don't think you know who actually put people on the ark and then we get phone calls and they go yeah she knows she blew what okay she knows this is moa and moses and noah because you know she couldn't really remember if you go back and read that you know what i'm telling this is what the father told me this is how he taught me like a little kid because when i go to heaven i'm like eight years old with pigtails and he actually talks to all of you like children man is the one who likes to expound and make things totally not even understandable or approachable but god doesn't talk to us like that so he talked me said i'm going to teach you something and why because i'd seen pets in heaven and i'm like wow there's every one of my pets they were in this long line and they were on my father's ranch in heaven and they started with sally the pig and i got i got corrected because i said there was pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the pig he was a family pet gave him to my father when he was tight for the ministry it was this big when it died it was 1100 pounds i saw her in heaven and her were two little mice that we had in new york city when you were allowed to have pets they lived in the wall they were residents so we just kept them i recognized my brother joey's duck name max that he had when he was nine charlie the alligator that i've always talked about we all had in florida we live in florida and he lived in our bathtub and we had to take it out and clean the tub and he'd wander around the bathroom every goat bird fish snake lots of them spiders and iguana named iggy i saw every single one of them in heaven every one of them a long line as long as you see following my dad walking around on my dad's ranch and the father took me to the store and he said i need to explain this to you because people will argue and they're not god so they think they know better than me but if you go read the scripture in genesis where i told noah to put the animals on the ark and then he took me further you know even closer further away at the beginning of time when he made adam and it talks about how you know god the father and jesus were both there by the way the father said adam jesus stepped out of him that's what the word always did he stepped out and made his body but there was no life in him until he did one thing the father leans over because the father carries life he leaned over and breathed adam's spirit of life that was his spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual body into his nostrils and he became a living soul and i went oh yeah i've always known that he said but you didn't never connect it to noah go back and read this scripture in genesis and i did and do you know what it says that god told noah to put every animal on the ark that had a spirit of life in it you don't have to believe me believe the word that meant those creatures had souls and a spirit body oh that's from god i can't take credit that's how revelation happens it changes the way you think so people will argue with you it's too late it's in the word so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul i think they just they go die and go to hell with the flies they came from hell they can't have a soul right but i did learn that all your pets go to heaven and then when one would die i'd actually see my angel take his spiritual body and take it to heaven your own guardian angel takes your pet's spiritual body and takes it to heaven and they live in your mansion they will be eating at the table when you get there they will not be eating off the floor anymore so people go it doesn't say the word animals are in heaven it says creatures preach the gospel to who what to what i preached the gospel to every pe i had i was gonna make sure they made it creatures remember around the throne the living they have bodies like animals but they're not they're highly intelligent have always been with god like melchizedek who had no father no mother no beginning or ends there was more than father son and holy spirit i always say father word and holy spirit and so melchizedek has always been with him he is father's personal high priest thank you not one of adam's sons he's not a human that died and went to heaven he's always been with him i've seen a syllabus this big that tells you about um what is it what is that one thing they talk about well number one they always talk about the stone god will give you when you get to heaven and you always see on the syllabus a river rock with some big long name because he will give you a nickname the only he and you know and that white rock is a white diamond is not a river rock the word rock in heaven means gemstone because he's not cheap or poor right when when you get married you give your the toes a ring with a diamond in it or some beautiful stone right he's old bran so get ready for your pets to be in heaven amen and they'll be with you for all eternity so i keep telling people be nice to them they'll thank you for how often you let them out or fed them the food under the table you weren't supposed to why do you think they tried to eat it off of the table later when you're not there you spoiled them so when he said heaven is beyond anything you ever thought or imagined it is unless i like the word unless it be revealed by his spirit so the spirit of god is the one who catches me up all the time without warning me i fall in the driveway i'll go to heaven i'm in the grocery store reaching for something he takes me to heaven my family know because they'll come in to talk to me and there's nothing in me this my spirit man's in heaven holy spirit climbs and keeps my body alive my husband is so used to it of 43 years he'll come in and say something to me i don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't look down and watch what people are doing are you kidding i'm listening to what god is showing me but my husband will say these words oh i'll come back later he is he is scottish he's not moved by anything even as his wife's body is sitting there not breathing he is not concerned see he picked the right person for me i remember the first day he saw an angel walking down our hallway and he freaked out although i've talked about them thousands of times he actually saw one he's like nothing would come out i said oh did you see the angel he never doubted he just never you don't sit there and cry because he doesn't get to go he's happy i go and he's happy i speak don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll get a joke and it will be a scottish silk that you'll never get the ending to you'll never get the punchline but if you ever want to fish and catch big fish that is a gift god gave him when he sent him from himself he made him a fisherman that's his passion that's his greatest thing besides me and jesus and guess what i hate i hate fish let willy be free i don't want him in my freezer in my home in a frying pan or on my table they're slimy they stink they smell and i don't like i don't like them so if i went fishing he'd have to take it off he'd still be here the jesus game and i'm not touching that fish and do you think god knew this of course he knew it of course he gave somebody somebody with five layers in their soul that's like a rock and you aren't ever changing that man i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can say loves jesus he hears very clearly gives me words from god all the time a little scratches of paper but doesn't talk about it so he gave me somebody who doesn't care about talking or want to talk thank god right because we'd be wearing each other out i pray for people spouses want to see they both minister and they're wanting the microphone [Applause] i have no competition yeah well my sister kind of makes up for her the baby who said she'd never talk to anybody but but taught 15. uh-huh how many kids you haven't used to class 16 two-year-olds for about 15 years now she's braver than me i don't want to do that i don't want to catch fish and i don't want that either but she's really good at so that's why she's writing all the children's books and they're amazing our artist is every time he gets time he works on it every child around the world will know there is a heaven there is a god and what life is like there and the last place i was taken that was new was called whimsical way it's up in the celestial realm the sky of heaven and any little child who wants to in heaven either climbs into a bubble gets on the bubble train and takes him up to this amazing place parents don't have to go and they have all these creatures little creatures that are their friends and one day we'll they'll be part of our amusement park we've made so heaven has got lots of plans for kids fun you're probably one of the first congregations i told this to it was amazing these little creatures had names they were wearing clothes they were friends to these other kids and they would all go up there whenever they want to and play and play and play and have fun create little things and then they come back down because you live with your parents or your grandparents or whoever is the closest in relation to you when you get to heaven no child is left alone we should celebrate who we are that is your destiny and the new earth i get a lot of flack from that get over it you're not god he's going to make a and say new say new means new he's already remodeled this one several times already he has yeah and when you get to heaven everybody gets to see when he made it you all learn how he made the earth the first time how it got messed up in verse two think about it verse one verse two how did that happen so quick in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that means it was done say don imperfect then wine number two is it a mess why is the water on the land and the sky why is it trapped underneath all that stuff why is the earth all split up why is it in darkness the first one he didn't need the sun or the moon yet he made him yet no he lit it with his glory we should study the book of jeremiah he turned the light out at one time satan was making the earth a wilderness rick not me knows but really when he made it the first time it was perfect and he lit it with his glory there was no evil on the earth at that time and then of course you all know satan lucifer was cast out of heaven down to the earth and he thought he was going to take over he's tried so many times i don't know why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs became evil because they got possessed and used and i know people talk about i don't know where they get these things from reptilian seed because god made the donors dinosaurs not satan oh you don't even want to know about the reptile you don't need to know about okay it doesn't have anything to do with us man comes up with their own head knowledge and understanding of something and there are no nephilim on the earth right now i assure you there aren't any so there's too much really to talk about all that you've already got what you really needed when the first 15-20 minutes you have revelation that a lot of people don't know what's going to happen you heard like uh i know 24-year plan but really actually heard about a 50-year plan i've been taking over 100 years into the future and the earth was still here and it was good it was really good each generation until god is ready to stop things it'll get stronger they will manifest more they'll be in charge more and children will probably be the first ones who command a mountain to jump into the sea and if they want to put it back they will because we go from where this is not glory to glory glory to glory glory to glory this is us now glory to the pit glory to the pit glory to depression glory to lack glory to lack that isn't the way it goes it goes from glory to glory to glory that is an upward motion in authority in dominion in joy and celebration and the earth being well a hundred years from now it will be like that so forget stop trying to make plans to escape i don't want to escape i want to be here i'll be here the whole time and the people well jesus comes tribulation comes it's all over no it's not you don't know the bible because jesus gets he will get his thousand-year reign and god's not keeping that from him why would he he's going to sit on that throne in jerusalem and be king of the world for a thousand years and it's still not over because satan will be in a big pit oh yeah there will be no weapons on the earth during that thousand years people will live to be seven and eight hundred years old because christ is sitting on the throne and there'll still be people who aren't saved so that means people will make it through the tribulation the whole earth will not be destroyed in the tribulation and everybody won't be killed off the earth as there'd be no natural people for jesus to rule over when he sits on that zone in jerusalem at the end of the tribulation right yeah who's he going to rule who's he going to be in charge of and there'll be kings and countries that don't want him there can you believe that they must have the let's be unintelligent i'll be polite it's not what my flesh wanted to say they will be as unintelligent as the devil they will not want him and they'll know he's the son of god i mean he just wiped up all the all the wicked evil armies right he won like trump won not that he's god but look at him he won and he thought this is going to be easy breezy and never has every devil around come after somebody so harshly they hate him because he stands for justice liberty and freedom but they really hated him when he became really dangerous and said i'm fighting god back in january that was it that was it the devil went crazy he's not going to stay in that seat i'll impeach him i declare i'm incompetent other people rise up all over you know what they want a civil war here for a long time they want all of us to run the streets and kill each other and i've told them i've talked to them sometimes do you not understand a true american they actually want life they want a future they have a family they don't want your garbage go to a third world country and live if you want socialism go where they have dominism we're not going to have it here why the people don't want it [Music] you don't want it and they'll make it sound like it's amazing make it sound like it's beautiful go to venezuela they're living in dumpsters if they can find one that's what happens i grew up because of my natural age i've been through many generations of time on the earth i remember the turmoil of the 60s when people wanted to have nothing but love and or war then they didn't want to go to war they didn't want to do nothing i remember that but i also remember doing we would do these what do you call them when you have to do little see my earth mine doesn't work so well not projects it's when you would hide under your desk in case the russians are coming to get you anybody here have to do that you were practicing if you were going to be bombed by the russians what's called the cold war it's pretty cold on that floor under my desk and when i was like eight nine ten they all did it they'd they'd stop and they would let the alarm go everybody would just buy habit oh drop what you're doing crawl under your desk and hide in case the bomb would hit we lived like that until it was ended okay so you don't want to live in russia i've been there the sadness is so horrific i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go unsure i could feel it and see it like black clouds of evil and that i could feel with the people with a great deep sadness and grief that they had no freedom because if they take your weapons the criminals aren't going to give up theirs you wonder where their heads are right and who in the world wants to do well i know this is political well you have to give it up because tomorrow that's what you're really going to get god is very politically minded he doesn't want that he only wants that who in the right mind shows you they probably don't have one anymore wants to defund the police i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in california or washington or oregon or new york chicago i could just go down this list who in their mind having had no freedom for five months would vote in that same governor or the senators or the people who didn't care if their places were being destroyed where does that come from i promise you i won't tell you some things the president's going to do as soon as he gets reelected he'll be tweaking some governors i'll just say that much and some mayors and getting laws changed [Music] because people even the ones who voted him and don't want them now because they who won't allow are having all the freedom they want to do what they want to and they're openly showing what's in their soul that's the point of all this god is exposing the souls of people and they can hide and smile behind their big office but when it comes push to shove what's in that soul is coming out and people couldn't believe it when it started happening what is wrong with those people are they insane because their people don't have liberty freedom and there is no justice there is no protection there's no food there's no jobs people's houses get broken into when they want to do you know how many people i want to tell you how many people have moved to florida we are being crushed with people every day because they were seeing us on the news having liberty freedom and justice enjoying our beaches we were as good as we could be to work along with the quarantine but we had fresh air everywhere we went you could open your door and have fresh air and people saw that and went i'm not staying here no more so they're moving out and that should obviously we think would show the head of that person who's in charge they don't like this they're leaving that means no votes now no one's going to want to vote them back in you want to go through that again and no tax money you're right no tax money to take care of anything it's a mess it's all free if they say give it up give it all there give it all to us we'll just take care of you don't even think that's what's going to happen you gave away your destiny your future your home your rights your rights your rights your rights ask what satan wants but he's not going to get away with it here say where to go so people have a lot of questions they'd like to ask me and we'd be here for 10 more hours and i wouldn't be sleeping people always invite me then if they ever ask me to visit their home they try so hard to stay up while i'm up and they're like falling asleep sitting next to me wanting to ask i don't do that anymore by the way i've actually spoken in i'm trying to remember the name of that great black university it's either maryland or washington dc i actually got to go speak there oh yeah george washington university yeah i did i was invited and they couldn't squeeze the people they couldn't get them they gave us a small room then bigger room a bigger room because the students asked for it and they have to say yes and they had so many crammed in there you couldn't hardly breathe and the next night there was even more and i was staying in the home of this family nobody could stay up they're like i gotta go to sleep and i'm still sitting here you know in heaven you don't have to sleep people go i always wanted a bedroom done a certain way well you'll get it he'll make it for you to make you happy it'll be your lounge room your meditation room you don't need to meditate when you're living with the one that you meditate about your mansions are amazing some are under the crystal sea somewhere up in the skies of heaven they have a rain forest in heaven these 12 massive trees that could hold some i've seen mansions the size of new york city one one mansion probably belonged to an intercessor seriously somebody you never knew or heard of you know they prayed in every move of god until they were going on they're probably still praying when they were leaving and i like to tell these young people you may be living your life you want to but if you have a grandma in heaven she's going to pray the fire of god down on you to send the angels of heaven to pursue you and talk to the holy spirit non-stop you may as well get up here roll over and lay down and give up right now because they're going to get you you'll listen to the prayers of your grandma i was in a where it was a fireman's sub i'll talk anywhere and somebody made a comment about my hair which god picked not me i did not pick this thing here i was not a pink hair person oh no remember i was the one that wanted to just hide i want to be invisible i was okay with being invisible he said you're not going to be invisible you're not going to be hiding anymore that's what he said to me we need you to have pink highlights in your hair now i had probably about 40 pastor friends in my city and then they thought that was it i went over the edge knowing me not changed but my pink hair made it impossible to to be friends with what is wrong with these people oh they have no clue they're they're in the flesh not the spirit this is a spirit test if you don't like it you're in the flesh you like it you're walking in the spirit so i don't ask for it but you can't hide so everywhere i go and pastors go i can't invite you my congregation would freak out if they saw your pink hair i said you just didn't know how many hours they watched of me on youtube and guess what they come to my meetings at the church next door to you i don't think they're not the ones who aren't ready i think it's you so because of this pink hair it opens up me to speak about heaven everywhere everywhere everywhere all day all day no matter where it is it's even happened here already it doesn't matter people are attracted to it while your hair is amazing yeah the pastor should hear that right get your evangelistic team to get color-colored highlights in their hair and send them out into the streets and see how many people they can draw it's great marketing and so they will say hey your hair is cool yeah this is heaven culture what does that mean that means i know god he asked me to have pink hands in his hair i've been to heaven they all have highlights what and they never say this you're lying this is what a non-believer no matter how on drugs whatever it is they'll go what did it look like you know their souls kind of loosened up because they've been taking something and what's in there will come out what did it look like i've had meetings at the cashier where the lines backing up then they're listening the bad boys are listening the bad boys at the next one cashier comes over so they can hear well i'm saying it's because of this thing here so i understand jesus when he said we need you to have pink highlights in your hair and he can read my thoughts and i'm thinking in my head why and he looked at me and says it's if the lord of glory ever says to you with all the love he has his heart it's necessary i don't care what he wants then he just keeps he keeps going we don't want you to be hidden you can't hide anymore we're going to market heaven with that pink hair we want people to know the truth we want to know it's not boring it's exciting it's powerful it's amazing i want you to know as a believer the authority and dominion that you have in this earth and it's okay if you color highlights in your hair you look like heaven angels are different colors they're not just all pasty white glowing with white wings in a white gown some would probably make you crawl under your seat they have a band around their head with eyes and that whole band they have they have this this whatever thing they call this thing a breastplate thank you yes they have eyes all through them in the front and the back their wings are made out of electricity or lightning their faces are angular their eyes are diamond shaped if one comes in your room it's not from hell and some of them can look really fierce really fears like i have two heads one facing this way one facing that way they both look front and back no matter where they're turning they can see some are weapons they don't need to carry weapons i'm more acquainted with the army of heaven than gabriel's group i've seen gabriel's group i know my guardian angel i've known him since i was little he's 40 feet high i won't tell you his name ask god would you tell me what my angel's name is so i could say thank you you're not worshiping him and they won't let you worship them and an army doesn't get worshipped they want commands they need orders like this army they have generals they have privates they have commanders all kind of levels in the army itself but we get to command because jesus christ did they were made for us to command they don't protect heaven not one angel there's not one angel building is not one was designed to protect heaven from who from who the army didn't even get to throw them all out michael held him while god zapped him with a lightning bolt from himself it says i saw a satan fall as lightning well one third of the angels went right behind him he kicked them all out that was his um intolerance no tolerance for evil or wickedness he doesn't want us to tolerate it either your words your deeds what you choose what you say especially declare yourself into the spirit realm how you go get a staff it helps well i declare the state will not have my neighborhood i come in the host of heaven to get into every single home leave the life of god in there speak to every person while they're sleeping drive out every demon from this place because i'm not living near them and i will not tolerate them and i won't then i went from that to my city then i went to that to my state driving all the witches out please don't dress like a witch on october 31st you're inviting them harvest festival one thing don't participate with satan's holiday my daddy always told me it was wrong i said to my grandmother and one day we realize it is wrong why would he have a holiday he deserves nothing remember that when you get invited to something one day we in one quest will have the biggest festivals of light all over the world on october 31st we will celebrate life the life of god his plans and we'll throw a party everywhere we go and tell people what hell is really like and so is halloween you don't want it you're participating don't look at me weird i've been to hell you don't want to participate it's all real his plans his revelation his son holy spirit christ wiping up hell on the third day they were screaming and running he was melting the faces of the hierarchy of hell enjoying it why did it say he made a show of it he was putting on a show in hell god put a show on in heaven right when he kicked him out christ put a show on in helm when he wiped him all out guess who gets to put the show on on the earth we do we do because of jesus for jesus and with jesus we will put the biggest show on ever that is why he calls us his sons and daughters that's why he says we will manifest his absolute power and authority in the earth it is our right as a born-again believer having invited jesus into our lives when i was four and i asked him in i saw him step in me i was four years old don't discount your little kids i liked it so much when i was five i did it again so i'm book one i said i got born again at four on book five book two hey don't tell me there's five and book two i said i got saved to five and this woman who loved everything i had been saying

twice maybe you should maybe you should do it again in the assemblies of god we got saved every week we did whether we needed to or not we still got saved oh the baptist did it all the time they're doing everybody's neighborhood in their yard it doesn't matter the baptists are great soul winners y'all they really are they're very bold but don't let the watchtower people come in your home don't want to give you their watchtower magazine burn it or shred it it's false religion all false religions are run by one person that satan is called an antichrist spirit remember jesus talked about it

do you believe [Music] [Music] superhero [Music] and he will win [Applause] this is a part of time appointed by me from heaven this night i light a flame on the top of this mountain it will never be put out for you have stood through adversity through the lies to the accusations through the control the demands of man you have worshipped me you have not forgotten my son you have not forgotten what he's done you will be blessed and you will never stop being blessed for i am the god of everybody and the god of everything i'm about to shake this earth great exposure of the darkness [Music] [Applause] no matter what people or the fake news or the lying liberals have said about me or this time they don't know anything [Music] if they do not stop they will lose everything their words will become dust and blown away like they were never there for i say this is a time of greatness of acceleration you've never known and the manifested sons and daughters to come forth to demonstrate to manifest my power my love my plans [Music] the devil has plans he will fail and he will lose again and again and again and again and again and again [Music] for i have already said i will be in the white house for 24 years [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is no one on this earth in this earth under this earth that can stop it from happening for i will have these days on the earth the great days the great days of knowing there is a god that he speaks that he sears sees and hears if my prophets do not prophesy what i say they will not have a voice until that season is over for these are not the days of doom and gloom these are not the days of the rapture the perilous times the tribulation they're times of greatness of the fire and the glory sweeping over this earth touching everyone crushing the darkness and pushing it back for i am cleaning the stage wiping it clean are the enemies camp are the enemies people are the enemies dust [Music] for i will have my way my son made a way i will not ignore what he has done and i will not have a weak pathetic testimony of his sacrifice no one says when he is coming back but me and i am not ready for i will set you on fire and you will demonstrate like no one has before in all of history the powerful things of god to speak to the land the sea in the air and it will move do not tolerate evil and do not participate with it you choose life or death because they are apparently out there right now always choose life for when you side with those who want death of the unburn you will never win you will never succeed or complete your destiny you will repent because i bring life and life abundantly but you must choose it and if you choose it you must live it get out of the gray area stop riding on the fence for i hear those who've humbled themselves whose heart cries out for more but this time you get to bring them more [Music] i said it would be my sons and daughters who did it there is no age for them whether it's three or 153 you choose for if you sit on the side and do nothing that's what you will have a boring life an unfruitful life be bold and step out let people know what you believe and who you believe they'll come beating your door down to find out about your god not the false gods who have no life not the lies of the enemy he thinks he can take my country for it is mine i created it i called it into being i had people fight for it and die for it in the seasons past you've died to live for me but it now you will live and not die if you choose was it what is it to you if i keep you until my son returns be strong be excited and celebrate the victory even before it happens do not listen to the doom and gloom that does not come from me but fearful hearts that don't know what time it is they don't know what my plans are and they want to escape run your race but run it with me for i'll be right beside you and i will open the eyes of many and they will see me and they will know their god those who have stood and been faithful even under attack even though things were taken from you do you not think i can give you a hundred times more than what you had it is my desire to bless you it is my desire to be with you for there are times there are only in the power of my hand and these are some of those times listen to what is true where there is no confusion and nothing hidden don't believe the lies of those who live in sin and say they live and speak for me someone will remove from the earth [Music] i won't allow their testimony of who i am to be here many who are lying cheating and stealing and even killing will lose not just their seat but their life this is a holy time but it is a time to celebrate heaven celebrates with this time live on earth like they live in heaven but you have to be willing and obedient the host will not listen to those to be commanded by those who do not speak the words of my son nor have him in their heart not just as their savior but as their king many kings will come forth in this time for my son is the king of spiritual kings and the lord of spiritual lords in the spirit there is no difference between male nor female both can rise to that position of authority and dominion but you have to pursue it and if you want my thoughts you better walk in my ways and you better say his will his way not his will man's way i'm about to consume this country and people will come here to find me not just the american dream some regions the light and the glory will be so great in people will drive their dead relatives in there they'll come to life [Music] neither sin nor crime nor sickness will be able to abide in those regions you are forerunners it is an honor and a privilege to be chosen if you're alive and you're breathing and you've given yourself to my son you are chosen know this night that your god has visited you and spoken his words to you if they don't light up with others then do not receive those words for i stand on my word and beside my son on my throne these are days we have talked about before you were ever born before the earth was made we spoke of these days why would i give them up if you buy a bible and it says it's my word and it's left parts out don't read it if it makes it easy to live to freely sin there's the gods beside me that can bring you to my home those are lies from hell for my word and my truth will make you free says your god amen and amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] can you hear me now [Music] i know there are people who will tell you that you cannot see the faces of god and live but even the one who spoke those words and they were written in the word saw the face of god john himself in the book of john said you cannot see the face of god and live but in the book of revelation in chapter 4 he was caught up he was in the spirit that's a place you walk in he was in a place on that day where he could hear no word of man on the isle of patmos at least that day unless he decided to walk off of it i chose to let him see things are different because he was in that place i could catch him up and stand before my throne with the living rainbow moving in and out of me with life moving in and out of me and he saw my face and never again after that did he say you cannot see the face of god and live for i have caught many up and showed many my face my plans but this one's standing before you she is my revelator i will never stop taking her to heaven what business is it to you if i want to i hold the air you breathe if i choose somebody who's been willing and obedient and laid down in their life every time i asked why would i not trust her yes she's a woman and she's a king in the spirit [Applause] she's not just my servant she is my daughter and it is my great pleasure to reveal her as my treasure to operate without measure in these days [Music] if you're willing to pay the price you think it's so easy to have to live a halfway normal life on this earth when you're so connected to me in heaven she does not see things like you see them but she will reveal everything i show her and will not be afraid of the face of man even hell trembles when she speaks [Applause] everyone should be dangerous against hell it is evil and wickedness that tries to consume your country but i will not tolerate it for my people have humbled themselves they have repented of their wicked ways and i will heal their land [Music] for i hear everyone and i see everyone nothing is hidden from me when i look at the earth i rejoice i remember when my son and i made it we made it to kerry the glory the power the a wonder station before you come home i know your trials i know your test if you fall down get up [Applause] tell the enemy you will no longer tolerate him in your life that means you will not tolerate his images his words his frequencies his songs you create a habitation for heaven in your home and it will come you will see angels coming and going for you are in a new season the season of the high call of god of your god why did you not expect for things to be exposed before every great thing was done hell always acted up but this time the exposure is for your benefit these are not new things they've always been here you just never knew it i'm pulling away every closed door basement building things hidden in the wilderness things hidden in the forest even things hidden underground i will expose it all [Applause] the lives of those those who want to stand and run your country but hate me hate life even hate the people they want to govern it will not happen for i will shake them and nothing will be hidden but openly shown and dealt with even those have already been in power and think they've gotten away with it [Applause] [Music] they will not trump may not be perfect but he gives me permission to be in this country from the highest office in the land he has welcomed me and prayed to me and made friends with my pastors my prophets my teachers my evangelists his closest friends are my sons and daughters but the world would reject them and hate them there are many people in this world praying for your president even they love him even they recognize the good in him the authority in him he will help to shift many leaders of many governments so i can shape that nation and he will sweep his platform clean one day to make room for pence i have heard words spoken against my vice president and i am not happy he is a godly man who is not afraid of anything he is a strong tower to temper your president he will win two terms also [Music] [Applause] for i have written that in my book and what my book says it will happen not maybe happen [Music] [Applause] whoever he picks to be his vice president will then be president for eight years after him by that time there'll be no opposition that will even have a voice to speak [Music] [Applause] america will be a great light to this world it is my gift to this world who allows my son my greatest gift to operate in this world get ready because the show is beginning [Music] there's coming a day when people will step into a store thinking they're going to buy something and they will step into my glory and begin to cry out to know me satan knows about these days but he was hoping he could stop them this is a place of freedom liberty and justice for all it is also a place for righteousness and holiness that your amazing forefathers heard my voice and made plans for it the enemy has always been afraid of america don't be afraid even if you come home you'll be with me there is no fear not even in death you just step from life to life if your family live here they're the most blessed people in existence plans to be great because it is time for i will pour out my spirit on all flesh children will begin to pastor at age [Applause] five children are the easiest to reach because they don't question and they don't reason and they don't let their mind get involved that's why i said you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom you have not because you asked not but those who've asked already will surely get what they have asked for it is a new time on the earth a miracle will be an example but many countries will run to the light and to my son for there is a habitation coming that will not end until i say it will [Applause] end rejoice that i have shown these things and spoken to you of these things for those are my plans the more you believe it is real the more real it will become there's coming a day very soon that when you come here the glory will be waiting [Music] portals are being opened everywhere for heaven to pour in but also for blessings to pour in those who say i cannot speak through the voice of a man or mankind don't know me make sure you laugh laughter is the language of heaven but profanity is the language of hell don't let those words be in your mouth in your home allowed to enter into your home guard your soul and the souls of your children by not letting anything pass through any form of media it will be a trap of the enemy of what you've given permission to come will come if you say good morning to me every morning you'll be saying it before my throne you command the day by what you choose when you first wake choose life and love my power my presence extreme discernment and get understanding these days will come quickly and your life will change day by day so all who hear this message if you are my son or my daughter if you have received my son and repented of your sins these words are for you do not walk around with your head held down but lift it up where your help comes from even if people laugh they will not be laughing for long pray for those who have chosen the darkness and are expecting it to win some will take their life when they lose because their souls have been compromised by the lies they've been listening to guard well the layers of your soul what you put there and always choose life i love you says your god amen yes [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh it is hard to stand i won't fall i'm sure my angels are behind me i don't want a stool what is that no no but we could just lay hands on everybody and end it [Music] it's pretty pretty hard to top god and for those of you who don't think this is real may he come to you when i walked in the angel of the lord who looks just like jesus came in behind me to make sure i wouldn't fall down before i got up here and god's been speaking to me like the last several hours before i got here and some people think why is she late why is she late well are you going to turn around and say no to god i was right on time [Applause] god was very wise calling me a revelator instead of a prophet because he knew all the bashers wouldn't know what a false revelator was he was very detailed with me before i started traveling and speaking and he'd already warned me about a lot of stuff that would happen or would be said which i understand people don't understand what they don't know or they have not experienced their self it is hard for them to receive it seeing is not believing receiving is believing god has given me many titles i didn't ask for any of them and many people say i want to be you i go no you don't you don't really and i've heard people say he chose seven men before he chose you no he didn't he did choose me he knew me when i was in him he knew every one of you already knew what you would become and on your soul that he created he wrote if he would be male or female no matter how man says how that happens and your soul will be conflicted if you're told you're something else because your soul already knew what it was supposed to be but if the ones who wanted to take over have their way they would let anybody choose whatever they want to but god has a plan you were with him before you came to this earth before this world was made before he stretched out the universe the physical realm over the spiritual realm that's why when it says in revelations he will roll it up he knows where the ends are he had to put something out there that he could put physical things on because all he had the original realm is the spiritual realm the unseen realm unless he lets you see it from the time i was little i was a seer i saw the good guys and the bad guys i saw activities of the spirit realm you hear people talk about angels and demons there's much more than that all around you there's buildings built that both sides use depending on what is going around in that area there's platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places how do they get in high places they earn it by hunting for souls for the enemy these are wicked spiritual beings however when you learn to command an army that was created to pull down every stronghold of satan they're the ones who war against hell no matter what level of wickedness they operate in they can shred those platforms built by these spirits of wickedness in high places and they go through light buzz saws and they can't stop it from happening because we who have the flesh you're the ones who have authority in the earth every spirit would be coming from hell trying to take over they use people like they apparently are right now but they cannot do it they can't the earth is made for men and those who receive jesus christ you're called to rule in the spirit realm when you take authority and dominion in the spirit realm it then impacts and packs this physical realm and because we haven't known how to do it to his fullness satan has just taken all he wants to done what he wanted to kill who he wants to put fear in who he wants to we're not tolerating it anymore jesus clearly said the things i did you will do and greater things you will do than i did so you should be trying to stop the storms we can help you do that you can either email or call our office and ask for weather warrior information that's god's name that he gave for this group who's willing to step out and just do what his son did i didn't pick that name we are to take authority over any form of destructive weather and whether you know it or not in the word of god when he made the ocean and he made the land he told the ocean i set a boundary right here at the land and you will not pass over that's god's word that's his decree we are his sons and daughters it is our job to uphold that and tell those storms you will not cross over on the land or do destruction he created the weather to nourish the earth not to damage it so we sit down here and say god come and rescue us come and stop this and he's looking down saying i gave you authority you have authority you rule because the enemy knows he can get in and twist any of those weather system and use them the best he can because he comes to what kill steal destroy and one of the ways he does that is with the weather so volcanoes are not supposed to be erupting tsunamis are not supposed to be destroying none of that stuff that's going on but there's been no voice or agreement in the body that they would no longer tolerate that he taught the disciples how to multiply food how to travel in the spirit realm how to take authority and dominion over all the power of the darkness cast out any and all demons to pray for the sick to be healed why are we tolerating the virus because i'm not it has no right here the body needs to wake up stand up and step out you can wake up all you want to he wants you to do all of those things and i can tell you right now the meteorologists don't know what's happening they're going wild we even have some of their briefings where they talked about what is wrong with this weather they're almost afraid to give a forecast of anything because it never happens and then they faked it they faked it to prove these things were happening those weren't even the storm that was going on those in the area that the storms are headed to have the greatest authority if you're a believer so those on the east coast we have melt we have built a wall and if you go back and look at every storm that's come after dorian when we told it we all started saying you will not and cannot cross over the boundaries god set for you and all the way down not just in florida where we started it all the way up the east coast believers are standing saying you will not cross over and do destruction and every time a storm comes you can go look at it it comes a certain way then it hits the wall and goes back out and they don't understand it's simply the body of christ taking authority so when we learn oh hawaii has got it down we have a lot of friends there's a lot of weather warriors that live in hawaii it doesn't even get started before they get out there and they start i'll never forget the time that this massive like i think was category 5 was coming and i had been teaching and talking to him about taking authority and we all declared that this storm will not be allowed to come ashore and the head of it would be taken off and when everyone went to bed except me because they don't sleep at night when they all went to bed when they woke up there was nothing but shreds left and they couldn't understand or get it because they knew for sure that the the island would be consumed and those people those whether foreign would not let up that prayer of agreement we had they said we don't know how it happened but it looks like the head was taken these are the meteorologists saying this the head was taken right off [Music] it was a nothing and one reporter said never in 25 years of being a meteorologist i ever see i never saw that happen i'm still trying to go back over all the tapes all the information that we've accumulated to know exactly what could should have happened and it didn't happen why because they're not tolerating it so whoever lives in the gulf better stop stepping up is not coming to florida i live there and i'm not putting up with it anymore [Applause] you need to just get fed up what yes whoever has the fires in your state you better start saying you're not tolerating it anymore you come into low pressure system to form and come in and put the fires out [Applause] that is not something new in the bible they called forth rain to come and they begin to see the clouds form did it come and did it rain why are we any different than them it's called believing your faith and guess what in heaven you'll need your faith not to pay your rent not to be healed not for any of those things but to begin to create who is our father do you know in the bible when it says let us make men in our image that's what they look like like with the glory on them the light of god on them but after our likeness is how they operate we're supposed to operate like them we are not god you don't want to be god i don't want to be god i've seen alone but i still don't want to be god no one's that many kids the devil actually isn't god's problem it's how we all operate and stand against them he should be running does it say he will run from us do you remember that scripture you submit yourself under the hand of god and resist the enemy what will he do he will flee from you he's talking to you you do you know the word resist doesn't go oh no no i don't know what this is i will not tolerate you you're a liar and a friar and i serve the most high god only him and he'll run there are people the demons beg not to be assigned to because when they come back and they're not successful with their assignment they get punished the devil doesn't give anybody rewards not even his own he just punishes them when they don't listen so they don't want to they'll lie they'll do anything they can they don't want to and by the way when you learn to release the anointing they burn and it hurts they'll burn if they get near the fire of god it will burn them like it's going to melt them they may live in hell's fire they don't want god's fire why baptism and fire is coming [Music] [Applause] see i was raised on the word of god god chose when my birth would happen on this earth he chose my father's my mother's by the way my mother is here tonight she'll be 90 next april she had 15 children i am number three and my sister's number 15 right there and any of them could testify to anything i'm saying i never was normal i didn't want to speak to people even though i didn't want to speak to people i didn't want to hug them i just wanted god jesus holy spirit you know my little nice apartment somewhere and do big business he took me out of my world of business yeah it's like he didn't know we need to pay checks seriously he did this he always told me before he would do something with me my grandmother was my dad's mother was a powerful woman of god she was in the jungles of panama and was afraid of nothing ever she'd come to her home on sabbatical i mean we had more kids than anybody she could have come any anywhere i don't remember she had eight or nine of her own our aunts and uncles so she had a lot of children but she always came to our house because god was there we knew she could see through the walls we knew she could see right inside of us and every time she came she'd lay her hand on her head you will serve and know the most high god and my brother would run and hide i'm not going to be a missionary and be eaten by the alligators or crocodiles no right now they lock him on death row to minister to death apprentice prisoners he's invited by hell's angels to come and do funerals i don't think he's afraid of crocodiles anymore my mom would tell me every day you are so strange i don't know what god's going to do with you i was little i ate once a day i slept four hours a day my whole life i would know things my siblings didn't care too much for that my dad was a great mentor that his own mother in the jungles of panama on her own they had a murderer loose in the village i know some of you heard the story before but it just shows you who she was she was on the mission field in the little hut somewhere where she was ministering and she i think she lived there for i forgot how many years many years and everybody was boarding up their windows to keep this murder from out she left her window open and she went to sleep right in front of the window because guess what she knew god sure enough late at night here comes a foot in the window and this huge machete coming with him and she turn around look at him and she goes freeze in jesus name and rolled over and went back to sleep and three hours later when the police arrived he was still frozen that was my grandmother i was taught to never be afraid i knew there was a god i knew there was his son i knew there was holy spirit who is my best friend that means he'll tweak you 24 hours a day that's what that means let me speak to you 24 hours a day but lots of times he's tweaking you he wouldn't warn me something's going to happen i don't think i'd do that that's what he says to me i don't think i'd go there so i'm not going to go there okay i don't ask him why but you have to have your ears open to listen and it's really good idea if you say i choose holy spirit to give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention it is one of the most powerful things you can say anybody here let's just say it together holy spirit from this moment on i give you permission to get my attention when i'm not paying attention so be it there you did it i did that when i was really young it saved me a lot let me tell you if i gave the mic to jen she'd come up here now she would preach all the time she knows that's true because he does the same thing with her every morning it's called living a new life heaven culture isn't just a thing it's a lifestyle so if you want to live on earth as they live in heaven you need to learn to live heaven culture what is that how they live in heaven and living the same way on the earth they're free of fear free of lack free of grief free of anything of the enemy never sick they go well they're in heaven yes they are but our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come by the way that is heaven your kingdom is heaven you're speaking to the father right your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven that is heaven culture you are literally praying a prayer that asks for heaven culture and he's released it on the earth you choose it you lose everything under your soul that's not him every trauma from the past every wicked evil disgusting vile movie you've ever watched with your eyes it's in your soul it's why he says to guard it for out of it will flow the way you live your life as a man think it's in his heart which is your soul not talking about your human beating heart the heart also means the core or the center of something that's your soul that's what you are you are a living soul and what you fill it with is what you will become that's why people you've known all your life kind nice people i know some of them who now hate with a hate i've never seen before in people they hate and despise don't even know why why they listen to the fake news and for years they have filled their layers you have layers whatever you feel the most of is what you're going to begin to act like so if you don't like you change what you're watching even what you say goes in your own soul so if you don't like you you've been telling yourself that for years and you put another layer of it in you and what's in there is what you will think about and if you think about it you're going to choose it if you choose it you're going to do it again that's called what criminals do this is true that's why a criminal will get out of prison go commit a crime and go back right back to prison if they've been there 20 years it'll you know why it's in their soul and i've been to prison to talk it's good to hear that and i had 80 prisoners and they had somebody guards trying to watch they never watched they listened to protect me my husband was with me sitting up here staring at every one of them but then even he was crying and i told them how they were sought out by the enemy even as a little child they had a great call on their life so he didn't want them to be loosed on the earth they might find out who they are and do destruction to his plans so he gets them into crime this is truth he gets him into crime when you do it it was in your soul then he makes sure they get caught and then they get put in prison where they can't be a threat to him so every time they get up because it's in them guess what they do it doesn't matter how much therapy they give them how many classes they take them to if they can't get it out of them they'll think about it they'll do it and then they're back in the same place so i told them the story of their life this is what you're doing this is why you're doing it this is what god had for you this is what satan is doing to you and will proceed to do it to every member of your family if you can then they begin to cry then they get furious you get mad at the devil then they get born again filled with the holy spirit then it teaches them how to war i teach them how to send heaven's army so now insider prisons are very dangerous people who are dangerous against hell i mean anybody could go to prison right but why are these people in rhythm they are dangerous because of their destiny and satan doesn't want them loose your soul is very important to you don't ever forget that you choose with your soul all day long you choose christ right after that you should choose what he chooses all day long you should guide what you choose what you watch what you say i love that little saying these half years what would jesus do what would he say what would he choose it's actually a very free life to not sin people get shocked when they say i don't sin oh that's impossible no it's not you choose not to you just say no say no to who was ever asking you sorry my soul is too important i'm not corrupting my soul they'd really think you were weird who cares because when they start to die they'll call you to pray for them they'll look for you if it's on their deathbed hey you know about heaven i need to go there they'll forget they made fun of you that's why it's important that you not suffer trauma for 30 years after it happened you know who's doing that the devil because you saw it or experienced it and he will replay it and replay it stop the video stop it stop it stop it and lose it from your soul jesus and after your will because of jesus to lose it from your soul he'll come down and pull it out and it will literally be like it never happened to you [Music] i've seen too many people set free and they went from being you know in the dredges of despair suicidal they'd have these dreams every night about the torment or whatever it was the trauma they went through and three minutes with me and the revelation god gave me while their husband their pastor went in the store to get me some things to eat i was invited to speak his wife was set free she was a different person when he came out and then she brought her 17 year old and her 11 year old sons to me because they were present when she was abused so much they lose out of all their soul and they haven't never six years later i've never had another nightmare or torment you can be free the truth makes you free and the truth is you can be free even from heroin from witchcraft homosexuality doesn't matter what it is from the enemy you choose with your will to be free and yes we pray for people to be free from homosexuality which is a spirit and guess what they have powerful destinies every one of them the devil targets the ones who have the greatest destinies to bring freedom or liberty to people and he wants to keep them from doing that so he gets them distracted sidetracked on the wrong path filled with lies believing that's how god made them but remember when he made them he wrote on their soul this is who you are this is what you will be and he had plans for them from that moment i will tell you this there is a move coming to them and millions of them will get born again [Music] not not not just a few millions he'll move on them they'll know who they were he'll know the entire time it was a lie and they will repent from it reject it completely and run into god's kingdom and they'll be great witnesses i will also tell you this millions of muslims are about to expect they will experience salvation god is still into saving people number one thing make sure you belong to him if you get saved at least you're going to have it a lot of people have it happen on their deathbed and the family member said i never saw it happen so you think it didn't happen did you believe they would be because the number one thing besides getting jesus you better believing that your family members will know jesus christ give their life to him and be with you in heaven there's a reason why you should do that you have the greatest influence in the spirit realm over their life as family members and jesus the first time he took me to heaven said there'd be so many in the earth to be shocked when they get there to see who's up there and yet they were the very one who prayed and believed for their salvation we have so many promises as a believer we as the body of crisis will see an example a living walking breathing taking authority dominion releasing life to people and let them see you happy and joyful while you're doing it maybe they might want jesus one of the biggest things i know it will happen eventually the world will know us the body of christ by our what our love for each other stop fighting the plan of the enemy dividing conqueror is his plan and in this whole last year several years before the virus it's not a plague and it is not a disease even in the natural viruses come and they go but people act like they are i'm not saying you can't protect yourself if you want to i'm not tolerating sickness or disease i'm not tolerating it every time you bless your food i hope you're blessing your food i won't ask for a show of hands my daddy let us eat after we blessed our food and then he added things the prayer went on forever i know where he got it from because when his mom came off the mission field she would have a 40 minute prayer at the dinner and she knew without open her eyes if you were going to leave the table and then she'd pray for you blessing your food is a very powerful thing because it says when you do that and you ask he will take sickness far from you so if you haven't been doing it do it that means he won't allow it to come to you or your home that's what you've got an interpretation you won't allow it to come to you or your home if you are declaring that when i say my blessing is not 30 minutes long but you know i added a few things i will hold my plate up in the restaurant or anywhere else look at father doesn't it smell good and i'm gonna enjoy every bite of it so bless it to my body and may the isis have a never-ending crisis may hell have triple trouble in hell as long as i'm alive i thank you for blessing all those who serve you who know you who love you amen so if we go out together after i'm invited and that pastor says will you bless the food who's ever with me will go okay and what are they gonna do here i'm picking up my plate are they going to sit there and just stare at theirs lift it up everybody [Applause] i'm training you to blush your food that you actually can have food and actually can eat the food amen many countries can't do that but we can remember that the next time somebody asks you to say blessing i challenge you to do it do you know why because it was a day when i was in my late teens and i was saying my rope prayer father thank you for the soon blessings in my body and my swelling was named my person thank you wayman did you even hear those words and i literally heard from heaven this is before he started taking me i heard like a rubber stamp wham 500 billion 260 million eight hundred and ten and 0001 can you say something else that we might actually be excited to hear he really said that to me so from that day i have never blessed my food like that it's a habit that's not a blessing that's not a blessing it's a habit right you need to get god excited father i thank you for this amazing food smells good looks good i can't wait to see what you're going to do with me next i am so ready who cares what people hear at least they'll know there's someone around that knows god my little sister gave her famous blessing i think she was four or five and we were all huh not jen one of our other sisters i have eight sisters and seven brothers and an alligator named charlie but he's in heaven he doesn't have to live in a bathtub up but i've seen him in heaven your pets i'll go to heaven be nice to them they'll remember you and they'll talk [Applause] [Music] and i already hear some people's heads it's too late to tell me that's not true you haven't been there because if you did you would know that why not did you know that many animals actually have a spirit in the soul go back to genesis and read when noah back in the day when my meetings would be six hours long i'd do three or four i was just like like this and i would call let's see i called them i have called noah moses and adam and then one time i called him noses because my head was so tired i couldn't remember and every time i knew that everybody emailed me i don't think you know who actually put people on the ark and then we get phone calls and they go yeah she knows she blew it okay she knows this is moa and noses and noah because you know she couldn't really remember if you go back and read that you know what i'm telling this is what the father told me this is how he taught me like a little kid because when i go to heaven i'm like eight years old with pigtails and he actually talks to all of you like children man is the one who likes to expound and make things totally not even understandable or approachable but god doesn't talk to us like that so he talked me said i'm going to teach you something and why because i've seen pets in heaven and i'm like wow there's every one of my pets they were in this long line and they were on my father's ranch in heaven and they started with sally the pig and i got i got corrected because i said there was pork in heaven i didn't say he ate the pig he was a family pet gave them to my father when he retired from the ministry it was this big when it died it was 1100 pounds i saw her in heaven and her were two little mice that we had in new york city when you were allowed to have pets they lived in the wall they were residents so we just kept them i recognized my brother joey's duck name max that he had when he was nine charlie the alligator that i've always talked about we all had in florida we live in florida and he lived in our bathtub and we had to take it out and clean the tub and he'd wander around the bathroom every goat bird fish snake lots of them spiders and iguana named iggy i saw every single one of them in heaven every one of them a long line as long as you see following my dad walking around on my dad's ranch and the father took me to the stone he said i need to explain this to you because people will argue and they're not god so they think they know better than me but if you go read the scripture in genesis where i told noah to put the animals on the ark and then he took me further you know even closer further away at the beginning of time when he made adam and it talks about how you know god the father and jesus were both there by the way the father said adam jesus stepped out of him that's what the word always did he stepped out and made his body but there was no life in him until he did one thing the father leans over because the father carries life he leaned over and breathed adam's spirit of life that was his spirit man he breathed adam's spiritual body into his nostrils and he became a living soul and i went oh yeah i've always known that he said but you didn't never connect it to noah go back and read this scripture in genesis and i did and do you know what it says that god told noah to put every animal on the earth that had a spirit of life in it you don't have to believe me believe the word that meant those creatures had souls and a spirit body oh that's from god i can't take credit that's how revelation happens it changes the way you think so people will argue with you it's too late it's in the word so i don't think mosquitoes have a soul i think they just they go die and go to hell with the flies [Applause] they came from hell they can't have a soul right but i did learn that all your pets go to heaven and then when one would die i'd actually see my angel take his spiritual body and take it to heaven your own guardian angel takes your pet's spiritual body and takes it to heaven and they live in your mansion they will be eating at the table when you get there they will not be eating off the floor anymore so people go it doesn't say the word animals are in heaven it says creatures preach the gospel to who what to what i preached the gospel to every pe i had i was gonna make sure they made it creatures remember around the throne the living they have bodies like animals but they're not they're highly intelligent have always been with god like melchizedek who had no father no mother no beginning or ends there was more than father son and holy spirit i always say father word and holy spirit and so melchizedek has always been with him he is father's personal high priest thank you not one of adam's sons he's not a human that died and went to heaven he's always been with him i've seen a syllabus this big that tells you about um what is it what is that one thing they talk about well number one they always talk about the stone god will give you when you get to heaven and you always see on the syllabus a river rock with some big long name because he will give you a nickname the only he and you know and that white rock is a white diamond is not a river rock the word rock in heaven means gemstone because he's not cheap or poor right when when you get married you give your the toes a ring with a diamond in it or some beautiful stone right he's old bran so get ready for your pets to be in heaven amen and they'll be with you for all eternity so i keep telling people be nice to them they'll thank you for how often you let them out or fed them the food under the table you weren't supposed to why do you think they try to eat it off of the table later when you're not there you spoil them so when he said heaven is beyond anything you ever thought or imagined it is unless i like the word unless it be revealed by his spirit so the spirit of god is the one who catches me up all the time without warning me i fall in the driveway i'll go to heaven i'm in the grocery store reaching for something he takes me to heaven my family know because they'll come in to talk to me and there's nothing in me this my spirit man's in heaven the holy spirit climbs and keeps my body alive my husband is so used to it of 43 years he'll come in and say something to me i don't hear him i'm in heaven i don't look down and watch what people are doing are you kidding i'm listening to what god is showing me but my husband will say these words oh i'll come back later he is he is scottish he's not moved by anything even as his wife's body is sitting there not breathing he is not concerned see he picked the right person for me i remember the first day he saw an angel walking down our hallway and he freaked out although i've talked about them thousands of times he actually saw one he's like nothing would come out i said oh did you see the angel he never doubted he just never you don't sit there and cry because he doesn't get to go he's happy i go and he's happy i speak don't ask him if he wants the mic you'll get a joke and it will be a scottish silk that you'll never get the ending to you'll never get the punchline but if you ever want to fish and catch big fish that is a gift god gave him when he sent him from himself he made him a fisherman that's his passion that's his greatest thing besides me and jesus and guess what i hate yes i hate fish let willy be free i don't want him in my freezer in my home in a frying pan or on my table they're slimy they stink they smell and i don't like i don't like them so if i went fishing he'd have to take it off he'd still be here in jesus game and i'm not touching that fish and do you think god knew this of course he knew it of course he gave some of me somebody with five layers in their soul that's like a rock and you aren't ever changing that man i'm glad he knows jesus that's all i can say loves jesus hears very clearly gives me words from god all the time little scratches of paper but doesn't talk about it so he gave me somebody who doesn't care about talking or want to talk thank god right because we'd be wearing each other out i pray for people spouses want to see they both minister and they're wanting the microphone [Applause] i have no competition yeah well my sister kind of makes up for her the baby who said she'd never talk to anybody but but taught 15. how many kids you haven't used to class 16 two-year-olds for about 15 years now she's braver than me i don't want to do that i don't want to catch fish and i don't want that either but she's really good at so that's why she's writing all the children's books and they're amazing our artist is every time he gets time he works on it every child around the world will know there is a heaven there is a god and what life is like there and the last place i was taken that was new was called whimsical way it's up in the celestial realm the sky of heaven and any little child who wants to in heaven either climbs into a bubble gets on the bubble train and takes him up to this amazing place parents don't have to go and they have all these creatures little creatures that are their friends and one day they'll be part of our amusement park we've made so heaven has got lots of plans for kids fun you're probably one of the first congregations i told this to it was amazing these little creatures had names they were wearing clothes they were friends to these other kids and they would all go up there whenever they want to and play and play and play and have fun create little things and then they come back down because you live with your parents or your grandparents or whoever is the closest in relation to you when you get to heaven no child is left alone we should celebrate who we are that is your destiny and the new earth i get a lot of flack from that get over it you're not god he's going to make a and say new say new means new he's already remodeled this one several times already he has yeah and when you get to heaven everybody gets to see when he made it you all learn how he made the earth the first time how it got messed up in verse two think about it verse one verse two how did that happen so quick in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that means it was done say don imperfect then wine number two is it a mess why is the water on the land and the sky why is it trapped underneath all that stuff why is the earth all split up why is it in darkness the first one he didn't need the son or the moon yet he made him yet no he lit it with his glory we should study the book of jeremiah he turned the light out at one time satan was making the earth a wilderness rick knocking nose but really when he made it the first time it was perfect and he lit it with his glory there was no evil on the earth at that time and then of course you all know satan lucifer was cast out of heaven down to the earth and he thought he was going to take over he's tried so many times i don't know why he didn't give up but the dinosaurs became evil because they got possessed and used and i know people talk about i don't know where they get these things from reptilian seed because god made the donors dinosaurs not satan oh you don't even want to know about their children you don't need to know about okay it doesn't have anything to do with us man comes up with their own head knowledge and understanding of something and there are no nephilim on the earth right now i assure you there aren't any so there's too much really to talk about all that you've already got what you really needed when the first 15-20 minutes you have revelation that a lot of people don't know what's going to happen you heard like uh i know 24-year plan but really actually heard about a 50-year plan i've been taking over 100 years into the future and the earth was still here and it was good it was really good so each generation until god's ready to stop things it'll get stronger they will manifest more they'll be in charge more and children will probably be the first ones who command a mountain to jump into the sea and if they want to put it back they will because we go from where this is not glory to glory glory to glory glory to glory this is us now glory to the pit glory to the pit glory to depression glory to lack glory to lack that isn't the way it goes it goes from glory to glory to glory that is an upward motion in authority in dominion in joy and celebration and the earth being well a hundred years from now it will be like that so forget stop trying to make plans to escape i don't want to escape i want to be here i'll be here the whole time and the people well jesus comes tribulation comes all over no it's not you don't know the bible because jesus gets he will get his thousand-year reign and god's not keeping that from him why would he he's going to sit on that throne in jerusalem and be king of the world [Music] for a thousand years and it's still not over because satan will be in a big pit oh yeah there will be no weapons on the earth during that thousand years people will live to be seven and 800 years old because christ is sitting on the throne and there'll still be people who aren't saved so that means people will make it through the tribulation the whole earth will not be destroyed in the tribulation and everybody won't be killed off the earth as there'd be no natural people for jesus to rule over when he system that's owned in jerusalem at the end of the tribulation right yeah who's he going to rule who's he going to be in charge of and there'll be kings and countries that don't want him there can you believe that they must have the must be unintelligent i'll be polite it's not what my flesh wanted to say they will be as unintelligent as the devil they will not want him and they'll know he's the son of god he just wiped up all the all the wicked evil armies right he won like trump won not that he's god but look at him he won and he thought this is going to be easy breezy and never has every devil around come after somebody so harshly they hate him because he stands for justice liberty and freedom but they really hated him when he became really dangerous and said i'm fighting god back in your country that was it that was it the devil went crazy he's not going to stay in that seat i'll impeach him i'll declare him incompetent other people rise up all over you know what they want a civil war here for a long time they want all of us to run the streets and kill each other and i've told them i talked to them sometimes do you not understand a true american they actually want life they want a future they have a family they don't want your garbage go to a third-world country and live if you want socialism go where they have dominism we're not going to have it here why the people don't want it [Music] you don't want it and they'll make it sound like it's amazing they'll make it sound like it's beautiful go to venezuela they're living in dumpsters if they can find one that's what happens i grew up because of my natural age i've been through many generations of time on the earth i remember the turmoil of the 60s when people wanted to have nothing but love and or war then they didn't want to go to war they didn't want to do nothing i remember that but i also remember doing we would do these what do you call them when you have to do little see my earth mine doesn't work so well not projects this one you would hide under your desk in case the russians were coming to get you anybody here have to do that you were practicing if you were going to be bombed by the russians what's called the cold war it's pretty cold on that floor under my desk and when i was like eight nine ten they all did it they'd stop and they would let the alarm go everybody would just by habit oh drop what you're doing crawl under your desk and hide in case the bomb would hit we lift like that until it was ended okay so you don't want to live in russia i've been there the sadness is so horrific i didn't i didn't get off the ship to go unsure i could feel it and see it like black clouds of evil and that i could feel with the people with the great deep sadness and grief that they had no freedom because if they take your weapons the criminals aren't going to give up theirs you wonder where their heads are right and who in the world wants to do well i know this is political well you have to give it up because tomorrow that's what you're really going to get god is very politically minded he doesn't want that he only wants that who in the right mind which shows you they probably don't have one anymore wants to defund the police i'd be amazed if anyone who lived in california or washington or oregon or new york chicago i could just go down this list who in their mind having had no freedom for five months would vote in the same governor or the senators or the people who didn't care if their places were being destroyed where does that come from i promise you i won't tell you some of the things the president is going to do as soon as he gets he'll reelected tweaking some governors i'll just say that much and some mayors and getting laws changed [Music] because people even the ones who voted him and don't want them now because they who won't allow are having all the freedom they want to do what they want to and they're openly showing what's in their soul that's the point of all this god is exposing the souls the people and they can hide and smile behind their big office but when it comes push to shove what's in that soul is coming out and people couldn't believe it when it started happening what is wrong with those people are they insane because their people don't have liberty freedom and there is no justice there is no protection there's no food there's no jobs people's houses get broken into when they want to do you know how many people i want to tell you how many people have moved to florida we are being crushed with people every day because they were seeing us on the news having liberty freedom and justice enjoying our beaches we were as good as we could be to work along with the quarantine but we had fresh air everywhere we went you could open your door and have fresh air and people saw that and went i'm not staying here no more so they're moving out and that should obviously you would think would show the head of that person who's in charge they don't like this they're leaving that means no votes that's right now no one's going to want to vote them back in you want to go through that again and no tax money you're right no tax money to take care of anything it's a mess it's all free if they say give it up give it all there give it all to us we'll just take care of you don't even think that's what's gonna happen you gave away your destiny your future your home your rights your rights your rights your rights that's what satan wants but he's not going to get away with it here say whoa to god so people have a lot of questions they'd like to ask me and we'd be here for 10 more hours and i wouldn't be sleeping people always invite me then if they ever ask me to visit their home they try so hard to stay up while i'm up and like falling asleep sitting next to me wanting to ask i don't do that anymore by the way i've actually spoken in um i remember the name of that great black university it's either maryland or washington dc i actually got to go speak there yeah george washington university yeah i did i was invited and they couldn't squeeze the people they couldn't get them they gave us a small room then bigger room in a bigger room because the students asked for it and they have to say yes and they had so many crammed in there you couldn't hardly breathe and the next night there was even more and i was staying in the home of this family nobody could stay up they're like i gotta go to sleep and i'm still sitting here you know in heaven you don't have to sleep people go i always wanted a bedroom done a certain way well you'll get it he'll make it for you to make you happy it'll be your lounge room your meditation room you don't need to meditate when you're living with the one that you meditate about your mansions are amazing some are under the crystal sea some are up in the skies of heaven they have a rain forest in heaven these 12 massive trees that could hold some i've seen mansions the size of new york city one one mansion probably belonged to an intercessor seriously somebody you never knew or heard of you know they prayed in every move of god until they were going on they're probably still praying when they were leaving and i like to tell these young people you may be living your life you want to but if you have a grandma in heaven she's going to pray the fire of god down on you because send the angels of heaven to pursue you and talk to the holy spirit non-stop you may as well get up here roll over and lay down and give up right now because they're gonna get you you'll listen to the prayers of your grandma i was in a where it was a fireman's sub i'll talk anywhere and somebody made a comment about my hair which god picked not me i did not pick this thing here i was not a pink hair person oh no remember i was the one that wanted to just hide i want to be invisible i was okay with being invisible he said you're not going to be invisible you're not going to be hiding anymore that's what he said to me we need you to have pink highlights in your hair now i had probably about 40 pastor friends in my city and then they thought that was it i went over the edge knowing me not changed but my pink hair made it impossible to to be friends with well what is wrong with these people oh they have no clue they're they're in the flesh not the spirit this is a spirit test if you don't like it you're in the flesh you like it you're walking in the spirit so i don't ask for it but you can't hide so everywhere i go and pastors go i can't invite you my congregation would freak out if they saw your pink hair i said you just didn't know how many hours they watched of me on youtube and guess what they come to my meetings at the church next door to you i don't think they're not the ones who aren't ready i think it's you so because of this pink hair it opens up me to speak about heaven everywhere everywhere everywhere all day all day no matter where it is it's even happened here already it doesn't matter people are attracted to it while your hair is amazing yeah the pastor should hear that right get your evangelistic team to get color colored highlights in their hair and send them out into the streets and see how many people they can draw it's great marketing and so they will say hey your hair's cool yeah this is heaven culture what does that mean that means i know god he asked me to have pink comets in his hair i've been to heaven they all have highlights what and they never say this you're lying this is what i'm not a non-believer no matter how on drugs whatever it is they'll go what did it look like you know their souls kind of loosened up because they've been taking something and what's in there will come out what did it look like i've had meetings at the cashier where the lines backing up and they're listening the bad boys are listening the bad boys at the next one cashier comes over so they can hear well i'm saying it's because of this pink hair so i understand jesus when he said we need you to have pink highlights in your hair and he can read my thoughts and i'm thinking in my head why and he looked at me says it's if the lord of glory ever says to you with all the love he has his heart it's necessary i don't care what he wants then he just keeps he keeps going we don't want you to be hidden you can't hide anymore we're going to market heaven with that pink hair we want people to know the truth we want to know it's not boring it's exciting it's powerful it's amazing i want you to know as a believer the authority and dominion that you have in this earth and it's okay if you cut color highlights in your hair you look like heaven angels are different colors they're not just all pasty white glowing with white wings in a white gown some would probably make you crawl under your seat they have a band around their head with eyes and that whole band they have they have this this whatever thing they call this thing a breastplate thank you yes they have eyes all through them in the front and the back their wings are made out of electricity or lightning their faces are angular their eyes are diamond shaped if one comes in your room it's not from hell and some of them can look really fierce really fierce like i have two heads one facing this way one facing that way they both look front and back no matter where they're turning they can see some are weapons they don't need to carry weapons i'm more acquainted with the army of heaven than gabriel's group i've seen gabriel's group i know my guardian angel i've known him since i was little he's 40 feet high i won't tell you his name ask god would you tell me what my angel's name is so i could say thank you you're not worshiping him and they won't let you worship them and an army doesn't get worship they want commands they need orders like this army they have generals they have privates they have commanders all kinds of levels in the army itself but we get to command because jesus christ did they were made for us to command they don't protect heaven not one angel there's not one angel buildings not one was designed to protect heaven from who from who the army didn't even get to throw them all out michael held him while god zapped him with a lightning bolt from himself it says i saw a satan fall as lightning well one third of the angels went right behind him he kicked them all out that was his um intolerance no tolerance for evil or wickedness he doesn't want us to tolerate it either your words your deeds what you choose what you say especially declare yourself into the spirit realm how you go get a staff it helps ram i declare a state will not have my neighborhood i come in the host of heaven to get into every single home leave the life of god in there speak to every person while they're sleeping drive out every demon from this place because i'm not living near them and i will not tolerate them and i won't then i went from that to my city then i went to that to my state driving all the witches out please don't dress like a witch on october 31st you're inviting them harvest festivals are one thing don't participate with satan's holiday my daddy always told me it was wrong i said to my grandmother and one day we realized it is wrong why would he have a holiday he deserves nothing remember that when you get invited to something one day we in one quest will have the biggest festivals of light all over the world on october 31st we will celebrate life the life of god his plans and we'll throw a party everywhere we go and tell people what hell is really like and so is halloween you don't want it you're participating don't look at me weird i've been to hell you don't want to participate it's all real his plans his revelation his son holy spirit christ wiping up hell on the third day they were screaming and running he was melting the faces of the hierarchy of hell enjoying it why did it say he made a show of it he was putting on a show in hell god put a show on in heaven right when he kicked him out christ put a show on in helm when he wiped him all out guess who gets to put the show on on the earth we do we do because of jesus for jesus and with jesus we will put the biggest show on ever that is why he calls us his sons and daughters that's why he says we will manifest his absolute power and authority in the earth it is our right as a born-again believer having invited jesus into our lives when i was four and i asked him in i saw him step in me i was four years old don't discount your little kids i liked it so much when i was five i did it again so in book one i said i got born again at four on book five book two hey don't tell me there's five and book two i said i got saved to five and this woman who loved everything i had been saying and receiving it when she found out she said you lied this is a legalist minded person you lied you said you were born again at four and you said five you didn't even remember i said excuse me i did it twice maybe you should maybe you should do it again in the assemblies of god we got saved every week we did whether we needed to or not we still got saved oh the baptist did it all the time they're doing everybody's neighborhood in their yard it doesn't matter the baptists are great soul winners y'all they really are they're very bold [Music] but don't let the watchtower people come in your home they'll want to give you their watchtower magazine burn it or shred it it's false religion all false religions are run by one person that satan is called an antichrist spirit remember jesus talked about it that means anything is against christ's sovereignty and his his holiness of who he is his his anything is against that that speaks against that isn't antichrist spirit let's all stand up for a minute come back tomorrow i hope you come back tomorrow you hear about america a lot what'd you say wear red white and blue please i'll be wearing red white and blue i will and heaven will be wearing it too whoever watches whoever comes will i was recently in um not con carpenter's home church it was the name of the church in orlando calvary assembly of god i was there invited with a lot of other prophets who were taken out of their box because jeff jansen was in charge and he never has a program or a schedule you flow with him so all these great leaders are all sitting up on the platform and and jeff would just say get up there and start speaking and they're like they'd look at me because i'm a friend right he made me sit beside him or behind him in case i was the only one responding here's mike go go say something and they go what does he want to say oh you'll find out when you get up there then he calls us all said well what are we doing it doesn't matter let's just go up here and see what he wants to say it was powerful and we actually got to pray for the president because that was the the night i think it was released that he had was tested positive it was a it was it was a wild time because a lot of these people are like i've never done this before in my life you mean they don't actually have a schedule there's when is it going to end oh when he's done it ends when he's done he's flowing with the spirit of god it was a lot of fun it was powerful but most of them didn't know me and they looked strange but benny hinn turned around and shook my hand said i'm so glad you're here it was yeah his wife wants to be a new best friend suzanne she was excited about everything so you never know when god's gonna take you out of your box you may have been taken out of your box tonight but when you get to heaven it's going to happen anyway and even before that happens you can have encounters yes you need to be free [Music] amen be powerful don't ever ever be afraid don't ever be afraid so lift up your hands i want to bless you father i ask you to bless all of your sons and daughters who are here tonight or who are watching tonight may receive the blessing of the lord prosperity joy celebration revelation increase you better be yelling i receive it increase in every area of your life [Applause] restoration in your families [Applause] salvation for those who don't know him to run your race get all the weights out of the way and let you see what he can do with you because he loves you all he called you chose you appointed you and anointed you maybe may you step into that before you ever leave these meetings so man [Applause] hallelujah #housefires

let's honor cat as she comes this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] very good [Music] [Applause] before you sit down let's do something let's look up to heaven and welcome heaven how about that say father we are your children [Music] we love your son he lives in us this day we want to honor you and all those in heaven so we invite heaven to join us in this meeting so come quickly and enjoy the fun [Applause] y'all can sit down okay that's good well there's a lot of glory in here whoa yeah if you have never felt it it's real the more sensitive you are why do some people fall not fall it's not that something i want to do the more sensitive you become to him to jesus christ the more sensitive you become to the holy spirit and their presence because he's always with you and actually they're always talking to you when you learn how to tune that in tune the world out and tune it in you begin to hear them and it might be that still small voice but it's still them i always say them you hear me say them a lot i said it so many times someone said who are you talking about the trinity it's not one without the other right they've always been they've always existed they have no beginning no end i like the no end part i get crazy questions sometimes like will this all end and everyone just stop existing and went no way that's never gonna happen and you may never know everything about them because you'll always be learning and growing closer i'm talking about in eternity i mean you know you're actually already in eternity if you're a believer it's not like you're waiting on it okay it's just another season of your life but while you're here you have all got important commissions but if you're alive in this time you have extremely important commissions and one of those will be carrying the glory a lot of people i won't be talking about america obviously thank you everybody for wearing your red white and blue [Applause] the angels are in this room are wearing red white and blue just so you know that the ones that signed here especially because i asked would you please wear red white and blue god loves the red white and blue it represents his son i don't know if you ever knew that those stripes what do you think that represents it really does that's what it represents so the red and white and blue is his our president is his our country is his you ever wonder who to vote for always vote for life say life remember what god said i offer you you choose life or death but choose life right so this time it is about a man and god chose that man i talked somehow god talked mostly last night if you weren't here we actually heard from god himself speaking and he does that with me pretty often the more freedom in the atmosphere where i go the greater change you have of hearing from him because i didn't know he was going to do that but he has permission to use me any way he wants to i hear prophets say well i think the word of the lord is and what they need more maturity it's okay to open your mouth and let god speak and he does he does and he always will do that he loves to speak to his people but even people he'll speak to people who aren't his yet catch him up to heaven when they come back they want to know him they want to know jesus christ i know several times where things like that happen not in my meetings people haven't caught up a few times in my meetings mostly when they leave a lot of people see their guardian angel after they leave the meetings and that's okay don't worship them [Laughter] they won't let you that whole thing that has gone through the church for so many years uh it went from don't worship angels to don't talk to them have nothing to do with them and and yet in the bible itself not just the new testament in the old testament they actually had a little bit more freedom because there was no internet there was no fake news there was no liberals or legal list of people who said oh don't do that because they didn't know yet and and i can't i count on both hands how many and some weren't even like great men and women of god they were just people who god needed to do something and he would send angels why in the world do you think they have couriers now anyone who's been in a courier service understands how important that is heaven has courier angels they're under gabriel they're messengers couriers they have all types of angels worker angels uh ones that deliver things some that come and record things every person whoever got born again was recorded by angels is that important to god it was all recorded and not just what people saw with their natural eyes but what was happening in the spirit realm when you get born again the father son and holy spirit are all present when that happens because the father is fiercely loves everybody and if you could see with your own eyes i know when i was born again i was four i knew exactly what i was doing i saw jesus step inside of me i've always been a seer so i would not talk a lot about it to anybody when i was real little but i'd always see angels and sometimes the other guys you know so i'm not really afraid of them because i know that they're the losers and they have no power over me now i'm not letting them beat me up they're not going to kill steal and destroy anything of mine and that should be coming out of your mouth it's called ruling and taking dominion jesus said occupy until i come he didn't say stood on your rapture rug so the holy spirit had us make some pens that said roll up your rapture rug he actually came and said that tell everybody roll up your wraps your rug is not going to happen right now stick it in the closet maybe someone in the generations to come might want it you need to get your crown on it's more important to wear your crown than sit on your rapture rock because if you sit on the rapture road you'll probably never get to wear your crown or use it we all have crowns when you're a believer but what you do with that that that represents your authority and dominion when you get christ you get so many things but at that ceremony that's what heaven calls when somebody repents receives christ as a savior the father reaches inside of himself takes a stone of fire and puts it in that person's spirit man and that's what brings light it puts light in your spirit man that light can grow and grow and grow the more you pursue christ the more you obey the more you're willing the light grows and grows and grows and i can look at people and already know what have you been doing or yay [Laughter] some people are never told what you've been told what you're hearing but but from the moment we receive christ that is the first step the most necessary thing yes but after that you're supposed to run your race and go from glory to glory and you are more than a conqueror it's not like you're conquering you're taking the territory that christ already conquered for us to occupy means take authority and take dominion and take territory because we rule in the spirit realm but where you live the ground the air any water bodies wild around you anywhere you have rulership over all of that in the spirit realm you have a realm it comes with your christianity with your salvation and also at that time christ also takes something from himself the anointing he walked in this is all scriptural how about that this is the best part i know the word i was raised from the time i was a little baby my dad devoured the word and he actually lived it he loved his enemies like he did his friends so there was no skin color to us they were people that god loved and that we cared about very much we have adopted members of our family from almost every race my mom's sitting right there when people meet her i want you to be my mama so she had 15 but there's like 16 17 18 19 we ran out of numbers because they want to be a part of what we carry it's called love so christ reaches in himself and he takes a deposit of the anointing he walked in how do i know that because of first john 2 27 you see rick knows the walking bible back there if you want to know about a scripture ask rick he knows it and see rick i know this one the word actually tells you that it says when you receive jesus christ as your savior you receive a deposit of the anointing that lives and it abides in you guess what it doesn't go back to heaven it's given to you for a purpose it is a weapon and it's only yours it's yours everybody has one you're a believer but it's a deposit of the anointing he walked in so the father gives you something a stone of fire and you put more facets in it the more you do the more you grow the more you love the more you walk out the word and and carry the glory your facets the facets and that gemstone would blind the enemy that gemstone also has fire on it so here's the father giving you deposit of himself when you receive his son you get all of this you get all the holy spirit is right there all right he writes down okay i will begin to pursue them for me to indwell them but when you're born again he doesn't ignore you holy spirit is you can say holy spirit you don't have to say thee he's not an it he's a third member of the trinity he is also god right and they all have their they have their favorite things like we do their next favorite colors favorite foods jesus is just really got this serious thing about sweets he doesn't want deliverance from it though did you know he has his own mansion in heaven did he walk as a man on this earth doesn't he deserve one jesus doesn't live in this wrong room he visits much many many times he's there most of the time he's all around heaven saying hello to people you know just blinding you with his love and his glory but he actually has his own place and it sits in this field of these flowers that sing and worship him all the time now these flowers are like eight ten foot tall and you can't see the end of these flowers and his mansion is made very particular because he likes three things well he likes celebrations for sure but he likes sweets right he loves to dance he loves being with people so his mansion is different he's got one massive ballroom in it and all along the walls are these very beautiful probably made by him he still does carpentry in heaven all these wonderfully embellished tables and all of them have desserts on them he was raised on honeycomb and that never left him he loved going to weddings because guess what they always had lots of people sweets and they danced so because your mansion is made for you exactly the things you love the things you really love to do that you love to eat uh places and play i mean your mansion i've seen one the size of new york city so don't think you have a little cabin unless it's inside your mansion you know he'll do if you really want one he'll stick it in your mansion unless your mansion looks like you know a 50 000 square foot cabin most mansions don't have ceilings in them they don't need them it's easier for the angels to fly in and out or the creatures in heaven that come by to say hi if you have trees growing out of the floor that will talk to you and have conversations they come from the friendly forest does it say that the trees clap their hands it does and they really do so jesus has a one of the biggest places of celebration once you arrive and you have your welcome home party in the throne room and your family finally drags you out of there schambach stayed like forever some people just love being in that presence which is a massive celebration they don't have funerals in heaven they have celebrations and they have parties you don't need any alcohol you are drunk on the spirit all the time really people will step over you in the streets of gold because you're besotted with the presence and the all and the glory and the glory is one of the things i'll talk about this really i said god in the red white and blue it's really about the glory of what god's going to do with america i thought i'd share a little bit of heaven who's never heard anyone talk about heaven like that anybody if you've been there a lot you would be some people are afraid to i have a commission i have to share i i have a commission god came to me jesus christ came to me and said the father and i have decided to take you on tours of heaven that was over 20 years ago there's no way i can be normal when anyone dies i have a party inside the family doesn't call me unless they're ready to have a party because i've been at funerals and the and the ceiling is open and the person who died is looking at themselves in their casket your spiritual body goes to heaven your physical body is what rest right you're going to get it back you're going to get it back it's okay it's going to look really good and the day the dead in christ shall rise that is your body and your spirit man if you're already in heaven you're not going to miss that you can't you get it back first because you come in the clouds right with jesus you get your physical body first and anyone left on the earth that is born again they get their body glorified so it's okay to go home for half to heaven for some rnr because most people go i'm going to be here i want to be here when the rapture happens i'm like why are you going to know about it before anybody down here trust me they'll all know in heaven before it ever happens so i hope that helps some people they miss the rapture oh let me tell you they were raptured when they got here the moment you step from this physical body the presence of god and the love of god consumes your spiritual person you are seeing your guardian angels for the first time who never leave you they actually escort you to heaven and they've been with you your whole life yay i've always been nice to mine they had to put up with me growing up i wasn't bad i just wasn't a real happy person but anyway no i can see mine i see him all the time and when when god sends you into something new for him you get more okay you all have more than one because one has to stay here while the other one goes home for r and r remember what it says that your angel is always beholding the face of the father that's because one is here and one's up there at least many people have many and they come when you're conceived at the time of conception life begins because that is when your little spirit man is brought from heaven by holy spirit and he knits and attaches that little dot that little dot of flesh that's beginning to form in your mother's womb he takes your little spiritual man it's still you you've always been you just lived in god played like a little child somewhere about this big this big your different sizes you have these little shift things on you swim in the river of life you run up and down on the stones of fire you slide down the holy mountain you have a lot of fun you ride in and out on the rays of the rainbow that come out of him but you can't go any further you don't live in heaven somewhere you live in him in him we live we move we have our very being the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things what things when you lived inside the father why is he called the father why are we called his offspring i hope that makes sense to your head he carried us he carried us inside of himself and he said when i made the womb of a woman that's why i put water in it so it'd be familiar because you lived in him you played in the river of life he's very focused and the father is an extremely detailed person that's why he can put up with me my husband he gave me was probably the only person who ever could because he's got five layers to his soul he's happy if i love him and feed him and he can fish he doesn't have any more demands and so god picked him before he sent me he sent me first four years later my husband was sent into the womb of his mother but god picked us and he brought us together and 43 years later here we are he still loves me still loves food still loves fishing god is very detailed and focused when he made you and we are so amazingly made scientists still can't figure out how we can do different things how does our body operate the way it does it couldn't without a maker we didn't climb out of a slime pond the only big bang that happened was when satan was cast out of heaven [Applause] that's about it that's the big bang and it's not a theory it's the truth nope we have all been from the end of the beginning in the beginning beginning to the end when we lived in him because he went there is that what it says yeah and when jesus was called the word it was the father the word and holy spirit until the word came to die for us and was jesus christ his whole life changed i mean everything changed he had to change everything he was all spirit he didn't even look like he he looked different with flesh on um lucifer did not recognize him satan didn't recognize him lucifer that's who satan was before he fell was the most beautiful being in all of heaven god put gemstones all over him for a reason in his wings all just all over him when he would lead worship and the rays of glory would come from him they would hit the gems on lucifer and throw that rainbow like all over heaven he was anointed to carry that glory until he decided he wanted to steal it and you think about how long see heavens already had a war they understand the angels lost friends did you ever think about that they've been around together for a long long time and even though the army is very focused on what they do the army is the army they're called the hosts and if you met one they wouldn't want to be called an angel i know people who have met one more than one but the the army is the one i'm most connected with and god taught me to be a commander so you all could learn how to command god said command you me what he's saying is let me see you command when you learn in the word many times when it was either the fathers or the holy spirit whatever they said that was recorded in the bible sometimes if you turn the scripture around you see the whole revelation in it so if you take command ye me me i will see you command that's what he meant but so many scholars were freaked out that's revelation they were so freaked out why would god we cannot command him let's don't even discuss this don't you ever talk about this in your meetings because because and yet no ye not that ye are gods they don't want to talk about either that's with the little g that just means you can you you inside of you you have the ability to command the army of heaven only as a believer if you're not a believer none of these will you're here listening because you can't do any of it you must be born again to have this authority this dominion and all these things that god has given us if he says let's make man in our image and after the way we operate if jesus said i give you power over some of the power of the enemy say that loud then why don't we take it he says satan comes around like a roaring lion and coming to seek he can kill steal and destroy he didn't say he had the right to do it however it also says that he gives us mighty weapons he gives us weapons they that not an it you don't just give us a sword or a gun you know although it's okay to have those to defend yourself so i'm on the side of keep your guns and there's a reason why in this world you know while there's a devil who hates everybody and they have wicked evil people uh it's okay to defend yourself that's what makes us not a third world country it also makes us not communist and makes us not socialist that's called control that's called you have no life and you own nothing so those people talking about that stuff don't even know what they're saying let's send them to venezuela or russia let's send them to one of those countries let them have a week's vacation there they come back screaming we don't want to do that you have power and we have the right to rule and reign is says so besides the fact that he says you are kings and priests those are royal levels of authority and dominion those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion again if you're not born again you don't have any this is for the body of christ and all they're told is get saved and hang on to jesus comes and most denominations that's what they tell you go get people saved bring them in we'll pray they stay that way we are living examples in every sense of the word we don't have to tolerate anything from hell or anything from the enemy you know why because guess who didn't say jesus christ if we are joint heirs having been in law for eight years in my life i got a big lesson on what that meant and you all know why is it called the new testament that was his last will and testament that is a legal document sincerely of your rights and your inheritance and your abilities and your authority what he put in there's what we have and they stand up here just read them like they're really nice they sing their three songs and you go home totally unchanged unless you are personally pursuing a relationship with christ that's not who we are that's right we're not here just trying to get by we have given promises by jesus himself written in his word and is like if you took it to the court of heaven they would be saying well why aren't you doing this or saying this or why haven't you activated this why aren't you using their weapons what's wrong with the army of heaven are they not strong enough or have you not activated them in your life aren't you sending them against the enemy's strongholds trying to tear you apart and steal from you if you went up there without asking for stuff if you said explain this to me that's what you would hear well let's just unroll your bill of rights and clearly explain to you what we we should and then how to use them it is our job to train you you come to get trained if you're not trained you didn't get what you needed so people say you're going to start a church absolutely not thank you god in heaven i'm not a pastor one of the hardest jobs on the earth think how many kids you got right i already did that at home but you have to look at your life you have to look at your life a whole different way like what was christ saying what did that really mean is that something i have he said yes and the hard-headed man he was given because the father said i didn't give make it easy for my son then he takes me back in time and i get to walk behind the merry men and jesus on the way to go minister somewhere like i didn't have a vision and i never dream i don't sleep long enough i was there i saw people throwing rocks at the tax collector this is jesus's merry men following him he's trying to ignore most of them there is peter trying to yell at everybody about what they were doing wrong right this is exactly what they did patience that belongs to luke we're running down the road why did you give us up for him this is reality right he's been a physician for a long time he had a lot of patience let me tell you when you have a good doctor you don't want to lose them well he wasn't doing that anymore he gave it up but they didn't want to give him up this is exactly what i was showing and i went i'll never complain about my staff again and this is early on when he had his 12. the hardest ones to get roped in were james and john the sons of thunder that didn't mean thunder from god that means they were fighting all the time over pretty girls who thought they were awesome they had to get rid of the flesh when you think about what they became in a three short years it's absolutely amazing because no coach here on the earth could believe it could take that many people from different circumstances and ages and thoughts and everything you know and here was the son of glory saying i saw you when you were under the tree there earlier talking and said what he said that wasn't normal multiplied the foods there was so much left over from a couple fish which i don't like couple fish and loads of bread they could have had mine i would have given them mine baskets full left over now that was not normal was it when he disappeared into the spirit he stepped into the spirit room like this and he walked through the people when they were going to throw him over the cliff he actually said he passed through the people you know that right people go well he went around that's not what it says the orthodox jews knew he was a good man they thought he was a prophet they caught they gave him that benefit i know some they think he's a prophet and when he was having his meeting there after him they believe because i heard it face to face on a tour to israel uh which they hooked a mic on me and with steve schultz of elijah list they recorded every time i prophesied god said something somewhere and we were at the mount the precipice and so this orthodox jew was given his spin on it and he said yes the crowds wanted to kill him they didn't like it that he was good and he was doing good so they lowered a rope his disciples down the side of the mountain i saw the side of that mountain that rope would have been 250 300 feet long who's going to carry a rope around on a wagon right it's not like a little road and i'm thinking that's not even in the natural and so of possible all the believers are like just kind of staring at him but that's what they believe he let himself down no but then it was my turn to give revelation on where we were and i said well you all realize jesus as as the son of god although he walked as a man that is true he also was the son of god but even walking as a man he learned truth about the spirit realm the unseen realm it's a real place it supersedes the physical realm that's why angels and spiritual beings can pass through this wall they do it a lot sometimes you see them sometimes you don't but they have the ability but but jesus learned that he himself he was headed he had a spirit man inside he had a body but he already learned that he had access to that spirit realm so when this crowd came upon him this is all he had to do there are slits and openings everywhere if you step in you cannot be seen but you see everybody around you oh yeah like if i disappeared i would see everybody here i could hear you but you couldn't see or hear me so to you i would be invisible so what he did was when they were coming after him he just probably backstepped disappeared and he walked through the bodies of the people because the spirit supersedes the physical realm so he walked through the crowds right through their bodies until he got where he wanted to he stepped out of the spirit realm and there he was but guess what we are joint heirs and the things he did the works he did we will do also and greater things than that will we do there's now i won't tell this this is going from glory to glory there are requirements and some people don't like to hear that so people who are full of their self selfish spewing stuff these are christians i'm talking about because there's no way now i can tell you this the devil knows about the spirit realm and a lot of people in the new age movement have spirit guides those are demons and they'll take them in there but this is the thing this is why they're so insistent that that stuff is real they had a real encounter and because that doesn't mean what you're seeing is real that's why you must test every spirit and almost nobody says that or talks about that if an angel appeared in this room and said come and go with me i would say are you the spirit of the most high god who sent his son to die for the sins of this world and they can't lie so if he said yes i am the father has sent you i'd go with him if he said nothing or looked terrified i say get out i evict you get out i have nothing to do with you and that's what the basic probably one of the most important things that every believer will ever learn when you get born again because that's the moment the enemy really begins to pursue you he doesn't want you to be he didn't want you to know who you are see then then he's losing territory he's losing his impact he won't have a way to hold on to you or use you but this is one of the things jesus did he did it quite often he taught who fill up everybody say phillip say in the new testament philip travel through the spirit realm he would appear somewhere and then he would be gone he would be found in another place he traveled through the spirit realm just like christ did but people who sit in a church with the pastor doesn't have an understanding of the spirit realm the purposes god made it and what our rights are and how you do this is things you do you sent out assignments by god and and probably 20 40 50 60 years from now that might be a normal way of transportation let's say you're going to india to preach the gospel you may just step i don't know i don't know how he'll do it you could step in a certain room and then when you come out you're in india that was spirit realm you don't need a passport you don't need luggage and when you're done you probably turn around and step and you're back home this is our future [Music] now doesn't that make christianity a little bit more exciting there are people who are already connected with god with holy spirit and have an understanding of the spirit realm these people who just kind of astral project themselves out places that's something they're doing from their own soul it's dangerous you're out there with no one protecting you helping you and you're just bait the enemy can send these spirit guides if you do that and they'll take you to places and tell you all kinds of lies about where they're taking you and give you a commission because you had a real encounter you believe that was true and it wasn't so even some pastors who know are afraid to tell you should you misuse it should you misuse it or try it or something but it is our right to have an understanding of who we are so did jesus do those things and philip he's not the only one who travels but john did it all the time he left the isle of patmos when he felt like it you know why they put him there he wasn't even in a jail because that would be useless john they tried killing him so many times and they were terrified that he wouldn't die they couldn't even hurt him when they boiled him in oil he probably asked for a rubber ducky in the scrub bush john was sort of like peter at one time but now he spoke with confidence he knew who he was he knew he was under divine protection he was afraid of nobody so he would say boldly whatever god gave him when he went somewhere so that would be the best thing we can do is put them away from everybody on an island not realizing he was in the spirit on the lord's day which means he was in that spiritual realm when he heard the voice he looked up saw the door open and he was up in heaven the spirit realm is a place it is a place it's not just something you say but john who was the closest to jesus of all the disciples who never abandoned him not even at the cross that's why he gave his mother to john he had to die as his mother's savior not as her son that's why he said mother mom this is your son's son this is your mother he still recognizes that she birthed him in heaven she's highly honored not worshipped she's not she's not a deity [Laughter] she's very much loved because it took a lot had divine encounter with angels a good thing she was willing to listen to them right and then even joseph think about that that was tough when you do something great for god's surrender will always be required to some people that sounds like control and so they're afraid and if anybody's ever been in like a occult not occult occult that's satan's but a cult can be a christian cult you join it you live on land they get to tell you what to do and not to do it's still a form of control they think they're doing out of to help you but it's not some tell you who you can marry who you cannot marry i know people who were in one of those and they will not sign any kind of a document for anybody because they were under control when they got free they don't want they don't want to ever be controlled again by people so they're not a good thing either okay you don't need people to take you and keep you in a compound somewhere and run your whole life for you that's not god and they love and some of them love jesus and they may have their little church and worship and stuff but they have no rights really it's not a good thing it's certainly not god right so the i've known people who've been through that so they don't if you say well we have uh this we're having everybody to sign a covenant with us to be a part of what we're doing they won't sign it even though it has nothing to do with controlling them or anything they just won't do it they won't do it and i said well i'll just give you give you time pray for you you need to release all that from your soul and be free from that experience you had but especially if things hurt you or things happen to you and that it's not good you are responsible for yourself and the family god gave you and you're shaping i guess my sign to take a drink all this is coming to one thing it's about carrying the glory around america but i experienced last night yes god did step into me and i had waves i felt like this cloud came when i stepped out of the vehicle a cloud came and just i saw the cloud and i heard the father speaking so all the way in that's why i couldn't walk i didn't feel like i was here most of the time i didn't feel like even standing there if i moved and looked at somebody they would go they'd go like this and i have only encountered that one at the time when because this is saying what you're willing to talk about to people you're going to do it he needs voices to speak about the things he wants for us so they know this is something he has right if you're living if you're playing with sin it's not going to happen because you're a testimony right you're manifesting for him with these signs and wonders and greater works and he can't give those to people who are going to play in the darkness and go to church play in the darkness go to church and people know that and they see you doing this stuff they're it's gonna bring confusion so even though people have faked a lot of things they can fake being in the five-fold ministry they can fake all kinds of things one thing they cannot fake is carrying the glory or the fire and manifesting for god because he'll just take everything away so these are different days these are powerful days just doing the works is powerful like walking on water right multiplying food raising the dead who've been dead a long time you know or just maybe a few days who knows [Laughter] this is what i say if you're dead you're dead if he wants you you're not coming back if these are believers if he wants you or if he gives you a choice and you're in heaven be the hardest thing in their existence to be in the presence of the living god and his son in and holy spirit in heaven itself everything is alive there's more life there than anything ever so when they die their body does but they don't they step into real life they're very much alive declaring over you believing for you to be great for him instead of actually says in the bible if they could come back it'd be for one thing to be a part of what's going on now that's how important these days are and so i've been talking quite a bit about the days of glory it says that the knowledge of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea there's two things you need to realize there's two thirds of water on this earth that's significant when he says like the waters cover the sea that's much more water than land and what he's trying to say is you go many times over you will carry that glory you won't go somewhere and say glory come it'll be in you and it's released and it does huge things when you release it the knowledge isn't just oh it's the glory it's the understanding of what it is and what it does the knowing the understanding and the experiencing of it so you will do that and the glory grows in you like a cloud and at one point now this happened to me because i've been talking about it at this little place in missouri and went back to the products table and i started walking back and people started just falling and i'm like i could feel this power of god his power the glorious power it comes from him it's what's around him on the throne on the father his son carried it on this earth and so we we each get a measure remember things are given in measures but it can grow so i've been talking my son-in-law was with me handling the products table who's like an irish he's quite a character he's born again he's he's uh he is fearless and so he was a great addition to our family it took him to be able to marry my daughter who's just like me prayed prayed him in and prayed everybody else away i ran off every guy that was the wrong guy it didn't take much to make trips to heaven over time would you like to go one was a baptist boy bless his little heart my daughter is a seer she prophesies she knows all about these things i know she probably hadn't told you that uh and and i go to heaven all the time non-stop would you like to be able to do that this whole time he's backing up right it's getting big i said the kids you have will become prophets and seers they'll travel to the spirit realm they'll grab about one in heaven and just scare this little guy so much no i'm going to marry her she's going to have my 2.5 children i don't know what that and she will only do what i can tell i tell her she can do you have not known my daughter for very long that will never happen [Laughter] and i kept trying to show my daughter this this is not love it was like it was like they liked they liked the idea of being married don't get fooled okay you don't have to ask somebody if you are in love to somebody you cannot live without that's filled with god and you are so overwhelmed that the blessing god has given you if you have to come up and say do you think i'm in love [Laughter] no and so i told they were planning their wedding and everything and i want you're not going to be happy why don't you go visit his house and his dad was a fully in charge baptist he had to give permission to everybody around the table to speak oh yeah yeah her eyes start to get is this okay to tell stories on myself see i've experienced this self i know you don't want to meet the wrong person she comes back she goes i said how was it the food was good but i already knew because i'm a seer i can see where they are i can see what's going on when they're not with me how about that for a parent i know where you are right now if you don't get out of that movie i'll be there in 15 minutes we'll have revival in the theater and by the way there will be a repentance thing you can sign and take communion before you come back in the house that was growing up with me jen's raising her hand because jesus lived with me and my mom they loved me since 1999 so they know all this stuff they saw all this stuff happen she knows [Laughter] see i'm telling the truth that's what happens when you're here but it's the relationship i had and so i kept telling my daughter you're not in love you're not marrying that boy i'll lay down in the aisle well i'm telling i was telling all these things you know we'll have deliverance service serve all the baptists [Music] and i have very good baptist friends okay there'd be a lot of people in hell right now if i had meant for them but there's no way that with that was not a match made in heaven they'd be doing like this because my daughter is just like me in every way and out of the three the only one about heads with is guess who but they're raising their kids in the supernatural yeah so finally it's good so i told my daughter i'm going to fast dr pepper now that for me was like i'm pouring my life out right the biggest fast i could do because i only eat once a day there's not much to eat so i'm fasting dr pepper for three weeks at the end of that three weeks you will come to me and say i don't want him anymore but i have met this person at the end of three weeks guess what happened mom how do i break up with scott why did i think it was anything i have met ben she never said scott like that she never said scott ah scott's coming over [Laughter] yes bless his little heart he found him a nice little baptist girl and they're very happy just so you know that okay he didn't damage him and there was batten and i interrogated everybody who came up my husband laid back you know let's go fishing man [Laughter] it's the only break they'll ever get so when i met ben oh by the way in this whole process of realizing scott wasn't the right person she rebelled against him she got a mohawk [Laughter] her hair was like down here she got herself a mohawk and then the holy spirit had told her to put lightning bolts tattoo them on her sides get ready for kids for today y'all and she has uh gifted and danced highly i mean highly anointed and so when she was like 14 the holy spirit came to again and said i want you to put brass knuckles on your feet because they're weapons of god and they're like this long no she don't do anything little so she came and showed them to us after y'all and i went if god and god told me i did tell her to do that she's a sign and a wonder and she got to minister so many places and they she had red and purple hair i mean just just tell me she was so far out there in the heaven culture it was crazy she needed ben and the holy spirit calls him the irish boy with charmin blarney who pulls down you know he displaces principalities with the army of heaven and i went you were made for her [Laughter] it's worth standing in the gap for your children that they have the one god needs them to have your life is a journey but you don't ever ever have to be in a pit never and even if your children end up by running with the enemy they're up and out of home running for the enemy just let them know i love you i'm running after jesus but he will get you and they see you not messed up or upset or torn apart because jesus the joy of the lord is your you can be strong all the time you couldn't go after them anyway that would be havoc then you would be torn apart and then they would isolate you okay they got to live their life and make the choices you stand in that gap i believe and declare my child will know jesus christ become a witness for him and we'll be together in eternity and i'm running after jesus and eventually one day they'll come to you and say i need help if they want to come back home you better have a list of guidelines already prepared don't let hell in your home because you're trying to help your kids i'm serious that that would be the enemy's plan if you're willing to follow the guidelines i don't care if they're 40 or 30. it is your realm you create a habitation for heaven and god will make sure you know they don't die in the ditch somewhere but they have to learn they can't use you or take advantage of you because you love them this is truth i want you to have a glorious life and you have authority over all that junk but the glory of god is something he does talk about us having and we carry it and we release it and everywhere we go it will so impact it's like taking bazookas into an area where the enemy is trying to control and they just shoot it really shoots into those demons and it terrifies them it will begin to cover people like a cloud whole area sometimes whole cities will be covered with the glory you carry somewhere it's coming from you so when i got back to the room the other night i was still being consumed by this power of god that was he was here trust me he was here and he spoke last night and i was thanking him for letting me experience all that he says i need to let you know that glory was coming from you that wasn't mine that was coming from you that's what you already carry then i got undone we're entering into powerful days it's not about your age or where you came from what profession you have it is about your relationship with jesus christ and in heaven everyone in heaven is in love with him everybody they still love their family here but he is they're number one he is so it is is a profound thing and a high honor to carry parts of them the fire and the glory it all comes from them all of it say all that can't come from your physical being is something that has to do with your spirit man inside of you and that your soul has agreed to give god permission to do whatever he wants to with you and then when he says something do it right the more you do it the more he gives you that's like a job if you work well well in the past it used to mean that if you got a job you worked hard work well we're honest and hard you got promoted above everybody else some companies are still like that but it's always that way with god he doesn't love one person more than the other but some he can use more than the other don't let jealousy consume you don't covet somebody else's anointing you have your own remember first john 2 27 the more you release the anointing you know what the anointing looks like it looks like a blue fire it looks like blue fire we're going to stir up the anointing today and i'm going to release the glory on y'all but america's greatest call it has is to be a country known because it belongs to god and the glory of god will cover this land it will create regions of light those who refuse it will have regions of darkness until jesus comes all the darkness isn't going to just evaporate off the earth but there'll be seasons where it's pushed back and crushed back until it will have to have a region of darkness to operate in these are powerful times people who live in the regions of glory you'll get to choose there won't be an in between he's erasing the great area that says there is no god even in what he's doing right now to this whole election thing he's exposing the souls of men as a man think is in his soul or his heart so is he so why are these people hating wanting to kill wanting to control and you know they're doing that but i think they're dictators over states or cities not even realizing in their own head i have no way to be reelected that's right if i'm crushing the life out of the people i'm supposed to be leading and watching over why would they want that again they're moving to states where they don't have control because they're tired of it these aren't even people who are christians they're just good moral people i call them the moral majority who want life who actually do care about the life of the unborn they may not know jesus but they have a life they have a family they want a future that's the majority along with the believers who will vote trump in because they've already they've seen his witness and testimony is he's already been doing that and so the enemy satan is so terrified because he's planning to take over our country and make it his own and that's not going to happen it isn't i don't care what the news says they don't know how to do anything but lie even the polls i give are like almost insane the polls biden's uh 80 ahead and i went where are the people voting for and who would that be the ones he bought or the ballots they stole no even god says they're stealing even he tells me they're stealing ballots and then they're going to harvest them and thumb and dump dumpsters and i'm going to expose it i mean the enemy is doing whatever he pays off people to vote more than once and states that you could do that i mean they're they're really doing that they are corrupt and they may have been nice loving people one point but when you give yourself to the darkness it will consume you to a point where you're blinded and you don't even know that you just know that you really they really really believe they're going to win because of the news the fake news lying they watch it they believe the lie this is true hillary fainted when she found out she didn't win she knew even though she had no people it's the truth she wouldn't even appear she fainted people had to get psychiatric help because they were convinced in their soul by the lies they believed a lie so when they didn't win they fell apart they sincerely needed psychiatric help and all these years have gone by they're still getting fed with the same lies or more lies they're so so corrupted they even treat their families different some families have been separated business partners businesses have churches have separated my head can't wrap around how can a pastor say to vote for the other side when they want to kill babies oh it is i'm going to always give you the truth this is the truth you cannot side with the darkness and i personally know people sweetest people you ever knew are so filled with hate they hate hate hate trump i can't say his name i can't bring one thing about him and i'm like what happened to you they watch the fake news and and this is the thing they're not just watching it they're believing it the more you believe it is real even on the wrong side the more real it becomes and that's what's wrong with those people believers you cannot choose death you're surrendering authority over the enemy you do when you choose what the enemy wants you watering down your authority you can't you can't choose it's okay to kill you have given authority by christ but you walk in the light remember that walk in the spirit walk in the light follow after him we know what he thinks about it we know what the father thinks about it he's sending these little babies and then the point of time he needs them on the earth satan has a plan this is his plan if i can kill them remember when he killed him first time in egypt remember that he didn't want moses to deliver a person to be mourned so what did he do he killed babies right then the whole abortion thing started because he doesn't want somebody to be born who will have a voice that will speak the truth and the life and the power of god to people so he'll just wipe out as many as he can so that's why that's the truth about why abortion started that was satan's plan just don't let him live don't let him laugh his new thing he's using is homosexuality do you know why that all came up not just to steal people's destinies no babies born this is absolute truth from god he wants to stop god's plans for the people he made so whatever he can bring a lie if you can get people to believe a lie this is really who you are you're not this person you know this your other person well guess what two guys can't have a baby and do women get a baby so the bottom line is he doesn't want him born that's why it's going to be great when abortion is outlawed i've seen the place in heaven where all these little babies are kept and loved and nurtured and if they have family members there they will eventually get these little babies and they get to raise them if their parents make it if their parents were involved in that repent and get born again they get that little baby back that's how good god is that's how good god is so when you see the big or you're getting a big picture how important it is for us to live our life for him not just once a week you go to sleep living for him you wake up living for him running your race powerfully taken power and authority over the enemy wherever there is destruction wherever there is evil you can send the army to pull down strongholds shred platforms because all of the evil on the earth is still is still controlled by satan he finds people who are willing to do it people who don't even know there is a god you know and some other countries is far worse than is here far worse you know evil is or the power of evil unless you go to some of those third world countries america is one of the greatest countries in the world because we're founded by christian principles god is on our papers that's what he says to me all the time one nation under god is one of the lines satan hates the most he don't want him he doesn't want him involved anywhere in our lives or in this country but he isn't going to stop it so we will be a living example here the body of christ in this country of who god is and that he is he does live that christ lives that we have authority over things they're going to see things people will begin to run after christians to be their friend in the in the months and years ahead because they see things happening to them but they realize they're prospering these years of prosperity and in increase of in every way of revelation with the ideas and inventions god's going to give a lot of that to believers so people will have to get get stuff from them so we can't hide we can't run to the hills and hide take vacation but you can't preach this gospel to the bears and raise your children to do the same god is a generational god and children will be powerful in the earth and and there will be a point in this country at least nobody can have abortions it will become [Applause] illegal so god has his timeline and he knows who inside him he's already picked up generations and said you be this you'll be the aunt you'll be the uncle and you'll be in this generation 20 years later this one will be born and will carry this on and carry on generational lines or call on generations and so this is why it's important when he sends them they get to stay amen there is something that happens every now and then because he's god if he sends one and his life gets ended quickly he will take the whole spirit back and rescind it that's probably the first time you've heard that because he has to have that person on the earth he has to have it he even had me share somebody with that that they had a baby uh it was a little a little well i think they they thought it was why they weren't sure and god told me his name and called them and said uh he said he was struggling so he took him but he's going to send him back say he's god they came from him and he does what he needs to whether you miscarried or a baby was aborted um way back in the day when all that stuff kind of started most of the time the young people weren't involved in that it was pressure from the parents that you can't live your life with a baby hanging on whatever the babies the second i will tell you what their their guardian angel which is sent at conception will take them home to heaven and the second of course the little baby spirit leaves the baby body they're not experiencing pain or suffering or anything and they meet personally with jesus when they're taken up to heaven he's got a special place he meets all of these little babies and they actually receive him as their savior even in heaven they don't need to to stay there but they want to they want to and so their love from the moment they're there he has special places for them to play made just even for little babies this big i've seen an angel in the nursery holding five little babies it's going to be in my book three and then from different different ethnic groups and they were just playing in this angel's hand it was precious and he's made this play pond they ride on turtles they can swim under water breathe water they have picnics with jesus they get put in the pockets of the kangaroos and they hop them around take them for rides the nurseries are not don't look like a clinic they're huge nurseries it looks like beehives and the angels fly in and out they have flowers growing all around these beautiful little gorgeous like mother-of-pearl seashells with beautiful blankets in it and the baby's name is over it and the angels who work in these nurseries will hold these babies they sing the breath of god on them nourishes their little baby spirit and then they huh please name your baby that's most important because the angels give them a nickname when they arrive and that nickname is over have been to the nursery several times and uh when the parent decides to name the baby even if somebody wasn't married if the mother can pick a name for that baby pick one that could be either or you know like sydney could be a boy or a girl something like that pick a name because this is what happens the father sends for the baby i get i get over my own he'll send that little baby and he'll say i have a gift your parent just named you so no longer are you going to be called by your nickname this is your name and they have a big party in heaven for this little baby they actually have a cake for it and everything and they celebrate because their parents recognize they were there and that they would be given back people bring little gifts to that baby and and they change the name over the little thing when a grandparent a great grandparent gets home they get that baby they go get the baby they help to play with the baby raise the baby it grows so slowly it could be 50 years later and your baby would still be a baby god is beautiful and he loves his babies that's why he said it would be worse than having a millstone i wouldn't want to be any of the democrats right now it'd be better for a millstone you know how big they are about the size of that world maybe bigger that map a millstone that they would grind things with and it'd be better for you to have one tied around your neck and thrown into the sea than the punishment you will get for doing that i think he doesn't like it and i tell people but because god has a heart of love if you repent for that if you repent for doing that and give yourself to jesus from that moment your baby will be excited they know you got born again they know you're coming to heaven that's all they can talk about as they will be with their family again so yay jesus so i have to say like god would say every life matters no matter what the color of your skin is we came from the same god and he loves all of us and he has plans for all of us in heaven we're a family there's no baptist street you know people always want to put religion on something there's no pentecostal street there's no you know i can't think of the denominations there's no baptist assembly of god there's there's not your mansion is made for you by the way when you come home you come home as a son or daughter you're not coming home as i was their wife you know each other like best friends but you come home as the father's son or daughter so don't worry if you're married three times we're all in heaven you'll have three friends nobody owns anybody and the father did explain this to me i love him because he just opens up revelation to me to share with people there's a reason why you can't be still married when you go to heaven till death do you part because from that moment you're just his son or daughter you don't stop loving the people on the earth but jesus is our number one there's only one bridegroom in heaven and the father said this is why i had to say once you die you come home to heaven not married in heaven you are not married like on the earth on the earth the angels are not married either they're not that's probably a plus for them they're most of them now i know some of them actually wanted to have all spring that way that was a wildest thing to me why would they want to but in heaven the angels are pretty glad they don't have to get married because they watch us but god sends them on assignments i i need a tissue um he sends them on assignments with somebody who's the opposite personality if you've ever been around a comedian you are a very focused thank you once good enough if you're a focused serious person the last thing you want to be with is a comedian you're being sent on assignment right you're here to rescue this person from whatever whatever whatever stop the enemy's attacks on them and this the one angel i just want to wipe them all out let's just wipe them out get rid of them they're done they don't deserve anything and here's the comedian but won't it be fun uh maybe we'll make some new connections while we're down there maybe some make some new friends maybe go have some angel food together somewhere and this other one is tipped off now they don't sin but i mean he is annoyed because this one is rubbing him the wrong way which is the way he doesn't want to go like we do his husband and wife and this could be a long assignment and god's out there saying you just better get along and every now and then they'll send a courier down there you're being watched and notes are being made and you have to realize too these are real beings they have personalities they have assignments they like certain things they have comedians the two that help me write books one is that holy fierce one the other one's a comedian and they do steal rubbish all the fun silly things in the book where stuff the information was given to me by the fun angel the one about hellfire and all the other stuff was given god sent me two scribe angels they came from gabriel and i have my own angel he's 40 foot tall he's behind me last night make sure i don't fall over when you have the life of a seer it's different you see operations on both sides and you can share with people truth that can help them be free but if you're in the flesh you know what happens right to be spiritually minded is life to be fleshy minded is death that doesn't mean god doesn't love you it just means he can't use you a lot if you're always getting in the flesh which growing up all the body knew was to be in the flesh unless you had a move of god that he changed while the move was there moves of god in this time will actually begin to create a habitation that's god inhabiting your whole life so these are profound days serious days but exciting days for us he has really got your life in his hand if you belong to him but don't leave him out of everything make room for a christ in your life every day and i have conversations with him all the time the holy spirit is my teacher who tweaks me a lot and the father just loves me and gives me revelation i wish everybody could experience that it's like life in heaven it's like life in heaven it is it's just like that if you want to be with the father he'll make himself available in heaven to be with you he has this beautiful place he took me two one time i'm like eight years old and he'll say where would you like to go i can take you to the past i can take you to the future and i said i just want to be with you this was my answer from my own soul and he said well you know i can show you powerful things that happen the great days of the great revivals and you want to go see the welsh you want to go visit the welsh revival you want you want to go see this was created on the earth you want to go see time when it was made and i just want to be with you and the third time he said are you sure you don't want to go back and see when you were a little tiny thing in me you don't want to see when i cast lucifer out of heaven because he knows i'm fierce against the enemy i am right where i want to be and that's what he wanted to hear he said well that is what i wanted to hear you say and so then he put his arms around me he can be as big as he wants big enough that the world is a speck of dust in his hand or small enough to step inside himself and play with all the little spirits that's who he is so i've gotten to a place in my life whatever he wants or needs i'm doing it because nothing is worth missing blessing him i've learned the joy of obedience obedience isn't like a heart thing anymore it's a joy to obey because it blesses him when i love people when i share truth when i share revelation i didn't even really like the pink hair but i let them do it so i couldn't hide and these days a lot of people won't be able to hide anymore it'll be too apparent with the glory coming out of you or the fire on your head the fire on your homes people falling out when they pass in front of your house because of the life of god you have there it's because of him you're going to be different not normal not normal and america was designed by god to be a light in this world for his son to come and send two-thirds of the gospel around the world more people give to the gospel from this country than any other nation in the world more people are sent from here to any other nation to the world because of god that's his plan he calls america his gift his son is the greatest gift but he still says america is my gift to the world i'm not giving it to anyone else [Applause] so no matter what this is the thing you need to understand no matter what they say on election day if it's not what you expected just wait and see what happens i never go by what man says i go what god's plans are and he is taking america back amen he's taking it back and from america this world will begin to be changed and show other countries leaders this is the way you run your country justice liberty freedom and righteousness and he will have open doors to some of these leaders that didn't know they could do anything but war and the darkness would be being to be stripped away because of our authority we can't kill satan we can't kill demons but by our living our life and releasing the glory carrying it sharing the truth about the gospel of the kingdom and running after what god wants in our lives there's no way they can escape not knowing something's going on here and then we'll come to america to find jesus christ amen so we all have a commission and even those who don't want him he's gonna get some really stuff hot stuff going right there will be great harvest in this country and great harvest around the world but until he's ready it will not be the end okay so we focus on what we're doing right now what he wants right now and needs right now pray for all those people who've been feeding themselves with lies when trump wins it won't be good for them we'll rejoice and have a party but many people will think their life has ended because of the lies that were told to them and so we're going to break all that garbage let's just stand up and declare together something we'll pray for him right now i do know that eventually i'm not sure when but some of the networks will be taken from them they'll just be taken from them and given to those who will share the truth or who will be at least unbiased i mean the news is always i remember the day when you actually watched the news and it was real news and it's consumed on with hate because the enemy is running it right so he's going to get unseated so right now we all want to declare and pray on election day especially well we're going to thank god for everyone voting because you have to vote don't forget to vote right encourage people to vote uh but we're going to pray for all those on the luck today who have been filling themselves with lies that the enemy would not talk them into taking their life because god did tell me some people would take their life because they're so their layers are so consumed with all of that this is the only life we can have we will not have a life and they'll believe it so we're all going to take authority i'll just lead you into something to declare and then i'm going to release the glory into y'all are you ready for that jesus christ our lord and savior our beloved who saved our soul we honor your holy name we recognize your life that you gave for us we look forward this day and the future to ruin reign with you that is your desire so right now we corporately stand in the gap for those who've believed a lie and who hate without without measure we pray for their souls they will not be consumed with grief when trump wins on november the third we pray god the holy spirit will go to those voting booths and into the homes later to speak to the soul of those people to not take their life that there's still hope for them and we take power over all the power of the enemy has been controlling these lies and these people to bring deception we command the army of heaven to go right now and on election day do you make sweeps around this country depart on every stronghold of satan that is controlling them to shred every platform of high-level spheres of wickedness that would like to take their lives we say in the name of the lord we will not tolerate those actions we will not tolerate the enemy ruining people's destinies we say no more will you control this country or run this country or steal people's destinies this is a time of celebration and greatness and we declare those people who believe the lie will not miss their destiny they will become believers in jesus christ and great witnesses to his salvation so be it in jesus name [Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] oh sit down for just a minute [Music] there's many ways we can do do this importations and there's one of the ways i do it quite often when we have a quite a bit of people i have everybody hold hands it's going to be okay you won't get sick we evict any of that we won't tolerate any sickness in this no we don't tolerate the virus anymore either right we kick it out and evict it from this place only each row not all the way across okay only like this row hold hands just this row i'm gonna come by i'm gonna come by and i'm gonna grab the hand of the person and literally it will flow through every person [Music] i want you to picture i want you to picture this really happens i've done a congregation with 3 000 people like this and you're already sitting so if you have to fall at least it's backwards the glory is the power and presence of the living god it comes in a form of a cloud like light the glory is always talked about as the light or a cloud remember the cloud by day the fire by night they both belong to him they do different things inside of us baptism and fire will burn the whole world off the walls of your soul like it was never there things you things you saw things that bothered you that's what the fire does i've had a measure it came in and hit me so hard when the pastor ladies and i was thrown back into the congregation with a usher a seven foot usher thrown and my body laid on the floor and it shook that's fire okay and and the first time ever angels came and took me back in time my body was there they locked me in with a security guard stuck a note in my sleeve when she wakes up my dad will come and get her call this number i was taken back to the tomb of christ right after the stone had been rolled away i was there at that time if he takes you the time you're there it's not a vision it's not a dream and i have a lot of revelation about his resurrection what that looked like what went on it was really powerful and then he brought me back and all i could do was speak in tongues for two weeks and i had open visions of the fire hitting cities whole cities and congregations is something you don't have to ask people did you get baptism and fire the glory is something that builds in you the more you know him spend time with him obey him this glory he let you carry it for him and let me tell you people will be seeking that out it can sometimes be visibly seen on moses the glory was seen on his face remember that because he was what with god when you spend time with him that glory begins to build in you and it even says at one point the night will be light around us in other words it won't come upon you if you go outside you are the light walking around like people can't escape that what is that light on you what is that you get to share all about jesus and the glory right and then when you get into loose and waves it begins to it will totally wipe out anything of the darkness around people in buildings and that that glory cloud it's a cloud i saw a sole cloud last night just ruling around me the whole time and uh and sometimes you can hear it it's like a shock wave you can hear it and i'm like the first time it happened i'm like wow that person is really anointed i was walking past at the product's table and the holy spirit was just laughing he said go just start walking along the line and where they went they went and i said well this were those people anointed he goes that was coming from you will let you experience releasing the glory and when you take it around the world that's what happens to cities this is for the body of christ so you're going to get a measure of that glory we do it by laying on our hands if i feel like it's not enough i'm just going to mind touch it i might run over top of the rose i don't know what i'll do a greater work is walking on air i've done that you feel nothing but you're walking on it christ walked on water he felt the water walking on years of greater work that awesome this is for us this is who we are it's because of who we belong to who we give ourselves to we have not just promises but we have rights as believers to walk in all of that so i'm just going to start somewhere over here and i will just grab the hand and i'll feel it leaving me i'll feel that leaving me and it just goes down the row i'll go to the next one and you just need to say i'll receive it okay so get ready the ones on the end you're going to be last there's something about being last so y'all ready so we'll go down this road so father right now i just release

and the children some of you have lost children in their young and some of you have lost babies and and although just isn't it heaven every time she shares that story and she even she enhanced it all the things uh just just really powerful i trust it touch your heart for some of you that have been really burdened over those children um the babies the children that um have been abused so the lord's lord's taken care of taking care of his children um thank you lord this is uh this is a very um it's a very powerful time we always love it when cat comes i was talking to pastor brooke last night and he says you know we got to have her come here twice a year at least you guys okay with that if she could come very good very good she could come yeah jen come on you got some oh mama come here for a

them babies camera camera yeah look at those hey that's awesome hey um is there anything you want to say mama yeah we we are just always so blessed to have you here dear and anything you want to tell on cat or you know when she's a kid you know you know we knew she was perfect but anything else you want to you want to say um yes first i want to tell you you've been my church for a whole year now faithfully and i can't wait for sunday to come i just didn't know you were on more than sunday or i've been watching them but i've seen so many of you on the camera and i thought these people are my family and so but but i want to speak now too just for just a few minutes i'll try to make it quick because i'm not i'm really not you're doing good so far i'm not get up here but from the time i was a little girl all i ever wanted to be was a wife little mother and i didn't know the lord in my heart but i talked to him and i told him all i want to be is a mother and a wife and that's all i ever wanted to be so when i got married well i went to church with my grandmother i was raised catholic but i went to church from my grandmother to her old-time methodist church and i got to hear hymns in english so the one that stuck with me was in the garden and i don't know whether any of you even know that old but i i was little and i sat there and i heard them sing he walks with me and he talks with me and i never said anything to my grandma but i thought can you really do that and amazingly even though i went to a catholic school and always went to church in the confession none of it stuck with me not one bit of it it just didn't stick so when i met my husband who was a spirit-filled pentecostal [Music] and i just saw something in him that i knew i had never felt before and an assembly god pastor married us and i wasn't saved but i did he talked with me and i told him my children will be raised in church my husband's church and i will go with him so he went ahead and married us but as i in the first year i had my first baby she was two months early she only weighed four pounds a little bitty thing and i started praying over my babies i prayed over them while i carried them and i talked to the lord and i said all i ever want lord for my children is that they serve you with their whole hearts and i don't care where you call them to go out back the prayer and as they little older when they grow up i gave them back to the lord i said their daddy and i have raised them to know you now they're your your job where you want to send them and i've never held back on one of them and where they want to go so don't ever ever give up on their children if you haven't had children yet start praying for them before you even get them and don't ever back down because i've gone through things with some of my kids and i just always said lord they're yours they're yours they're yours they're yours sometimes you have to give tough love don't back down from that either it may hurt but in the long run you those that you love you chastise that's right it's good so i want to know you to know how much i love all of you and your your praise and everything else you just bless me thank you lord hey mama i want you to do one thing if you have uh and even if you're at home and you have kids that are wayward and uh and they're not serving the lord i want you to stand up we're gonna have mama we'll have mama pray for them and then if you're home well you can buy any of the medias just stand up right there in your home get out of that lazy boy just stand up there very good okay mama pray for him father i'm going to tell them like you told me when i had my wiggler son wandering in the wilderness and you said don't worry i haven't been on my hand and when the time is ripe i'm just going to close that hand and he'll be back where he belongs so don't worry that's one thing that can hinder your prayers that's good don't worry you don't you don't worry if you trust the lord you trust him with your whole heart and no matter how bad it looks you just remind him lord i love you first i love them second but i know you love them more so i'm just trusting you to bring

how important it is for us to be here right now and to have revelation to live by i know we live in this world but we are not of this world we are hovanians first how many people believe life in heaven is better than anywhere else [Music] and everyone who lives there thinks so and i know people picture you know a handful in heaven and a multitude in hell but you're wrong there's millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of people who live in heaven that really got jesus some of it was on their deathbed but they got him some of them you'd be surprised who made it when you get there sometimes i was surprised [Laughter] but i'm here to uh god calls me a revelator if you wonder where that started it wasn't from me most of the things i share are not from me i have to say them because he asked me to say them but i'm a revelator i reveal things and john in the book of john in revelation he also was a revelator and i've had people say the craziest things to me well why do you say that that's not anywhere in the bible there's nothing about revelation in the bible apparently you have not read the last chapter that's not a title or something that's actually something that happened it is a thing it's revelation from the father not from man and if it was important enough to put in the word of god then it's important enough to still share it today and i know i get a lot of revelation i got new stuff today i got brand new stuff today just sitting in the hotel room and jen said one thing to me and a portal open and revelation on what she asked me pour down from heaven um that's not the first time it happened but not not as much as i got it didn't stop it was still going and i finally had to uh stop and go out the hallway of where we were eating in the hotel and just record what he had told me so fonda was so much and one of the things he did talk to me about today was kavanaugh yeah he talked to me about kavanaugh and the supreme court and justice for america and so i will be talking about this wearing my my red word white and blue here and even my boots see they're red white and blue you have me get those i i got these from jones boot company in missouri yes i think they're the second or third largest in america and i know by mentioning their name to give a lot of money to the gospel and i think it's third generation now a very good friend of ours um and a friend of mine daughter and her husband my son-in-law they're very close friends and he recently took over he's young he really recently took over the hogue company they started as a yarn distributor not yarn but twine uh and the holes were said no they didn't sell yarn to bail the hay with i don't know a lot about bailing hay but i know you need more than yarn to tie it all together and they started you know doing that and they're known all over the world really they sell that but then they went into the boot industry and when i do go they sell to me like one-third the price so i have a lot of boots and every time i go there to minister they get me more boots but i wasn't there this last time uh god said why don't you get those with the red white and blue on we like those and i've worn them a lot especially if we're going to talk about america uh heaven wants me to wear red white and blue and i think today they're all wearing red white and blue in heaven if you if you think they're disconnected from the things going on this earth you don't know them they're very much involved in what we are doing because they're all declaring over the destinies of all of us who are here right now those who finished the race and they moved to heaven by the way they didn't get lost you don't need to tell people i lost my father i lost them no they moved that's right you know my father moved to heaven that's the greatest place you couldn't even find it on this earth having more fun than they ever had in their life they're existing to live yeah you know down here a lot of times we feel like we live just to exist okay people some don't understand that i do not believe that you your whole body sleeps when it dies your soul never sleeps not now and your spirit man never sleeps either there's both spiritual things they're wait 24 hours a day and let me tell you they'd be bored in a casket if you went right now and laid in the casket and shot that lid that's what it would be like if all of you stayed there but that's not what happens it's not what the bible says it says to be absent from the body that means something moved out of there right yes it moved out because this is just like a covering this is just a little thing that you know holds all the stuff together inside and uh and right now it's temporary because when you get it back one day it will be glorified it will be supernaturally glorified one day and everyone who lives in heaven knows that's going to happen to them one day and it's going to be fantastic but we have a mission and a commission right now on this earth to do things never done before we are a supernatural people a supernatural generation living on this earth that was made by the god that we love and that we serve and they're all excited up there about this country now i will assure you he loves the world the world and the fullness thereof belongs to the lord it does and he is also very interested in what's going on he still comes down here a lot he appears to a lot of people get messages to people he actually does it to me a lot also so it's not like he moved up there and just stayed there forever he does go back and forth a lot he does come in himself and say things to people he's appearing to the jihad so how about that's that's that that is the the i guess the most i don't know how to speak to introduce them to you but they're not normal muslims i'll just tell you that uh the jihad many of them are interested in wiping out a lot of stuff on the earth they don't know god they don't know jesus christ but he is in person coming to them and there are a lot of them getting saved it's part of shifting nations right now and so nothing is going to seem to be impossible and even what happened in the supreme court a lot of people would say that was never going to happen i knew it was going to happen because i do know god's plans for this country and i'm telling you it's going to be fantastic to live here and at the end of 24 years it will not even look like or sound like like the same country it will be beyond better than it was [Applause] everywhere in this nation in the most unexpected places and i'm telling you he's coming to consume us in this nation he's going to make an example for other nations to follow if they want god amen that's the pattern if they want god and they want success they want employment for their people if they want their people to be free to be safe to be prosperous then god's going to make our country an example of that because of him amen and so we've been very much involved in the last elections and i'm excited about november i'm excited about the midterm elections it's going to be just like it was before it's going to turn the map red and i know uh if you watch the fake news and let me tell you this people if they were smarter they wouldn't be beating everyone up and accusing them wrongly you know they they don't even know what they're doing in today's society with the internet with twitter you know with the podcast however we are we're available everywhere 24 hours a day you can talk to people you know on this online everything everybody posted but you can't hide it anymore and that's really a good thing because god can't be hidden anymore and the righteous things can't be hidden and justice and freedom cannot be hidden what's being done right can no longer be hidden by the other side that doesn't want anything good really i'm sorry for them sometimes that they they can't see what they're doing or saying they're hurting their self and they and what their plan is would hurt generations even more than what we have been affected already and so that's why god put someone in the white house who knew what to do in the situation who wouldn't back down wouldn't be bought you know couldn't be used couldn't could not you can't put fear in him and i tell people tonight don't waste your time anymore you're not going to impeach him not ever he will be there for eight years whether anybody likes it or not well heaven likes it and i remember when god said from the time he takes the the seat in the white house america will not have one boring day and we haven't have it and you know god did anoint him to influence because the influence he has is for good yes it is for good he gives a space for god whether you know it or not he does know him he's still new in that but he does he as we see jesus christ as the savior i'm talking about our president and he's very focused on not letting god be shut out of our country and that alone is just that the blessings that come upon our country just because he recognizes there is a god and this country belongs to god and i don't know how many times he's already said god bless america god bless the people and i still think one of the most famous things he said and his acceptance speak to us i'm here to give your country back to you and i don't remember any other president ever saying i'm here to give your country back to you because you know i don't think a lot of people remember it's for the people by the people yes is that right yeah and so we do have a lot of say i've never in my life gotten so many texts and surveys never in my life from you know you think this solicitor at your door you know or all these other people calling you on the phone to take uh you know asking to do surveys uh our president has asked me for more than any other company i know in america has a has sent me a surveys on my phone all the time and emailed it to me and texted it to me and if you're giving me your number you're going to get text i'll tell you that about everything and so he definitely is what god said he was that he's an all-american boy who was all for america and i won't ever stop talking about it because god won't let me stop talking about him he said my voice is going to be heard of what i think what i plan and what is actually going to happen yes and don't listen to what anyone else says because i have the final word that's my that's my my boy this that i put in the white house and he said i made him a certain way and he was out of all of the people in the land right now anywhere in this country he was my choice amen he said i will back it up and the people will love him even though some may not like that they'll still benefit from it and there's already been like two million jobs created amen and our borders are safer they're going to get safer and i can tell you that part of the other side wants no borders whatsoever that's not wise everybody say that's not wise i don't want that do you want that no i don't either because it it protects us right right we're not a mean hateful special country you can come in legally yeah we don't say you can't come you come illegally so we know who is criminals and who are not criminals who are terrorists who are not terrorists because there wouldn't be much of a country left amen so we have some really good solid plans uh that would be god and and our government right now has some really good solid plans for this country and i'm really excited about it uh the prosperity the joy the celebration uh the holidays being brought back i will be celebrating christmas in a big way we make a birthday cake for jesus we've always done that when i was growing up we had a birthday cake for jesus he likes some honey in it by the way but he does love sweets and if you have a sweet tooth blanket on him or joint heirs with christ remember that who would have ever thought one thing i have found out in my many encounters that i have in heaven with god i mean before it was always jesus who would walk through the walls of my home and he'd have me sit down and he would say things to me like face to face like i'm looking at you and uh i had not ever got accustomed to that and still get undone but when the father comes you know uh they have the same heart they have that same holiness in them but when the father comes himself it does something to the inside of me that my dad my my permanently always daddy where i lived and who who took care of me and held me and it says in the bible that he was called you know he's called the mini-breasted when i'm talking about the father he carried us inside of him like a mother carries the babies in the womb and i love the little things he would tell me that he would tell to a little child anywhere he said you know i put water in the womb of the mother so it'd be something that would be familiar to that baby because when you lived in me you played in the river of life inside of me i never thought of that not ever in a million years would i have ever and yeah i knew that i mean i knew that there was water it protects the baby it keeps the float you know there's all reasons why we have and i have birth three children so i understand all that and uh but i never considered the fact even knowing the river of life was inside the father and it flows out of him it's never ending you can't see where it comes from at all but it's it's never ending and we would play inside we would swim we'd swim under the water run on top of the water jump on the stones of fire he has this massive mountain the highest line i've ever seen was inside him and we would run and slide down that mountain from the water flowing in it then we would jump on the stones of fire and we played we played like little children we played we didn't have to decide what we were going to eat where we were going to live you know what we were going to do and then we could move out we would jump on the rays of the rainbow to come from inside them they would jump on and we would ride in and out on those rays of the rainbow because in him we lived we moved we had our very existence and so and that's what that talks about in the scripture we came from him everybody came from the same place we all all people whoever were born on this earth lived in him first it said in the bible he knew us before we were born you know he would talk to us he would play with us because we lived in him that's how he could see us that's how he could know us he wrote every day of our life in the book before he sent us how about that and there's other scrolls in heaven that talk about the plans he has for you and sometimes you'll be partnering with the host of heaven or maybe with gabriel's group and helping to bring the body parts down a gabriel's group bring those body parts down a lot of people have prayed them down you know and and really that's necessary for us to do that we have to invite heaven that's why we invite jesus christ yes you need to get jesus without asking him to come in is that true this is some of the most powerful revelation i was ever given when i was in heaven when he caught me up to heaven he said there is a protocol you must invite you have to invite my son for him to come live in you you're going to invite the holy spirit to come and indwell you and he says so when you invite that gives us permission to do something with that invitation you have to invite the host of heaven to be one of your personal weapons that will war against the enemy and pull down the strongholds around you put on strongholds of darkness and uh so there's new revelation that plan of god that we will actually help complete the destiny of the armies of heaven he's already always had that plan while we lived in him we weren't even here the earth wasn't even here he made plans for that because see the the armies of heaven can't just go attack wherever they want to they're an army our army well unless trump's over yeah anyway most armies just can't go attack what they feel like well this is basically we're going to take our own weapons without any orders from headquarters we're just going to go attack wherever we want to that would not make sense down here are the military no matter what military or what country they all pretty much have the same way they handle that they have officers over them but first they train them is that right they get trained and i tell people all the time this is a good way to explain it to you you want to be an airline pilot you go apply with delta or american airlines you're not going to walk in the next day and get your license i wouldn't fly on that plane our lives as believers it's the same thing but the angels in heaven it is the same way they have a protocol of how they operate in heaven the government of heaven the army of heaven and gabriel's all the watcher angels and the healing angels and the body parts angels worker angels scribes i can i can make a whole long list that are under gabriel one of the guardian one of the um my mind's going now uh one of the archangels thank you holy spirit um the archangels are fantastic they have a higher level of understanding of knowledge inside of them because they're over like whole groups of angels and the hosts actually prefer to be called the host when it says a great host in the bible that's the army okay it talks about angels and leaders of angels that's usually gabriel's group and gabriel's work look beautiful most all of gabriel's the angels under him look like us you probably couldn't tell sometimes if it was an angel or not they can hide their wings many times i have i don't have arguments but people try to argue with me that angels don't have wings because i've seen them and they don't have any and so you didn't see all of them okay you didn't see all of the all almost every angel i've ever known or seen which is probably billions of angels at this point they all have wings some are made out of energy some are made out of color some are made of light you know we always think they have to have feathers you know like a bird and if they don't have them they don't have them but they're probably invisible some can have them when they need them and not have them i have news for you the father has wings so there's jesus he came with healing in his he does he doesn't always show them he does have wings mighty wings the father has powerful mighty wings you know about psalms 91 right he has wings holy spirit has wings the holy spirit is huge he's really tall i have never seen him he's invisible but he does have an appearance it's the best way to describe him i used to ask god how do i describe him he lives in me i hope he lives in you holy spirit lives in me he's my best friend yes and i thank him all the time the most simplest things i need or i can't find or i don't know he'll show me bring it to me or tell me without me even asking and so he talks to me 24 hours a day gets on to me a lot that's what best friends do right yes and he's also god i don't know why people want to put him in a different category he's god he can be worshipped he can be praised and so he's part of the trinity they're all holy they're all the godhead and they are uh even though their parents may differ a little bit their heart is the same they are for us they are not against us they have more hope for us than anyone else in existence and so uh they're fantastic to to get to know i want everyone here to know them you know in a in a really awesome way and but their goal always is for us to be greater to be more prosperous to have their heart to have their understanding to know their ways to want their will it's really important to have those things if you're going to be successful in this world and when you get to that place the devil will be terrified of you he's already afraid of you he doesn't attack you because he's angry he attacks because he is very afraid he's afraid you'll become you will become more and more like them amen he really is he doesn't want you to have revelation he doesn't want you to know how to be greater he doesn't want you the devil doesn't want you to know how to go in the spirit realm and or execute the government of god on this earth or how your soul to prosper especially he's most terrified that he does not want your soul to prosper he doesn't want you to live in divine help he doesn't but that's just too bad because in this time it'll be normal to operate just like that that your soul will continue to prosper every day that it will not be filled with doom and gloom with violence with anger with offense all those things come from the enemy and the less you have them the more terrified hell is of you and the more blessed god is in heaven so in my life i love to bless the lord i love to bless the father and i love to bless the holy spirit i greet them every morning when i wake up that's the first thing i say and then i kiss my husband goodbye so he can go fishing and he goes fishing and spends time with god that's how he spends his time with him i mean if it's 14 15 hours and smell like bait when he comes home not my favorite thing but really you can have as much of them as you want as much as you will choose to pursue them and we get so busy in this world just trying to live sometimes we forget them unless we really need something and it's okay to ask for help and you need help but the whole purpose for us to have the host of heaven the armies of heaven at our personal disposal to use is so you won't be running to them all the time asking them to rescue you to keep you safe because we have that ability because of christ to do that ourself because we're going to a new level we can't live the same place we were before you can't we go from glory to glory that means you're going to a higher level of knowing them a higher level of dominion and authority a higher level of prosperity a higher level of the glory that is an upward movement that means you can't stay here we can't be down here anymore being crushed by the enemy he is under our feet [Applause] i'm gonna make doormats and say hell is our doormat that's the way we need to think if we always walk around filled with fear or confusion or anger then we can't go to those levels so that's why god is sending some of the greatest revelation this is my introduction i'm going to talk about america but this is the holy spirit's introduction i'll just say that the holy spirit always has an introduction because there's always new people who how many people this first time you've ever heard me anybody bless them jesus just take your natural mind and set it on a shelf you'll be fine because i talk about spiritual things now i walk in the spirit amen so i don't walk in the flesh i don't have personal opinions i have their revelation and i live by it i can't tell you these things if i have not lived them myself and it does make a difference but what i'm sharing to you is a lifestyle it's not a cafeteria if you can live on earth like they do in heaven that means you'll have to make some changes in your life you walk in the spirit what does that mean that's a place it's a place by the way new revelation john was in the spirit why did he say that why did that why didn't even get put in the bible why was that in the bible they could have just said he heard and was caught up that's not how it starts he was in the spirit it was the way he lived how he processed god the way he responded to everything he lived a spiritual life that doesn't mean you walk around so you know so serious and sour and that's not even what holy is holy is absent of sin it's an absence of sin that's not hard amen so john lived this way that he would hear the voice of the lord he always obeyed he was always willing to do what he wanted and he kept him on this earth he could still be here if he wanted to but he missed heaven remember he went there you never forget it when he was caught up so he was in that that place in his heart he was in the spirit on the lord's day and when they because they said that i don't think he was even on the isle of patmos that was supposed to be his prison they put him there because they were so afraid of him they couldn't kill him they tried more than three times they tried to kill him all the time it never worked it never worked because this was what god was doing with him he was allowing him to stay here as long as he wanted he would fill him with things all the time so he was already sharing and doing what god had told him and i'm sure what jesus taught him he would go in the spirit in the spirit realm and he would appear before the sanhedrin when he felt like it even after he was sent to the alabamas they didn't want him to talk to people they didn't want him around people he was way too weird they couldn't kill this guy you know what are we going to do we need to put him somewhere so we're safe he couldn't make you know any interruption or disruption which happened every time he would appear somewhere he already had that revelation of going in the spirit and so he was in the spirit on the lord's day and that door open he heard that voice he recognized that voice and then he was taken up and saw heaven saw god the father sitting on the throne with the rainbow around him he saw him [Laughter] and so he was showing him he saw the very person that he would say in the book of john you cannot see the face of god and live and yet in the book of revelation he saw him and saw the face of god and lived because this was about a new relationship when you receive jesus christ you can see the face of god and live you can see it you're not going to be any different when you go to heaven if you have christ in you then you're righteous you have entrance into heaven not just when you die sometimes god will catch people up even even unsaved people just so they can have an encounter and they freak out they come back and then they want to receive jesus christ that's happening a lot too he's not just catching up believers and so you can have an encounter with the living god with jesus christ the holy spirit a lot of us have already had he's definitely strange he loves drama in case you wonder why we have drama when we receive the holy spirit there's a lot of drama i love a story that was told a long time ago i think it was probably back in the 50s 40s and this church was experiencing the holy spirit just moving on everybody but their pianist was the most proper person in the church and she wore white every sunday to show how holy she was and she sit there and play the most common alcohol tunes on her organ and she was never moved or touched and everybody was like falling out there rolling on the floor they were speaking in tongues you know and she thinks i'm just going to remain rapper until one sunday church was passed they all wanted to come and see what was going on and the holy spirit just totally invaded her she jumped off of the off of the bench and did flips she hit the pipe of the wood stove sit like a cloud came over her it covered her white outfit all the way to her feet stuck in her hair it got on her face she went up and down the aisle just yelling in tongues back and forth did not care at all so there was drama in that church that day that's right this is a true story and she never was the same after that she loved everybody she's saying she's singing tongues sometimes you know and so let me tell you you can try to avoid it all you want to but they're going to come a day when the spirit of god would touch all flesh amen without permission in the last days i will pour out my spirit on what and people who never prophesied before never had visions before never dreamed they're going to do it that's right it could be people walking out of walmart get hit by the holy spirit this is the picture you need to have not just everybody sitting in a church and happening it's going to happen in the streets in the restaurants in the grocery store you know the holy spirit's not going to go oh i should wait until they come out now he's the most excited being in all existence right now the greatest show on earth will be when the spirit of god is loose on all [Applause] and people who know flesh a believer they'll all be beating your door down calling you on the phone what just happened to me what happened what happened what happened i can't stop shaking i'm crying i'm laughing i need to know who jesus is i know you know him yes it's going to happen it hasn't happened yet the baptism in fire is going to come right after that that is a separate baptism yes it's the fire that comes from god the father himself it will not be very long away i don't have dates for everything but i can tell you this just because of what's already happening in the world and there's signs that you will see signs that things are changing and it's not going to be the same well the very trump got elected was a sign okay something new is happening god's actually going to do exactly what he wants no matter what the whole world is saying no matter what comes up against him it's just not going to make any difference because you're fighting god and all those democrats were fighting god about kavanaugh because god was on his side he wants change in the justice department so god has a lot of things that that are just starting on the earth for the first time yeah and we get to do that yes he's not just going to do everything himself he wants you to do them now you probably thought your whole life you're going to sit on a seat and go home and have a good sunday dinner and watch football or you know go play with your kids or whatever you do and then i'll go back next sunday your life won't be like that anymore you won't it'll be a lot more exciting it'll be powerful there'll be many things required of you and in order for you to carry the glory the absolute power of the living god yes to when you walk into places things are shifted like hundreds and thousands of people like land where nothing grew before produce will come up you go out and stop the earthquakes and then they can put it back you raise the dead that will cremate it yes these are greater works see all these are things that are mentioned in the bible but i think some pastors forget them because a lot of them are just talking about escaping and that's not what's going to happen that's why the holy spirit told me to make things that said roll up your rapture rug remember the first time you said okay you're going to the church are you going to say tell everybody roll up the raptor rugged one okay roll up your rapture rug he said i didn't tell you to occupy that that's not money man jesus said occupy until i come that doesn't mean go sit somewhere in the woods with the raccoons and the sea rations and it doesn't mean sitting under wraps or rugging your corn or not doing ever doing anything but waiting to get out of this awful place he expects us to change it with the power of god revelation us surrendering our life you know when you get saved when you get born again the light of god is put in you your name is written in this massive book in heaven the book of life the angels always record it when people get born again they're always recording it as evidence they take it to heaven they don't have to but they want to god takes a stone of fire from himself and puts it in your spirit man and that's when you have light that's where the light comes from jesus takes a portion of his anointing a measure of the anointing walking on the earth and he deposits it in you that's in first down 227 if you wonder where that is so you get something you get deposits and things put in you to make you supernatural and then it gives you revelation especially when there's a new time we have new ways we have understanding of our weapons if we have been using them that armor of god he told you to put on it is powerful if you're going into a strange place where you know people use like really bad language or stuff going on before you go in that door you need to lift up my shield of faith it will block and quench every fiery dart of the enemy those are words propane words like people screaming yelling hating it won't penetrate you that's what that shield does all of those parts of your armor are important but when you have revelation they're even more powerful and now he's adding on top of that the the destiny of the army of heaven to operate as our weapon and we command them because god himself said command he me he didn't say tell me what to do what he was saying was you say what is going to happen if we are kings and priests we have authority we have a voice to speak we have a voice to speak into the atmosphere into the spirit realm against any evil no matter where it is we have power over all the power of the enemy he gave us powerful weapons his word is powerful his name the demons hate his name they remember who he was and he wasted hell on the third day and noted the faces of the principalities and powers and they can't change it they can't fix themselves when something happens from a born-again powerful believer filled with jesus christ you are dangerous that and i know you i talk a lot about the authority because the body needs to know they have it yes and i could talk about all the love of god and i did that for years how much you love them he believes your father you know he wants he wants you to know his mercy and his goodness and he does he wants you to be blessed beyond measure and he does but he wants to know the other part of it jesus is a warrior he's a king right now i don't picture him as a little a shepherd holding a little lamb in his arms anymore i see him with those crowns on his head and his flings of fire and that sword that comes unless you divide things asunder i see him that way he is my king he is the king of spiritual kings we are the spiritual kings [Music] so this is a new lifestyle for you what i share with you is not just one little thing that's going to help you or another little thing if you live without revelation it's a lifestyle i mean the host of heaven hearken unto the voice of the lord and he's in us when we speak and give them commands to go do things put on strongholds of darkness crush it push it back they do it because they recognize that voice in us but if you as a believer are playing in sin you may as well put an ego target on you you're going to get tapped that's right you can't go forward in the kingdom that's right and then you step back by playing or partnering with help you're stepping back you see that you're stepping back and you're flashing into the way you were before and you're partnering with the enemy well that means man they were beating me up now i'm coming after them yes that's right someone actually asked a question at our table why do i get attacked a lot i feel like they got a big target on me well i i didn't answer that question but my first thing was how have you been living have you been treating people what have you been saying what's in your layers good because you have to be filled with the light like we we are the kingdom of light we are against the kingdom of darkness so if you get sucked into that kingdom of darkness that means you stepped back and you are not fit for the kingdom is that what that scripture says if you go forward in the kingdom don't step back or you will not be fit for the kingdom it's like an athlete who's practicing for the olympics for like 10 years they've been doing they finally get their time three months away and they decide i'm just going to stop all this i'm tired of practicing i don't want to practice i don't want to do this i'm tired i'm taking a break do you think they would win in the olympics they wouldn't be any use to themselves or their team they would not be fit to compete that's what he means when he says you will not be fit for the kingdom because your level of authority went down when you gave it away to the enemy that's that's not god doing that that's your choice with your will amen so don't step back if you go forward with this you got to keep going forward heaven is a forward motion it's not a back and forth i'm going here and i'm going to go back and i'm going here oh no i got to go back and he'll forgive you for all of it to forgive you always but he can't put you back up here if you were there and you step back either by going into sin or by hating people and bashing and crushing them all the time that's not heaven's words you're not giving life it says choose life or death you're giving death so that means you're stepping back then the place you were in going forward in the light you're making conquest sending the host to put on strongholds mess up the isis they get messed up you can't go forward and and the host will listen to you as long as you're going forward in the light and there's not darkness in you because they can't partner with darkness they were sent by the lord they are a weapon a mighty weapon to the pulling down of strongholds we don't fight the enemy we're already conquerors that as kings and priests and the kingdom we do have an army amen it's the nose no difference in our own military if we had great generals and they were getting all these troops to go forward making conquest taking land taking territory and they decided to go partner with the very enemy they're fighting and they give out secret information and tell for well some of our troops are stuff like that do you think they are going to be any good to this military that they've been taking forward we have to see it that way that we can no longer participate with the enemy and do not let fear rule you that's right that's right one of the reasons why our president is so successful is he does not have fear in him he doesn't have fear he's made major plans everything within his being wants to see those plans happen he really loves his country and he really loves the people and just because people have twisted and lied about but he doesn't care what they're saying he's not wasting his time he's not running back trying to pull out stuff no no no no he is going forward which terrifies the enemy and we should have an example we have jesus christ for example but our very president should be an example to all of us if you want to achieve the destiny and the goal you have in your life you can't let everybody here or here pull you back drag you off the path get you caught into other things you have to stay focused amen and have fun while you're doing it that's right man so today the victory that happened in our country and this is what that victory meant all of heaven is celebrating kavanaugh being put on the supreme court this is why they're celebrating and i'm sitting there god says pouring this all stuff into me and i watched it when they confirmed him and i kept telling people i don't care what they're saying i don't have time to listen to the other side i don't i know that god has positioned this country for greatness for blessings for justice which is written on one of the steps of his very throne the word justice is there this is our season and time for justice especially as believers but also for our country this is a time of justice liberty and freedom and that's what he stood for that's what kavanaugh stood for and so they found someone to pay them to lie with not one shred of evidence no evidence even his own children did not believe the lies about him they lived with him they knew his character they knew that he loved god and god picked him like he put trump and he kept telling me i don't care what they say he is sitting on the supreme court he's going to wipe out rogue versus way he's going to give life to baby and when i'm sitting there today in the hotel room he kept showing me letting me see all these millions of babies who have been aborted and have hearings that are in heaven they sang and celebrated as they were saying yes he was going to sit on the screen this is what they knew that life would change for all the babies in america that no longer illegal to take their lives and wipe them away like dust like they had that and they have forgiven all those people there's no anger in their little souls they're free they forgive everybody the people who performed it the people who allowed it the people who voted for that to be legal they forgave every person but today they had a party in heaven and they celebrated the other babies being conceived in the womb one day we'll never have to fear the life being taken and they'll get to complete their destiny on this earth so there was a big party in heaven today because of that and then and the father began to tell me he said yes we now have there is now god in the white house because he's welcomed and allowed to be there and he said and now i have permission to be in the supreme court because of cavanaugh as a believer being sit on that vent sitting on the bench of the supreme court he said now i have the right to speak into the court system and he said because of that i have assigned three special ops angels see i'll never just tell you something you're going to get details he has a sign of three powerful angels host of the host and they're called their names are justice liberty and freedom and they are assigned to protect and keep kavanaugh on his family and they're also assigned to help him bring justice liberty and freedom to this country in the supreme court and he said he was just the first put in there he said there are more to follow and everyone that's nominated will win the nomination he said because i'm involved in that amen so this is really a time for us to celebrate god's hand moving again divinely moving against all the stuff that was manufactured paid to happen and as much as possible they would spend all their time on the fake news telling the fake stuff and it didn't stop it it didn't stop it from happening god said and again in the midterm elections that map will be turned red amen okay because i did not invest myself in trump and putting him in the office only to have halfway through his term have everything taken away he said that it will not happen so there's some prophecy for you going to be great you just have to watch stop watching jumps and a lot of people do not understand they think the whole end is here we actually had somebody i don't know if they message me or commented i don't know what they did um what the hell they said it to me they said that you are absolutely wrong you need to stop talking about all these good things happening because this is the last day and there is no time for those things to happen i want to say maybe not on your clock or calendar but we're living on god's timeline right now amen and i said i will not ever stop saying these things because they will happen yes amen god's going to make sure his voice stays spoken in this world so you know what's going to happen amen you should hear him that clearly if your heart is to pursue him to have that you're going to have it you can't escape having his voice you can't he's not a respecter of persons we all have the ability to prophesy the bible say all they prophesied does that say that yes so he said desire the best gifts that's a best gift you hear how god's voice and then speak it for him and let me tell you go how do i know he's saying something you feel like you're going to explode inside yeah it really does happen that way when i first started doing that it would like begin to burn and then it felt like my whole body was going to explode and the longer i waited to say something and the whole time the holy spirit is saying open your mouth open your mouth i don't know what to say open your mouth you gotta open your mouth step up and open your mouth there were no real lessons about that but i just honestly say open your mouth and say it to whoever it's for and make sure it's supposed to be spoken sometimes god shares things with you so you can pray right so you have to discern is this something that i can say in love that will help them change or am i wanting to do this because my flesh is really happy i can bash them god doesn't bash he shares he gives correction and then direction but he does it in love man so what i have is good news i have good news for us good news for america and not only that the countries he's shifting around this world like korea and that will be one land it will be one country without communism or a war people are thinking that's just not going to happen without a war i went yes it is it will happen because this is god's plan and if he can shift the mind and the focus of that north america north korean president then it will happen and while i was in korea i was there to do eight meetings in 10 days i lost like 15 pounds yesterday seafood yes the brazil nuts were really good the pretzels brazil nuts and oranges is what i ate for 10 days but they were delicious as long as i didn't have to eat the tea [Laughter] and god said i'm going to date him this is back before i'm going to bait he just called him kim i'm going to bake him with big business and everybody's going to wipe him out and get him off the face of the earth or else he would do that himself actually god said if i wait much longer he may blow himself up because their stuff doesn't work well he didn't want him to blow himself up he was not happy with what he's doing but guess what his soul was filled with that stuff by his own father it was filled from the time he's little war war war war war and so what did he know war he didn't know what well but that's what he knew so god said i'm going to shift his heart and focus to big business and he will want to do the business when he sees it so he used the olympics as bait here's south korea making millions of dollars from people all over the world coming to see those olympics and when the person who sent there to check it out came back and said do you know what there is no fear they don't have fear all those people coming to visit and they're all applauding and yelling and cheering and they're spending money and spending money and spending money but no one's afraid because they're happy they're celebrating something we don't even think about i don't think they had a team did they anyway they weren't thinking in that way because the mind of their leader was not even considering that would be possible he was actually in fear that's why he was always wanting a war and wipe out people before they got and he was living with fear in him and god said i'm shifting him to consider doing big business and that's what his focus is he still has a lot of changes i'm not by any means saying he is perfect but his focus has shifted amen and if people don't like it they've been around him they won't last very long because he already has seen evidence that you can have a different life so don't don't consider don't just consider that no one you know all things are possible with god and that's not the only country he's going to do that to he's going to shift governments and then when he shifts the government he will shape the nations and doors will open for us to go and share the gospel where we never could before and it's going to be a long window not a short few weeks or months there's people that believe what i say but there's one thing they don't agree with they think that the rafters coming in about three months but they said that six years ago i went just no we don't want to discuss that right now i'm discussing what is the now time of god that's the future you can't change it you can't make it happen you don't know that day so how about if we just agree together to do what god wants us to do now amen amen so one of the focuses on heaven is to shift nations that is by reaching the leaders of those nations or removing that leader and putting one in there that will be shifted so you're going to see a lot of activity around this world especially in governments and some of them may not be the ones you expected to do something but korea is a good example because this i know there's wars and rumors of wars there'll be more rumors than wars and when something like that happens it won't be a long one because the other side will be dealt with swiftly and quickly because this is a different time on the earth well how can you talk like that because it's what god is saying this is what he wants now we're not living the way we did 50 years ago or even 20 years ago we're not living that way we have a whole new way we could live called heaven culture and there's a way you live that we're not automatically just going to be showered with little fuzzy things and the next day everybody's going to live on earth like they did in heaven we have to be living examples of that and people will see our lives we'll be a living testimony on this earth and you can have a life like they do in heaven and what is that like no fear no wars no hate no laugh no sickness no disease excitement joy celebration adventure the presence of god everywhere in your life that's the way they live in heaven that's heaven culture honor is given to people no one is rejected there's no offense there's no regrets there's no worry about regrets in heaven no one's going to be feeling feel like that they were crushed down because they didn't do right on this earth you remember your life but you use it to the glory of god and what he did and how much he loved you to make sure you got there amen amen so this is this is a whole new time and he's not saying you can't come if you're in this denomination if you have to be in this denomination too common to be a part of this otherwise you just can't come that's not from heaven either no there's one requirement if you receive and believe in your heart that jesus christ died for your sins and you repent for those sins and he washes you inside with a shower of his blood and wipes all that away like it never happened and you are counted righteous and your name is written in the lamb's book of life then your whole focus should change with god's focus on you because people who are not believers cannot do these things they do not have power over the part of the enemy the host will not listen to anyone who is a non-believer they're not going to listen to them they can see inside of everybody you either have light or you have gray or you have darkness in your soul that's what's there there's either light darkness or gray you don't want gray amen and the enemy because those are spiritual beings they see spiritual things about you now i don't give them any ammunition i'm not giving them any ammunition i have ammunition i'm going to focus on them but with all that you get with what god has planned for us right now you also can have uh your greatest desires in your heart yes that are for good it will be his pleasure to give those to you amen when you start operating like this when you start pursuing heaven culture your needs become this is what he personally told me your knees become his responsibility and your desires become his pleasure the people living in utter darkness who don't know any of this they see no hope they don't even think they have a future that's why it's important for us to be a living testimony amen and we live in one of the greatest countries in this world we do another country's focusing on is is of course israel and i knew something major was going to happen in israel god said i'm going to bless them every time they get attacked every time someone threatens to attack them i'm going to bless israel they're going to walk in favor with me divine favor with me and i will give great friends who are jews to americans who know me and they will do big business together and jews know how to do big business trust me he said i will bless them above measure and it will protect them and it will keep them they will not be wiped out he said america belongs to me and now the greatest friends is the the one who who is over israel the one who's over america are now great friends together and so both blessed both will be greatly blessed because of this so you can see more blessings coming and for the first time in a long time because a lot of the warring has stopped because now of course you know of course our embassy's over there and israel's embassy has been shifted to where it should have always been yeah and i mean trump pretty much said if you attack them you're attacking us we will come after you because he's he is serious about being friends with his not going to give billions of dollars away to our enemies amen so justice is coming to this country to our lives and there's a whole atmosphere of justice that was actually just shifted into our country because of the supreme court more and more you will see justice for believers who get dragged into court who have court cases uh and they're innocent more and more you will hear because in the past you'd always hear they've either taken it somewhere else you're going to retry it they found something else you actually hear real justice being given to them amen so this is a real powerful time a time to celebrate and to be joyful for us and if you have family members that don't like you know our president just pray for them and let them love them and let them live their life they're still going to benefit from all of it anyway and i have found this to be true you yourself probably can't change their mind a lot of people wear themself out trying to prove to their family members that they need jesus and it's probably going to be someone else in this world that does that not you pray for them hug them love them let them know you love them you're praying for them but don't get into fights every time you come together okay make sure you have time for love for family and you may notice a little bit of change in them if they don't think every time you come it's going to come up get in your prayer closet send the host of heaven against the demonic trying to control their lives release the anointing into them that's what breaks the yoke of darkness over them there are things that you can do but don't waste your whole life that's right you know trying to convince somebody that doesn't want that you cannot make them take it amen it has to be a choice i do know that major restorations are coming from families who've been apart for years and you may see a lot of that happening this christmas especially this christmas god's marking is a time a major time for restoration and family members to break down those barriers between them so you can expect to hear about that happening or you might have that happen yourself that god's in that time in in that christmas christmas season will be a time of great restoration for families in this earth so and heaven does heaven does like christmas by the way [Music] you wouldn't make christmas town in heaven if you've never heard the truth about uh nicholas and how he lived his life when he was on this earth you don't really know what he was like he was not a necessarily the happiest person in the world he was tough he was hard and he did not like anyone who spoke against the gospel he would take his staff and use it for other purposes yes go watch saving christmas oh yeah i think um kirk cameron kirk cameron made a movie called saving christmas everybody should look that up and watch it you should watch it he tells the true story he tells the true story about nick or nicholas and how his life was back in his day and it is quite humorous but it's quite true and you see a whole different way to explain christmas or celebrate christmas but god loves it he loves all the lights he likes the gift giving he loves the fact that sometimes it is the only time in someone's life that they forgive yes it is sometimes it's the only time of the year that they actually give money to others to help them amen it is really it's not something bad that link everything to some satanic ritual that was way back when but i have news for you heaven was there before all that stuff was here and all the enemy did was he takes it he copycats it and so that it looks like it's all evil when he's taking something that's good that's from god and he hates god so in any way he can make something look bad he never makes anything look good except sinning so a lot of the things that he says that everybody thinks now halloween that belongs to satan that's right don't celebrate it for the same reason i would tell you to you know get on heaven's side look up all right uh all those evil practices they show in in the halloween it is satan's highest day of the year and he wants people to celebrate his images and and it also brings fear into people especially children and you do draw things to you so you don't want to wear any kind of image that belongs to the enemy and i don't mind if you don't want me to say that anymore you don't want to hear me anymore don't listen to it but i'm telling you truth because i'm a seer and i see the things that follow those kids down the street when they're wearing like ghoulish things or demonic things you're saying come on yes because you're wearing your image that's right amen so everybody's listening everybody here do not celebrate that day and one day we will our company have a festival of light on that same day and we will celebrate heaven on that day and we'll celebrate life and joy and happiness and goodness and uh we are going to make calendars and on october 31st on that calendar it will say celebrate life we will not honor even mention the other side amen and i know my dad will tell us all the time don't go out and do that well my mom would let us because she was never churched or anything and my dad would pray and pray and pray that we would never be affected by it he just had a connection to heaven and eventually i saw it being you see i'm like okay i could tell you dad what i saw and after that we wouldn't we wouldn't do it anymore we would give stuff out we didn't shut our door and shut people out we would give them a track with a piece of candy when they came to the door okay we'd have it wrapped around or is a part of it we would give it to them they're not gonna throw it away okay they'll take it home drive it home take it out of their bag and it'll be put somewhere but somebody might see it so we do bless people we bless people we know a lot of them don't have a clue about that but uh you know i'm always going to tell you the truth amen celebrate christmas yes give people gifts that have helped you throughout your life and maybe you've never said thank you it could be something simple you know i don't know the guy in the toll booth who has you know has to take your money all day long and go over the bridge we don't have those anymore in our city thank you god there was one person who ran for mayor nobody ever remembers anything about him but one thing he got rid of the toe booth that was his election promise and he actually kept it none of the rest of them so we remember him so i just want you to stay excited about this time and uh i have a few more minutes we're going to stop and take up an offering the holy spirit said don't miss letting them give so we're going to go ahead and take up the offering and uh to be a partner with us and what we do and i tell people what you're doing is you're helping to reveal heaven on this earth when you help uh partner with us and you give to us and you're blessing heaven at the same time because this is heaven's plan i did not sit in my room one day and come up with all this that was not on my list my list was i will be in big business one day and i will have a nice loft apartment somewhere and it will only be me father son and holy spirit with a wonderful life that was my plan i only got one part of that plan father son and holy spirit with me for the rest of my life [Laughter] they had their own plan and i was push whacked [Laughter] so and the other thing i'm gonna ask also is anybody who's watching this if you have not given to river rock church i would not be here sharing these words if he had not invited me that's right so even if he's met his expenses i would like for you to go to his site and give money to them they have a big project ahead of them they're going to help people with are you kidding is what my dad and all of us kids did for most of our lives we took food to people we took supplies to people we helped them move into homes we painted seniors homes we we have a heart to help so that's what i see with all this yeah and they didn't ask for it okay this is the thing they did not ask for this this was god's plan if you've given yourself to god expect the unexpected amen this is the unexpected but that is not normal for major companies to call you up and say i have traffic trainer loads of stuff to give to you do you want it i know people who beat dom the doors of those places say can you give some stuff to us to help with our project they didn't even say that they don't even have a place to put it and yet here it is and it's coming and it's not going to stop so they need a warehouse and not some cheap one that they have to spend half a million dollars fixing i want them to have a wonderful one amen amen so please give if you have not given and you're watching this you need to send some money to pastor eric at river rock church for this project amen and then you have a part of that reward no matter where it happens this is how god does he will give you reward like eric will get because you're helping him to do this he didn't ask me to do this god told me to do it he said you're going to bless my son eric you're going to bless riverrot who's invited you time and time again no matter how wild you are or the things that you say he obeys you obey i want to help him this is my plan it's his plan eric so you're not going to escape it so people please remember them but right now we're going to take up an offering uh for me to help me in what i do we have a lot of big plans weather warriors is gonna be one of them he's not gonna let us drop that and uh our whole women's thing we have will go worldwide the wonder women and now we're adding on top of that something for all the men called the dread champions because hell will drive you if anybody does anything it should be held dreading you amen you wake up in the morning they start getting terrified and so we have a lot of things we have our wonder woman event coming up we have our champions event coming up and next year we'll also add to that our host initiative event and our spirit realm boot camp which every member of the body of christ needs that so they know what the spirit realm is what happens there what authority do you have there how do you use that authority why is it necessary to know about in your life because the veil between the spirit realm and the natural realm is getting thinner we we really hope to see an angel one day one day they'll be everywhere and you will see them but there will be both sides and the other side will try to influence people too and you'll see them so why not know this is going to happen on this earth it's going to happen and so you're hearing this it's going to happen you will see angels you'll see them in your home living in your hands home going back to heaven and forth in your home they may have some come to the front door and knock and the other side will be happening they'll be trying to make friends with people and trying to prove that they're good too i'm talking about demons because so many of the kids games and videos and movies are actually helping to introduce them as something that is normal and so you have to have a voice that tells you this is going to happen it's important to know about this and people change when they have spirit around boot camp and they understand that's not just a mysterious unseen realm that is a real literal round where things travel in it there's highways in it there's places in it there's things that you need to know about that's where your real authority is when you speak and take authority your king or uh your king a priest or a lord in the spiritual level of authority so you have to know what that spiritual what that spirit realm is amen so make up checks to river rock church and then they'll just give me one check and i think you at the envelopes that are there in front of you somewhere i think you can give me your card if you want to and i will bless all of it in just a few minutes i i don't like to stop talking because i know i only have a little bit of time left here tonight because we also have what's tomorrow sunday so they have sunday morning and um and uh is my meeting sunday night 6 p.m and so so they got two meetings tomorrow they got their regular sunday morning meeting and then i will be back six o'clock tomorrow night here there's three meetings here that eric invited me to and then monday night um they're holding one here for the women's up for a glow international what used to be women's above the seventh of god they've changed it to a glow international so the men can come too and i've i've done a global international meetings and some people are surprised that the assembly god lets me speak but when i was growing up that was the denomination we went to we went there we were faithful we helped our our pastor and we're on part of his volunteer team and we love them they helped put a lot of god in us they put us on that right road that's where i got saved i was in the assembly god church my dad was a lay minister with them and my grandmother was a missionary so we do love that denomination and they're getting more and more of holy spirit in heaven they want the supernatural they want to know about heaven encounters and so monday night we will have another meeting here so i'm not done amen so please get ready to give your offering and uh we're going to let them take it up i'm not going to sing a song to you thank you would leave or you would cry i said well i've seen people cry not from the anointing not my gift all my kids were fussed in the back of the car i would sing and they would cry and they would repent and they would stop when they got older it would make me sing in the car with their friends when they were about 11 or 12. they wanted to make them laugh too maybe in heaven one day but on the earth that's not my gift and i don't dance either although i teach a dance to everybody we might do that tomorrow night the revelation dance it's like children you feel like children right there doing this and i'm wrong yes i saw it down in the phone i'm like well god said you're going to teach it and let me and then my daughters looked at me and went we don't have to help do we because i've been thrown out of jazzercise classes [Laughter] i was on like the step thing right little step thing you've never been there don't don't unless you know what you're doing and they do like step one two one two one one two two and they were like on step fifteen and i'm like one two or is it one one two and i looked up and everyone in the mirror was watching me and and i was like down front somewhere with my sister who dragged me in there not down john didn't drag me there and the instructor stopped saying okay you back there you yeah you you are going to go to the back of the room in the corner because you can't keep up and everyone is trying to do except now they're watching you so would you go back there please that didn't hurt my feelings i told my sister this is not going to work so i'm in the in the back in the corner i'm still doing the same thing you know is this one two one one two because i have not gifted in that either and again the music was rocking and people were doing nothing because then they were trying to look behind everybody in the mirror to see what i was doing so i was asked to leave and i was like yes amen i believe now that was pretty much the same thing that happened to me in eighth grade when i tried out for chorus i wasn't always bold you know i would go for it anyway and they so they had the auditions you know how that happens they let anybody anybody who wants you to be in the course just come audition so we know where to place you and i went and they were singing that dough ready me thing and i'm halfway through and the people are laughing so hard they're crying i'm saying the director was crying the people there to audition were crying and go stop this is the joke isn't it and what yes it is that was not written on my scroll but by speaking wildly and boldly about what god wants regardless of what people think about you to not care when people bash me or whatever they try to do um i don't know they make yourself a target on uh facebook or youtube or twitter and whatever that new thing is we're gonna be doing instagram instagram and we're already doing podcasts we're going to be doing webinars guys it'll put you out a lot more online and i just ignore everybody out there i do not have time to stop and justify myself and uh i don't have time it's wasting time i just start with you know i love you but you're banned [Laughter] we got a lot of banding done during the election i mean like a lot of people those three nights when god said i'm going to tell you all the characteristics and the qualities of this person i have chosen for president and everybody was trying to guess who that was and and our viewing audience went from like it went from like you know 20 30 000 to 200 000 overnight and then 800 000 because and so on that fourth day when i had when god revealed who it was i have not chosen a pastor for your president i have not chosen an apostle or i mean i went through the whole five whole thing i haven't chosen any of those because you don't need them i have chosen a businessman and this name is donald j and it was like bash back like we were up all night long you know trying to get all the bachelors off of here and i think that what really very quite really a whole lot was a very small percentage but the rest of them were celebrating celebrating celebrating and then they went to the voting booth and they voted amen so it was worth it and this is god saying this to me this is the father he said i'm gonna throw you so far out there you are never coming back i'm putting you on a political platform a lot of people aren't going to like what you say but i like it so i'm just letting you know your life is going to be over completely because i'm following you out there and i'm not bringing you back off that political platform and trump's winning and i don't care what anyone says because i'm voting this time and i'm turning that map red so whether they like it or not this is going to happen and you're going to let them all know and i said amen and i had pastors calling me saying are you sure you want to say that you you are you know you're risking your entire reputation now i thought we weren't supposed to have one amen is that not true so this is not my reputation that i'm ruining at all no i don't have a reputation i don't even have an opinion i'm just going to say what god wants and a lot of times that's never popular so why should it be any different amen amen people can fight and kick all they want to you will watch trump re-elected in 2020 and then you will see pence elected and then can three elect him and i don't know who he's gonna pick but god's still talking to me about that person whoever pence picks for his vice president and he will seriously consider that he's a very strong believer seriously whoever he picks is going to win yes because pence will win that term and then they will be president also this other person for eight years 24 years of god in our white house there will be so many major chips you know into into what god wants in this country and god has told me that doesn't mean that that i won't let other people still win he said at one point it will be a moderate there will be a moderate person elected uh this is after pence's vice president and after all that he said but even still that i'm so rad if we change america people will come here to find god they'll come to find me amen they'll get the american dream some of them but that won't be their focus the folks will become to find me amen so you can celebrate your lives and your children your grandchildren your great grandchildren will live in a whole different time that we didn't live in amen and i'm 66 i'm still young god calls me a baby you know uh america is a baby he says america is a baby amen yes we're only a couple hundred years old yes when you put us up to england and these other countries and see how long they've been around that israel you know china how long have they been here we are a baby and saint wants to destroy the baby he's always afraid of the baby he always has been well we're a baby but we're going to grow up amen we're going up strong and happy and filled with god and uh there'll still be things arise in our country but they'll be dealt with swiftly there will be no anarchy in the streets in our country that we know is trying to overthrow each other in our country which has always been one of the devil's plans and he doesn't know what he's messing with and this is what god said when they kept trying to say there's going to be you know anarchy in the streets and then the international guard will be called and take control of everything and there's half a million body bags waiting in uh in missouri for the bodies what happened from all this war in the streets and god's like laughing in heaven he said that's not my plan and that is not going to happen he said besides the fact that they don't understand that they aren't ever going to get their weapons god said they won't ever get their guns in america there's too many he rednecks that there's too many rednecks in america they all got guns they're not giving any of them up but they will use them so they can forget about getting their guns because it is our right to protect ourselves in other countries that are like third world countries that happened because they took away the right to bear arms they have no voice in their country they have no way to protect themselves in their country that's why they're crushed down and god said leaders who are presidents can be great leaders in the way if they want good for their country and if they want to do what is right for the country then their country can be great he said but dictators if you're a dictator then you hate what is right most of the time you only want what you want it has to be only your way and you crush if you don't get your way you take away all the rights of the people that way they can be controlled they can only operate oh it sounds like the market of east and then they can only operate the way you allow them to operate he said but america is not that country amen and i will pray for all of us stand up and pray for those other countries right now that are going through shifts in their government that they will hear god and they will do what is right amen amen so we say we can all repeat this god our father jesus christ our king our king holy spirit our best friend we stand in the gap for all those countries that don't have justice liberty or freedom we pray on their behalf that you will help them open the eyes of their leaders to see what is right and to go after what is right we pray those people be loved and cared for they will have no more wars or poverty or disease in their countries we pray that you will bless them and if necessary remove the wicked leaders because when the righteous rules the people rejoice that we declare over those countries we thank you for putting us in america we thank you for blessing america and we say god bless this world you made it with your hands you love this earth help us to love more and care more for others and let it be honored as it is in heaven amen [Music] amen and so father i just blessed all the people who came tonight ask you to bless them when they rise up and when they lie down let them have visions let them have dreams father let them have encounters in heaven let them visibly see their destiny to know why you sent them to know you more to receive revelation and i pray that their souls will prosper father and they will prosper and live in divine health and have declare over each one of them increase in every way for their giving tonight

welcome everybody here we are catker on studio oq one haven't you ever wondered in these days it would be great if we just knew the truth because let me tell you there's crazy wild things going on out there see look i dress professional does that help people to believe because actually you know god's revelations are for those who will receive them not for those who bash them so today you will hear god's reality and jen is pointing her finger at me oh hi i'm looking in the wrong place see we flipped our ipad because you know our our professional crew they're not here today it's just jen and i you know why we love you and never forget we love you if everything went down for a while i hope you would be careful about how much cake you're eating [Laughter] we will be addressing that before we're done tonight you now this is going to be a short broadcast number one my husband's waiting to eat and i've learned from men if the world's falling apart which it's not if they're at war in a bunker where the missile is flying past them that probably doesn't happen that way however i will tell you this men have to eat all you women who are married say amen because i have been married for 43 years and this is not about my marriage but why not bring it into play i have learned how to get along with my husband and love him not want to run him out of town on a rail some of you if you're in your 10th 12th year of marriage you may feel that way please hang in there okay god brought you that man and you know what i will address this another guy the holy spirit said continue on with what you have to say and they have asked me to talk about god's reality which is actually the thing we should want to know the most and actually his reality is the truth a lot of fake news going on everybody you've known that for months probably years but right now with the stuff going on right now in washington dc and everything else there's a lot of stuff being flown out there for you to listen to or you to watch i hope you find some truth in some of it some of it's like so far out there is from outer space some of us just on wi-fi space some of it i'm not quite sure where it's from i just know one thing i listen to god i hear him well i have known him for some time now which is his decision to put me out there i was always the person that wanted to hide because i didn't need anybody uh personally i had a try therefore i had all the validation or war that i wanted so right now i can persevere and continue on i forgive everyone out there please do not waste your time trying to explain to people who don't want to hear an explanation or who don't want the truth just pray for them and ignore them like they said nothing whatsoever because that's actually the best thing you can do and i know because more people are watching and listening you're always going to get more of the side that is clueless who hates everybody who has their own mindset and doesn't want anyone else's who are just angry and they want to vent on everybody right now i happen to be a bull's-eye but i'm also a bull's-eye for god that part i love so i forgive everybody in advance god act like they never said it especially if it was one of your prophets jumping off the path off the train or out into nowhere please forgive them and help them to know the truth so they can be free they can be powerful for you and not a voice for the enemy because right now the reality god's reality is this is not a doom and gloom time this is not a time to be in fear to tolerate fear or participate with fear it's a time to be great with god excited about his plans and please pursue making plans for your life like you were before all this ever happened because it will be like it never happened and that is god's reality he has a moment in time to shift us and accelerate us forward but before he does that he will cleanse the platform expose the darkness and boy is there a lot of that to expose and it doesn't matter what group it's being disposed from it will be exposed in this time and god will also deal with it in this time why because of all the powerful things he has planned for us i have been there i have seen it it is going to be great your children's future is so fantastic it will not be filled with fear it will not be filled with evil it will not be filled with having to run and escape somewhere hide under your school desk you know that's not what's happening right now it's god asking us to trust him until his time comes to show it all and trust me you wonder what time is going to happen you will see it you'll see the exposure you'll see the arrest you'll see the fraud he will not let anyone escape with justice not being brought to them justice will be served that's what he says so wait for the justice people is so worth it to love your family spend time with them go on as normal as you possibly can until it's wiped out disposed of put away wiped off and god will set in place the ones he trusts to speak to you now we have several things we want to talk about in this broadcast so i'll just give you a little what is it called an outline an index whatever you want to call it okay we will discuss the reality of what god is doing right now we will discuss the earthquakes that started the shaking that god said on november the 4th of 2020 when the ground begins to shake wait for the great exposure of fraud to begin to happen and when it's done it will all be dealt with it will all be brought to justice i don't need to name any names to let you know that this is what he's doing so on november the 4th things started shaking and guess what even up to right now they are still shaking not just here in america all over the world some of them cannot even be explained why because sometimes in the spirit realm what they're doing is so powerful there's always a little bit of that that laps over into this natural realm and people can feel it sometimes they can hear it and let me tell you that shaking and the winds being released that is god moving on this earth yes i mean the father moving on the earth you remember what happened the first time he did that the mountains caught on fire well he wants your souls to catch on fire for him not in fear not thinking you needed to be rescued this is god's reality now we've jumped to that subject god has a reality and his reality is this is a powerful exciting time to be alive he has never changed that some people have changed it some people are jumping off that train right now thinking that we're going to be derailed and there'll be a crash i think the future will take a crash because you cannot speak for god saying adamantly this is what he has said and this is what he's going to do and just because you don't know the time you think it's not gonna happen that is an immaturity in the prophets of god you need to know if he says something to you or showed you and said this will happen just because it's not a year window of time or man's window of time it doesn't mean it won't happen you can't back up you can't stop going forward the true prophets of god right now are speaking greatness the power of god the joy of the lord celebration celebration celebration is coming to america that's what his true prophets are saying if you hear them saying there's doom and gloom let's go we're going into the deep darkness guess who they're listening to not god the enemy has a voice too and when you accept fear he'll make sure satan well make sure you hear his voice and then you'll believe it and then you run after it and then you repeat it does this sound like a cycle i can tell you right now god wants you to believe him and trust him satan does not hold your life in his hand that doesn't happen to the very end and you most likely won't be here unless you're several hundred years old you are in the greatest days god designed to be on the earth he's just setting it up i'm sorry it didn't happen on the third i'm sorry it didn't happen so far in january that doesn't mean he's not doing it no because i do have something a lot don't i has a seer anointing if you were a prophet and you could see into the spirit you would right now see demons quaking in fear sliming their way to get out of the way because they know and they can see god is walking across this nation they're terrified now because they know their plans are going up in smoke literally they're running away as fast as they can so they don't get burnt by the fire of god and let me tell you your prayers are so powerful when you stand with god and you make declarations it begins to release something in the spirit realm that does cause fear and the camp of the enemy the enemy is not man the enemy is satan he just uses man he uses him for his own purposes to speak his words to say what his plans are his plans are never good and they don't bring hope or joy to anybody so don't listen to anyone who's speaking in doom and gloom and hate and cowering and having to put up with a horrible future maybe they want that future i don't the moral majority in this country don't want that future the true body of christ who are all knowing that god is going to move his hand when he is ready whether it is tomorrow or not you may hold your finger out and say you're fake news you're a fake leader we don't receive you we don't celebrate what you've said because fraud has been committed not sure that facebook will let me keep this one up make sure you're taping it make sure you make a copy of it and keep it all right and i'm telling you anything you want to keep that's been said and spoken or written make a paper copy go find your printer if you didn't forget what that was print it so you may hold it in the time i had should you for a few weeks need to do that if not i hope you're taking notes because i will tell you this everything god has spoken that god himself has spoken it will happen and it will be great and there will be celebration in the streets so the reality of god is make your stand and don't be moved and while you're waiting celebrate why does god say celebrate that shows the enemy and your friends that you're standing in faith your faith isn't going to be stolen from you it will be accelerated and guess what all your friends and family that made fun of you will remember the words you said to them and when what god's going to do happens they will be running to you for answers that is the reality of right now this whole week accelerate your faith trust god and let him hear you say that let's say it together father in heaven father in heaven i choose with my will i choose with my will to choose your promises to choose your promise and your plan and your plan over man's over for the enemies or the enemies i am your child i am your child i will serve no more than god i will serve no other you except you your son jesus christ your son jesus and the holy spirit and holy spirit you made everything you made everything you know everything you know everything you have great thoughts for me you have great thoughts for me and great plans for me and great plans those plans those plans i will receive i will receive and i will run after them and i will run after them everything everything is about to change it's about to change jesus name in jesus name amen amen there you go you said it with your own mouth don't step back from those words they are powerful teach your children to celebrate what jesus christ did for them and what his plans are for right now on this earth this is not a joke this is not a recording i'm live see here i'll pinch myself this is a real life this is god's reality all the rest of it is a smoke screen by satan wanting to try to convince us that we're going down life is going down the country's going down that's awfully funny i remember the last time god showed up when satan thought he won he got burnt i can expect to see the same i've seen demons slinking away from everything running from dc as fast as they can you know what that means if the enemy's power is left great confusion will begin to fall on the others get ready for a real show that's all i can say remember whose life you are in their hands right that life is yours the decision is yours the word should be yours that you agree with life and not death god says to choose life and to speak life whatever is a good report sir remind you of the word those words you declare so if you hear things that aren't a good report we know where that came from no matter who is saying them pray for those people do not bash those people man if they ever needed help it would be right now i don't care how major a prophet it is who all of a sudden overnight has decided the bad stuff is going to happen because guess what they're looking with their natural eyes and when god says they begin to do that this is what they see they can see as far as their hand and that's it but when you stay focused on god keep your eyes on him stay excited don't step back on the word and you will be accelerated and you will be prospered and you will be blessed and you will have the greatest memories that you can tell your children and your grandchildren you will not believe what happened in this beginning of this divine decade boy we had to make a stand so remember to celebrate and i will show you the cake in just a minute jen is waving me down keep us on track jen whatever whatever are we supposed to talk about um well you wanted to mention the earthquakes yes november the 4th was when god actually began to talk about what would happen and i can go back on the elijah list and re-share the november 4th uh facebook live with you and steve yeah so everyone can hear when you said that oh yeah that actual uh broadcast was so powerful and really neither one of us probably knew what god would say he just knew he wanted to speak after november the 3rd which of course we know was election day god knew exactly what would happen so it is very powerful that god since november the 4th what he said would happen has been happening you just haven't seen and heard it but trust me you will but on november the 4th that day when he said when the ground begins to shake look for the beginning of the landslide a fraud what happened on november the 4th john well there was a earthquake in yosemite valley california there you go that's the usa and um the thing that we thought was also amazing was the day of the election yes because remember they they they stopped counting they stopped counting at midnight or 1am something like that and then there was a earthquake around 2 58 i'm trying to remember where it was in the morning yeah in the morning that would have been eight pm that would have been the fourth probably when stuff was going earthquake i think it was was it alaska falls pass alaska of all names false past alaska are you kidding is that crazy i think god was saying something yeah and then of course we all know they mysteriously got all those votes that came in at 3am yes hey that's just a few minutes after 2 52 a.m not only that there was a second earthquake in alaska at 5 35 p.m so all those hours going by we're going to find out about all that really soon but where else in the world on november 4th were the earthquakes there was one in canada there was the philippines greece turkey actually many one yeah there was a lot have they stopped since then no not at all but not just the earthquakes there's been mysteriously mysterious ground shakings everywhere that's not reported that's right they don't know where it's come from and also there's been activities a host of heaven people unusual gust of winds that have come out of nowhere yes that were not natural right they weren't like a natural wind i'm telling you god why would god say that about the shaking it's to encourage you and let you know he is doing things that you cannot see right now but everything that is seen this is what the word says everything this scene was made by that which was unseen the unseen is the spirit realm it is a father son and holy spirit's activities and there is a lot of that going on they are driving things out moving things into position that they will need their place there for what is going to happen this week will be key i'm not saying tomorrow i'm not promising anything tomorrow except god won't stop moving and doing things until all of this is shown and you will see it with your natural eyes and hear it with your ears and then there'll be the great celebration your job is to stay in faith stand and stand therefore but don't stand looking sorry and sad and fearful remember please to pray for all those who are backing up apologizing for things they said there's nothing to apologize for people the truth will be made known and no one will escape knowing about it no one will escape being uncovered that did it so pray for those who've jumped off the train and backed up and god pray that they be reached that they know the truth and tell the truth to not get people to fear don't let people put fear in you then the enemy has something in you he can use it won't stop god from what he's going to do but why not enjoy every day of your life let god says you choose to be happy if no one else does heaven is happy heaven is excited we thought we would drink bring these up because we've had a lot of questions the last broadcast we did has already reached a hundred and forty two thousand people what they want to hear somebody who's hearing god and gives them hope god always brings hope so are you saying that even if a certain someone is sworn in on the 20th yes i think and we all wake up on the 21st yes and he still thinks he's in that position it means we should still stand strong stand strong and know this until it's all revealed it isn't over that's right god has the final say and when he says it and when it is all done somebody will be moving back in the white house and guess what they know it too there's no fear in the lives of those who just moved out they already know that they will be back so just remember covert activities hey guys just be thankful god didn't ask us to wait 120 years like he did with noah he's just wanting us to wait a little while so keep holding on it's gonna happen the rain is coming he keeps telling me the rain is coming the rain is the evidence but this time it's the enemy's camp that's going to be flooded and destroyed that's right and we are not for violence of any kind well maybe spiritual violence did you know there's a godly violence a spiritual violence that you wore in the spirit against satan against the demonic armies that is certainly okay we don't want to have violence against people although the group that says they don't want it seem to be doing it you already know what i'm talking about right god didn't intend us to have to put up or tolerate violence not in this country not in our lives actually not for those who believe him in this day you won't have to die to show who god is but you will have to live and live powerfully and rule and reign with christ in this world right now and he is not afraid was there anything else we were going to talk about jenna oh yes the holy spirit just reminded me guess what i still have lights on outside if at all possible go put some lights back up maybe you haven't taken them down the light represents god so let's leave some light up until the real inauguration happens maybe leave up the red lights red and white lights very white would be great that would be great but if you only got white we'll take that we're leaving ours up i hope you leave yours up i hope they're seeing everywhere and people go blows up we have hope for a future we are trusting our god our god is light why not put something up outside or in your window that represents god that's who our savior is that's someone who loves us that's the one who made you even the other side who's very confused right now i know jen wants to hurry so she can have cake yes by the way we will now discuss the cake when i said eat cake i didn't mean eat a whole cake i know some of you are taking advantage of that i know i have seen the comments okay when this is over you may have to have a flash weight loss program we will help you with that too right now just eat a little piece so here's my cake to explain this is a piece of cake but i will be eating this part of it you see the little piece cut out right there you may have

that i do i do it for you to enjoy to know more to be more to run your race powerfully in this time to crush the darkness and i do want to also mention besides the connection between youtube and

it's not normal okay now you can check out the intro and you can check out the new intro right now we've actually created an intro for on the go with cat so when you see that you're going to know this is going to be something exciting or fun or interesting and so if you're watching [Music] so anyway that was awesome wasn't it anyway i love doing things where i can connect with people you know i come from a really big family for those who don't know me at all guess what what about the pink hair i am going to answer that question we recently had a question from somebody why do you have the pink hair so there's some people who've known why for like 15 years right i've had this pink hair for a very long time it's because god asked me to have this pink hair why heaven is different it is fantastic it is amazing and i represent heaven wherever i go and he wanted me to show it on the outside so how about that heaven's exciting and because he asked me to do it i obeyed i think god would appreciate it when we listen we hear and we obey that is what he loves so this is just really obedience of course i was not a pink care person that would make it too easy for me but i have gotten used to it and i want to bless the heart of god and so guess what yes i get it done every four weeks god didn't put this pink hair on my head i actually have to pay for it so again guardians own people thank you so much for supporting me we have many things planned for the future it's going to be really exciting around here and a lot of action going on not just here in our studio but around this world don't take your eyes off of korea god is still doing something with that also hollywood i am involved now in helping to create a spirit realm input for the resurrection of jesus christ movie and by the way i just need to give a tip it's not the one with mel gibson we bless mel gibson and pray for him continually he gave us a passion was that not amazing but this one is being done through a different whole group you go to the resurrection of jesus christ website you'll probably see me talking on that website and find out some more information they'll be putting a lot more on there we're working really hard i do sketches of the spirit realm of heaven of hell because i've been to those places and then my prophetic artist makes them amazing and these are scenes and images and beings that will actually be in that movie so god notified me that i would be involved in this several years ago so i was preparing myself all along to be a part but it's absolutely amazing that we will get to change the way people think about jesus christ about heaven about how the reality of both of those places and also what really happened in the spirit realm in the garden on the cross in hell on the third day when christ wasted the principalities and powers and took the keys of hell death and the grave you'll be seeing on the big screen in a few years it's it's a it's a big project but i'm going to enjoy being a part of it we do a lot of on the on the go with cat you see a lot of those things happening and i give you tips about what goes on with the making of a movie and so i'm looking forward to being a part of that also don't take your eyes off of london especially concerning the royalty boy there's stuff going on right now isn't there we're gonna hear about that from here too uh i'm sure that i have we'll have a lot more to share later but uh we love queen elizabeth we pray for her we pray for that whole country you know we america was kind of birthed out of that country i do know in the habitation of god coming to this earth that america and england will be doing things hand in hand for that move of god in this earth so don't take your eyes off of there either there's a lot of other things going on in this world i know there's violence in some areas there's disasters in some areas we're learning to take authority over all that because as a believer that is your right to rule and reign with christ to have authority over the weather because we're over it not under it we also host weather warriors here we host um the the host initiative which is the army of heaven working with us we also of course i already mentioned drug champions and wonder women we have a lot going on god has put on our plate and we're going to be doing great with all those things don't take your eyes off of trump now that's hard to do right because you know this broadcast couldn't go by without me mentioning trump who will win in 2020 look forward to celebrating with him i already am i'm sure that i'll be at the um inaugural prayer breakfast in washington dc uh last time i actually got to pray for not in person but i did pray for the president for pence and at that time it was awesome i will be doing a capitol hill broadcast sometime this year i'll let you know in advance if you're in washington dc at that time stop by the capitol outside and say hi to us i'll make sure you get those days it's going to be amazing god will be exposing darkness but i'm telling you he chose trump and he has not done with him yet i look forward to all that god is going to do through him through his administration and you know don't worry about the fake news okay don't worry about him on you are fake news okay you fake your fake news yes and guess what even heaven goes about that heaven's talking about all the stuff going on on the earth it's not like they're blinded from it they understand what's going on everybody's declaring and decreeing for things on this earth god cares about you he hasn't forgotten about you no matter who you are he loves you he sent his son to die for you and something new that god gave us assignment on was to put out a 20 20 calendar excuse me let me take a little drink from my i don't do demons cup there you go this is something that he had us actually i know it's probably already on there but you know i'm a hands-on person so here we go i'm not going to show you a lot about it he actually commissioned us to do a calendar on heaven itself and is called the world called heaven we still have some left if you haven't gotten yours go to revealingheaven.com click on the store and get your calendar every month there's an image of a place that actually exists in heaven it also talks about that place that i saw in heaven and in during the month the dates of that month we've added some special days that we've included about celebrating heaven or life we have two interactive months in this calendar where you actually send pictures of something to us and we're gonna have a lot of fun with that but this is a powerful calendar you're gonna know so much about heaven it makes a great gift for somebody no matter what time of year you give it to somebody it'll be something they'll probably keep for a very long time so i hope you'll check out uh our store make sure you check out the calendar a world called heaven last year we did one on the host of heaven and for the first time god really is revealing heaven in images on this earth because we work for god and this is heavens one of heaven's bases on the earth one quest international with one purpose from one god that is to reveal and create heaven on this earth i hope you will check us out again i look forward to talking to you again i'm just going to mention anything else jen on the calendar we have fun days like you were saying and the fun day for this month is um download from the idea zone day oh download from the idea zones that day that gives me another subject to talk about what does that mean there is an idea zone in heaven literally over the streets of gold there's this beautiful cloud that's got all these like thousands and thousands of pieces it looks like little pieces of glitter every one of those is a witty idea an invention and god sends waves of that idea zone down to the earth and drops them into the mind of man that's how we get all those amazing ideas and so we have that date put on the calendar in february make sure if you already have a 2020 calendar you check that date out that would be february the 4th no the third 25th the 25th see you can tell i've really studied this i'm going to have to really check it out a little bit more [Laughter] so anyway um i still are you are you done y'all need to not be pointing at things okay your crew y'all just need to know this is new we have new equipment new lights i'm excited about this so i'm learning right along with you okay is there anything else i need to be saying anything that god wants or anything he wants to say okay well i can tell you right now god's excited about this time he calls it the divine decade the next 10 years are going to be so powerful and so focused by god from heaven about things that will happen you will be amazed if you don't belong to god if you receive jesus christ make sure you do that the most important thing you do in your life is to make sure your name is written in the lamest book of life because you won't like the other option okay been the hell been there seeing that nobody wants to go there but heaven itself is an amazing place filled with fun with excitement with adventure and let me tell you when people go there to live don't cry for them we have friends we have family up there i celebrate with them all the time what a beautiful amazing place you live in the life of god itself so many things to do in heaven people get to see each other again you live near your family members i hope that's going to be okay with you and how about this one you get your pets in heaven only they won't be normal either there's not much that's normal about heaven everything is given to you for free all right you breathe in the life of god all the time you travel on light you travel unsound even your very worship you travel in heaven fantastic amazing places i think i'm going to have to have a special segment every now and then that is nothing but about having people really want to know what is it like and i tell people all the time instead of a funeral home they need to have party depots and that's where you sent from here to go live in heaven in your spiritual body your physical body will be resting that's what sleeps because people say what about the dead in christ when they rise that is your body your body is sleeping but your spirit man is very much alive in heaven eating the best food that ever existed with no weight gain or food allergies i'm sure someone's going to love the fact that i said that and i want to say hi to all my friends that i have met over the years i i do know quite a few people now either from facebook or just from traveling to many places here in america and even overseas and you know what i'm just going to mention this god does have plans for germany also i've been to stuttgart several times the people are wonderful they're precious people that lived there none of them wanted hitler by the way he is in hell that's just free for all of you out there whoever wondered no he didn't make it to heaven there was no place made for him he never had a mansion being built he didn't want anything but evil and uh whether you like this broadcast or not this is my time and god's time and we said he could say what he wanted to i want you know he's hanging on to me hook and hell there now you got a real visual right uh but let me tell you there is a place of torture for the wicked for the evil for those who hate god who who hate people you are going to go nowhere you have no future whatsoever satan will not give you anything except hate and so i just want to let you know that for free germany the people in germany are wonderful god created them to carry the glory and you know who thought he would steal it and use that country for his own purposes at which he did but those people are kind they're wonderful i want to say hi to all my friends and stu ca stinker i hope to see you again soon and i'm blessed about your brand new building you've gotten built god is really gonna prosper people who've been faithful for so long in this time and they'll be doing things around this world not just in your city or in your state you have to see beyond your own capabilities people you were made by god he has great plans for you don't let fear interfere don't cry and whine that the devil's been beating you up run him off crush the darkness push it back jesus christ said to all those who follow him i give you power over all the power of the enemy so why don't you use it speak

or https://youtu.be/SXlG7gReb4Q
and being so happy i hope you are by the way i just want to start by saying i have talked to several my prophet friends just to make sure they're celebrating and guess what they are they have an all jumped ship hope you haven't jumped ship if you have we'll throw you a life raft anyway i had to of course come on i'm gonna come on every other day as long as we're still up i'll still be speaking and guess what i'm running forward with my race running forward with life with joy with celebration and with god in his plans and yes according to the title of this post the shaking has begun and i'm serious about that i'll tell you why i'm excited you should go back and look at on the largest streams the broadcast we did on november the 4th and what god himself had to say about all of this guess what he didn't give a date and i'm not giving a date i actually never have given a date i let god choose his time because man has their own time frame some people can wait a few days some a couple weeks but man i don't think anybody can go past a month except the ones who really know what god said and i can tell you what god's doing yes there is a line being drawn who will believe him and stand with him and who he can use and accelerate in these powerful days ahead and who will have to catch up so i hope you're not on the ketchup side that could mean several things i won't go there however i do want to tell everyone hello all you people who are still standing with what god said i celebrate you i congratulate you you have blessed the heart of god that you're not giving up your stand we all know what the bible says when you make a stand stand therefore you also know what it says right when you're going forward in the kingdom don't stab back or what you will not be fit in shape or ready for the kingdom so there you go that's god's words to you i hope you all who switched and jumped to the side of darkness and that's all there is is darkness and light right now get out of there while you can and be one of the ones who made a stand that you can celebrate and run in the streets and shout and yell that's exactly what's going to happen because life will win god always says to choose life stand with life participate with life not the other side you remember we prayed for mark zuckerberg right so he knows he still has a chance to switch back and do what he did when he started all this he just he designed and made a wonderful place for all of us to come and fellowship together get to see different pictures and videos and laugh and enjoy them and enjoy life and something happened to him please be praying for him okay this is a great place to do social networking and that's why it was designed but you can't let them ban you because you want god or you want what is right or you want life and so in them who don't even know what they're saying you don't realize what you're saying when you don't want to be on the other side and not decide god has chosen if you think he's run away and he's hiding somewhere in heaven that is not true did you feel the groan shake yet because you will you remember on november 4th god himself said when the ground begins to shake get ready for the landslide to expose everything and you know what god's plans are you've heard me say it from the very beginning from 2015 guess what he's not changed his plan what he is do is exposing all the darkness he's going to clean that platform off no matter where they are what they're saying what they're doing god's preparing us for the next 20 years of greatness no you don't have to get used to wearing masks for the rest of your life you don't have to social distance for the rest of your life god intends to actually take the virus off the earth maybe he'll put it with the other ones who were running away i don't know i just know this i know what god's plans are he hasn't changed them and unless he tells me differently i am not changing my stand i will be right here releasing justice releasing the host of heaven and by the way yesterday released 50 billion of the host of heaven and if you did not know this god calls florida over the skies of florida he calls it his battle station on earth what does that mean that means their billions of the hosts posted there to be sent out on assignment and he had me send 50 billion yes people he has a lot no one knows but him you haven't counted them you probably haven't even seen them you'd probably be hiding if you had the host of heaven are not beautiful pretty boys with blonde hair and harps they have weapons coming out of them the frequency of god the fire of god they fight with lightning bolts and guess what some of the ones who've been assigned now are the same ones who fought in the flesh on behalf of israel go back and read it in the bible how one angel took up so many hundreds of thousands that shocked them all we have some of those fighting with us i enjoy commanding the host of heaven and they enjoy going on assignments they need orders from headquarters and let me tell you headquarters in heaven is very excited about these days i know you've heard several times different people sending things around i'm sure some of it's conspiracy stuff some of it's just being made up to make you feel better some of it's actually the real thing you should decide on what you think it is i just say this get plenty of supplies including cake and maybe for a couple weeks or so just to save you a trip to the grocery store this is not a time for death and destruction for us this is not a time for civil war in a civil war you have to have a divided nation we have a pocket of people who'd rather have communism here i said it the rest of us almost 80 million of us that's the majority in case you can't count we want life liberty freedom justice and righteousness in this nation and we are going to get it if god can save a world when eight people are praying how much do you think he can do with millions of people praying for this nation for its destiny and also the impact that will have around this world there are millions and millions of people praying and agreeing with you what you shouldn't do is begin to bash one another you're speaking the enemy's words i'll bash evil all day long then i'm gonna bash the ones he made god sends people to this earth they're already anointed they're already appointed i happen to be just one of those but i will not lose my stand and i will not back up because these are powerful days if people say what's going on their powerful days and when the hand of you god is about to move for you yes you can sit and eat cake and watch you've prayed you've read your word you've laid on your face you've cried out to god guess what he heard you he's not going to ignore your words when they line up with his when your words line up with his they create something that no man and no devil can stop so this is what we have to say go host make toast i can tell you that they were released 50 billion the other day today 10 more billion god had me release two key points in this country and key points around the world to be ready what can they do they can expose things they can speak to people and change the way that they're thinking they can say things of god to their spirit just like the devil says to yours if you're hearing it's all over let's just give it up you're hearing the wrong voice the shaking has surely begun that god spoke up on november the 4th when he said when the ground begins to shake get ready for the great exposure the landslide of exposure that will happen he's not changing who he has chosen to keep in the white house and it doesn't matter to me when god finishes what he's going to start i am celebrating with him he took me forward in time again today and showed me people running into the streets in america laughing they forgot if they didn't like someone of another color nobody cared they were so happy and joyful they were grabbing they were hugging each other without masks people nobody cared because freedom and liberty had come to this country and then he took me and showed me different places around the world when this landslide is done they were running into the streets they were grabbing one another laughing they were dancing they were celebrating that is your future so don't give up don't step back and don't take any fear the only ones who should be afraid are the ones who committed crime i'll tell you who is afraid hell i've seen demons quaking everywhere they're terrified of what is about to happen they know what's going on they know the hosts have been loosed on this earth they know what they've even been assigned to they're running so why not sit down get your popcorn and enjoy the show because it's going to be great people one day will make a movie of all this and people will roar and laugh and clap at the end that's what you should be doing and jen has a report to give a very short report about what god said on november the 4th when the ground begins to shake get ready for the landslide to happen so she's going to come and share with you all just a couple of earthquakes that have taken place uh over the over the last couple days and especially the one that happened on the fourth there you go john come here i'll just stand over here okay go ahead and say it loud then so um there were quite a lot of things that happened especially on the fourth i pulled up an article and i'm trying to find it yeah it's the world earthquake report for monday january 4th 2021 and it said that there were 10. 24th of november january 14th january the 4th okay yeah and it says um 10 of the largest earthquakes in the world happened and it just lists all the different ones and then the ones that were felt were places like croatia and um let's see there was a couple in croatia there was one in south dakota there was new zealand and puerto rico and if you just go and just you can literally see every day from from on this website including and then when she was talking about when she sent the host out um yesterday how many did you send out 50 billion 50 billion you'd hear that well it it's crazy because i pulled up an article this morning when i opened up the internet and it the first thing it said was south florida residents report shaking no official reports of earthquake or explosions and it happened in areas like ballard county miami-dade monroe counties also in um coral i think it's coral coral springs and just various people were reporting that their house started shaking this dad was working with his son doing virtual school when their chairs started to shake and then um the rest of the family came running the room asking what was that because he thought am i imagining this they went outside to see if it was like a big truck there was no big truck they've checked all the size were seismographs the um geographical whatever people that check for for earthquakes they there's no reports nothing none of the graphs moves none of the things and then they said well maybe because there's a lot of military that maybe they were testing the jets because when they they do the sonic boom but they they so they contacted the military bases in the area and they said no we did all our jet testing on thursday nothing was done on friday so at the very end of the article it says the official cause of the shaking and rumbling is not yet known yeah because you can't see the host leave so but you can sure hear them so i did share the article in the link but um there has been a tremendous amount of activity like i even uh googled earthquake um january 12th there was a magnitude 2.9 earthquake in utah um and then that does not mean god will destroy with earthquakes that's letting you know something is happening yeah and if you even do earthquakes for today you just google earthquakes for today it literally shows you a list of all of the ones that happened today uh do they have one here today um in the u.s um let's see i think it was indonesia earthquakes today here we go uh there was uh 5.5 in iran a 5.5 in afghanistan i understand that completely a 5.9 in guatemala a 4.0 in hawaii and this one really when i told you this one there was a 3.6 in conrad california which is smack in the middle between sacramento and san francisco wow and what did you say about san francisco yeah they just put a notice out that they were banning trump from any kind of broadcast or saying anything whatsoever from san francisco in their area in their frequencies and that's exactly where that earthquake happened i think god is saying he's not happy about that so this is just a little heads up to encourage you to let you know that shaking has definitely begun and no one can turn that back nobody can turn back time nobody can stop god from what he wants to do i just want to encourage you all really seriously keep celebration in your heart again god spoke to me and he said don't get off the path i put you on keep encouraging them to celebrate like freedom has already come because it will so we want to remind you whether they're still up tomorrow or not whether anything is taken down i'm talking about the actual social media is taken down as the networks are taken down if all that is taken down you have to remember this god has not changed his mind and do not let fear interfere in your life i'm not going to and i will still be here when it's all done i do need to let you know that i've become so popular with the criminals and criminal activity that they have another fake cat curb it's called decatur facebook page and again they're using the same plot they're trying to trap people into joining and signing up to win a thousand dollars that is not me yes i know that's my face they swiped one of my videos off of my page and used it to prove to you that that was really me i'm letting you know it's not me it is not me i think it's like it's got v then it's got like um a hyphen and then it has cat cur on there it has my picture if you see me in my studio sitting next to my uh portrait of the peacock and that's the picture they've used that's a fake one go on there and tell them i'm not falling for it you're a fake you know let them know that you're not happy about that whatever you do do not sign up to receive anything there is no money they want to steal your personal identification i do not do things like that i bring you revelation from heaven i'll let you know what's going on around the world what god is saying from heaven but i'm not going to do any kind of crazy things like that so don't fall for it because people actually are that's that's my picture but that that is not my facebook page and once again i want to remind people that cat does not know how to send private messages so she will never send a friend request a private message and she doesn't tag people i don't even know what a tag is a dog tag i don't know she doesn't tag people in comments on her post saying you've won money so please just report the people don't click on any links to see if you won money because report that they cannot cash fake it's not me okay they're using my stuff to get to people they already did it once before and now they're they started a whole new page and you know everybody knows people can share stuff from anybody's pages but when they use it for criminal activity they should be stopped and brought to justice at any case let them know you're not falling for it you know they're fake you know it's a lie and then report them please again it would be have a picture of me sitting on the sofa next to my uh beautiful uh artwork that somebody gave me i held it up so they could see it yes you saw it okay if you see that picture it's a fake here i am right here in my studio i'm alive okay just watch for anything that looks like i'm asking you for money or i'm having prizes to give away that's not going to happen or if i if you give me money i'll give you a personal word yeah i don't do that either you can't pay for words people god has something to say he'll make sure you get it i

i do need uh pastors both to come up here i have some mantles to give out both of you if i go there's going to be mantles and he doesn't do you know i can't just say it i have to do it that's the way it is with me so um yeah god has highly honored you and who wouldn't right i mean even a little bit of time i've known you you're passionate you show people and you're hungry and you are so determined and fierce those are the kind of people god needs to do things for him those who want to be quiet and are you know i i hid in the i didn't hide he had me hidden for years but now of course with pink hair you can't hide so be glad he didn't ask you to have it he was going to make sure i couldn't hide and i was known by 40 pastors in our city i did all kinds of things for them my dad did we just love people we didn't care who you were we loved you about we were fierce against the darkness and you are totally fierce against the darkness and i absolutely love the name of your church because i have friends who are some of the hosts and uh you may think that is strange don't think it's strange angels appeared all over the new in the old testament and actually came and ate with uh you know some of the greats of that day but you don't worship them okay it doesn't actually say you can't talk to them if someone if one gives comes to give you a word from god make sure you by the way i have to add this in there always test the spirits there are groups out there teaching you to you know send yourself somewhere and do all kinds of things but you have to test and if an angel appears to you and says come with me you better ask them are you of the spirit of the most high god who sent his son to die for the sins of this world because if they're not they will disappear and they can't answer wrong with that i've done that since i was real little i always would test them even though i go to heaven all the time and i'm around angels all the time they live over my home in my home and if something appears to me though i will still ask them that there is a safety measure that needs to be taught because more and more pastors will find out we are connected in the spirit realm with heaven that's where our rulership is we don't rule over people we rule over all the darkness trying to control people and some some of those beings those demons can appear as angels of light and stuff like that i mean they can they can be very convincing like the left is trying to be right now but anyway just test the spirit so don't reject something i want god wants okay he wants you to know him he wants to know all about him he wants you to understand who you are why he sent you in this particular time on the earth this is a powerful time the divine decade but then also 24 years in the white house god will have total and then after that that 24 years prepares us for the next 100 years if you thought you were leaving you're not going anywhere so don't hide get your crown on roll up your rapture rug you can keep it for later or someone down the road someone generations from now might need that okay and i just need to say this for free the holy spirit say is free the rapture will not be a rescue party it will be a celebration of such glory and power it is a party say it's a party it's not a rescue party it's a party party so uh i i knew what was coming before you invited me because you know he told me and he said you're gonna give out mantels to them they both are going to get mantles for this new season and um that's why when he had me send that word through sunil he said bill bill bill he is serious about the broadcasting i believe you will have a network one day because you already taken authority in that whole system and the frequencies in the in the in the ways that come through to produce that you're already ruling in that and by the way the first thing he wants me to tell you is you have reached the level of king in the spirit realm and uh only god chooses who the kings the lords and the priests are those are spiritual levels of authority that's why he says you are kings and priests and to your god that's not just a title that is a position and i know the church doesn't always talk about that either but i understand it completely what that means so you reach the level of a king in the spirit realm you can't go any higher than that you're not god okay we're lower than him but in the spirit according to dominion and authority a king is as high as you can get and it comes because you fell in love with jesus first you can't skip jesus okay we can't skip the word of god you can't just elevate yourself somewhere i know people have put themselves in the five-fold ministry that never belong there and they can get away with that but you can't get away with saying you're a king because when you declare a decree nothing will happen if you're not but the kings actually have very high rulership and any king even in the natural realm you have an army so does the king in the spirit realm and this day i didn't just come by myself i came with millions of the army of heaven that i i command them get used to that word say we command because he commands god said here you're going to get some revelation on the scripture now when god said command ye me he wasn't saying you tell me what to do he was saying me i want to see you command yes command you me me i want to see you command and that's what he meant we have authority and dominion jesus said i give you power over all the power of the enemy not some of it some of the time all of it all the time but when you rule and take authority over it you're ruling and so the greater you get in those levels of authority you increase in many ways and so we may have had angels helping us in the past but since 2014 a scroll was opened in heaven that had the words on host initiative okay it's that host initiative that's what i'm wearing right here this is their logo they have a logo and it represents the army of heaven working with us but we are not we are over angels right in authority the angels are not over us do you understand that it says in the ages to come we will judge them is that right that means we have seniority because we are we came from the heart of god he made them by speaking but we were birthed from him and so because you've reached that level of king he has sent with me one million of the hosts of heaven that are being positioned here i brought my staff i didn't bring it here with me but i brought my staff to decree for them to be here and so they're actually outside this building right now one million that you will command you will send them you'll give them orders to go and do things in the spirit realm pull down strongholds that you see evil or where wherever evil and wickedness is going on and i mean for instance i take power over all the part of the enemy trying to cheat lie and steal and hide and cover up so i command the host of heaven to go uncover all that that's being hidden no matter where it is how long it's been there or what it is you will go now in jesus name and uncover all of that pull down the strongholds of satan that are helping them empowering them inspiring put down those strongholds that they no longer can assist them in any weightless ever shred platforms the evil high levels of evil and spirit realm are operating in over our country over all the stuff we command the host of heaven now you go and shred those platforms when you do that fear begins to fall on the humans doing the wickedness as long as satan is working with them empowering them and inspiring them they feel bold they feel like they own it but when that is removed they no longer have that this is how you rule the spirit realm that's taking power over all the power of the enemy i'm not controlling people but i'm totally telling through the host of heaven they were made to war for us you don't want the spirit roman battle anything right we are more than conquerors they are a weapon for us weapons are not natural they are spiritual right they are mighty say they it didn't say it in the bible they are mighty to the pulling down the strongholds and one of the ones those weapons is the army of heaven and we get to command them if you're not playing games in the darkness they hearken unto the word of the lord in you so what you say if it doesn't sound like the lord or if you're out there blasting people crushing and hurting people with your mouth or your spouse or whatever you're doing that's not godly they don't have to listen to you so there are requirements okay you've got to have accountability if you have an authority like that you have to god knows he can trust you he trusts them that's what he said to me so this day you are being right now your army outside right now you need to say i choose to invite heaven's army to be my weapon to fight against the darkness i receive them right now [Music] and i i have i have two mantles that came out up here uh this one actually belongs to both of you but this one is just for you [Laughter] i'm going to give brenda hers first isn't it beautiful and so is she to him so chief you're beautiful to the lord and so he wants to bless you with his mantle and it's got many pieces in this mantle it's all the things you'll get to do that you desire to do because you have been willing to do those things that aren't the best that aren't always comfortable there are always uh uh that that maybe other people would not want to do you've been willing to say yes to love people for him to support your husband to love your husband i would say love your husband love your husband you've been willing so he is giving you this is actually a mantle of beauty beauty from heaven and you will get great reward do this so this is yours in this day and i can tell you that we are seated in heavenly places because he takes a layer of our soul that looks just like you the layers in your soul are images of you those are your emotions when you give yourself to jesus christ he has the right to take that and he seats it with him in heavenly places so you are really seated it's not just something suggested it's not symbolic there is a layer of view in heaven looks just like you and at this moment he just put that mantle upon you it is a mantle of greatness greatness love and beauty and so there you go get ready for great things to happen and fun things to happen okay amen and i know this is another mantle [Music] this is a mantle of presidential favor and even though it has trump's name he is president he will sit as president for four more years no matter what anyone else says that is god's plan so he's putting on you not just for this president but for many presidents to come you will have favor from god and they will have your ear to hear god and your hand in friendship so this is a mantle right now of governmental authority presidential favor that's what he called a presidential favor and that includes you and your wife but he wanted me to place it on you as a head come here you just get underneath there too there you go so father right now i i establish and set upon your children the mantle of presidential favor which means they already have favor without measure with you they will have facial favor without measure with the presidents with president trump and with other presidents coming and so long as you have them hear god they will carry and operate in this mantle and they will find out very quickly that is going to begin soon so receive it in jesus name and i bless them god and i thank you for the army of heaven that's been assigned to them father that it will continue to grow the more you send them the more you get them i thank you father in jesus name so be it yes and i have one more gift for you this is a sign of my personal friendship with you i have one i got one for you the same so thank you for being my sister [Music] god bless you god bless you there you go wear it well amen now when i came i already posted a thousand of the hosts of heaven from my own the army that he gave me to command i lost number i don't even know how many there are and we can actually do that today for whoever wants to you have to invite i know this protocol for heaven did you not invite christ into your life is that right i hope you say yes you invite it's the way heaven is you invite christ to come into your life you must invite holy spirit to indwell you is that correct you have to invite heaven to be a weapon for you no they were created for that the army of heaven was never ever designed to protect heaven they don't need it and actually they didn't even get to throw lucifer out and one-third of the angels they didn't get to throw them out they wanted to trust me i don't know what all these people think about this whole thing going on they said there was sadness in heaven they were weeping they were rejoicing they threw a party when they were kicked out god does have a government in heaven and he has a way that he operates that he doesn't abide evil it gets unseated it gets kicked out and that actually did happen in heaven one day and so those angels understand stuff that we're going through right now they understand what we're going through some people have lost family members over this whole thing they really have they've lost businesses and business partners and even churches have split people love churches because they're choosing the wrong thing the wrong thing right you cannot choose or partner with darkness and think you're not going to get some kind of a consequence of that you cannot side with those who want to take the life of people who have no love for anybody that always is a sign that the enemy is involved when life want to be taken or controlled or crushed uh god never put america here actually didn't put anyone here for that reason but america was made specifically by god for his own purposes in his plans his will his way that's why even here in america as we have fought so many times to keep our ability to be free but you don't have the right to hurt crush and bash people and i think the other half the left side doesn't even know what that means they have no lives matter actually is what they ought to be if you want to know the truth no lives matter to them no lives matter to them not even the people they're using matter to them they don't care this is the way the enemy is satan doesn't care who he uses he doesn't care who he destroys he doesn't care who gets stolen from and as i so today i am going to talk about america i can't help that that's god's biggest thing right now with me back in 2015 the beginning god caught me up to heaven and said um trump's going to win and he'll be in the white house for eight years because i need him there even though it might seem impossible it's going to happen he said i'm going to shift america onto my timeline and into righteousness and he said i even have inventions and things to be created that i will not allow to be created until i've dealt with the darkness that's in the government and great exposure to levels people never dreamed of this is still god speaking to me will happen he said it will be great some people will not understand it they'll think i've abandoned them i have not abandoned them i'm actually setting up their lives for the next 100 years [Applause] this country is a light to this world that light will get greater the body of christ will learn how to operate in authority and dominion and it will be so hard for anything like what we are experiencing to ever happen again not until the perilous time is coming nobody knows that day don't plan your life around when the perilous times are don't plan your life around the rapture you have way too much to do we're just beginning to understand the operations of the spirit roman even who we really are we are meant to be in authority in this earth we're not under anything if you belong to jesus christ he's not under anything either on earth as it is in heaven is what god has always desired and yes god does have a dream it is him and mankind operating together as one and so great days have to happen on this earth there has to be those days and everybody thinks well some people think i always get corrected but if i change what i just instantly said the holy spirit just tell me what to say some people think it's the end because things are so awful they're not awful okay i know they may be hard and inconvenient and i know yes people have been affected by this that was not god's plan but there is an enemy in this world and when he can find people who are wicked and evil to do his plan they're going to do it if they've already said yes to him they're going to do it and that can affect our life but in the future it will be much harder because of the discernment we'll be walking in the understanding of who we are living and taking authority uh practically almost everywhere in this world wherever the body of christ lives he actually is going to create regions of light in this country probably the first country because he calls this god called his gift to this world i know his son is but he means literally it is a gift for hope for a future where to find him how to know him how to live free free in order to live free you have to have justice you can't be free without justice so what is god doing today serving out justice [Applause] he said i could not allow trump just to win normally he won oh trust me he won he did win but he said i couldn't let him win the normal way because the darkness would have remained hidden what he's got planned for us is so great and the ability to do things and help people and even change things drastically for the better and the greater would be a better word to use for the greater of god's purposes in this country he had to deal with the darkness that's been hidden for years so he already had a plan it wasn't the scam democrat and it wasn't the pandemic which by the way has been lied about most of the time because god said they'll use anything they can to keep people away from each other keep their mouths muffled and not speak and say anything don't let them gather together because then they'll know truth because they'll be together it's they're too strong together so they came up with a lot of these plans amen [Applause] and all this that was going on god said i haven't changed my plan it's working and he said i will the only one i'll be the only one who gets the glory for all this but of course he wants the glory amen so he already knew this stuff would happen he knew it but we who are the body should always remain strong really strong if you represent christ in this world you represent heaven on earth we represent heaven on earth one day you'll go there if you die y'all stand at me what if you chose you to remain but if you're here for the millennial reign would you want that there will be some that will i'm not planning on dying he won't let me talk about dying he won't let me talk about retiring there is no retirement okay you don't retire in heaven you have a lot of fun and recreation and using your powerful gift that you love whether it's tennis or horseback riding or running a rodeo or a old antique car show or if you're a baker if you're in the theater it's all in heaven it's your gift he put it in you before he sent you here raise up a child in the way in the bent in the gift i gave them to be and they'll never depart from it that's actually what that scripture this revelation it's one of the first things he taught me he said parents that sit there all week long trying to figure out what their child's spiritual gift is is true we'll all sit here and figure out what what is my spiritual gift well in heaven you don't use your spiritual gift people that's why we all think we'll be bored it's the passion he put in you it's what he gave you that you're good at that you think about night and day if you could be paid to do it you do it your whole mansion is being designed around that gift if you were gonna have a rodeo you'd have thousands of horses you have all the property you have real supernatural places for people to come and be a part of that and the horse would be yelling you the whole time oh i'm bucking you [Laughter] it's heaven but right now he wants you here he needs you here he needs you to not just be he doesn't want you just to wake up he wants you to wake up stand up and stand out you need to stand out by the way you live your life the choices you make that you make your stain and you don't back down you do not let fear interfere in your life fear should have no part of you he has not given us a spirit of fear and i know a lot of people think well he didn't send you know spirits of fear no in your spirit man he never put fear that is something that comes from the enemy the enemy brings fear but god didn't give you a spirit of fear he didn't put fear in your spirit man it's not even in you he doesn't send you with it in you you should be free from that he wants you again you know who you are in christ when you become dangerous against hell they don't want to be around you they beg not to be assigned to you do because they know when they go back and they haven't fulfilled their assignment to get you dragged into the darkness they will be beaten satan doesn't reward anybody he does control with fear even in hell so his plan is for us all to be dangerous against then there's no way fear can get in you there's no place for it to even enter in you're so full of him so full of the authority he gave you and the knowledge of him and understanding and having revelation from him revelation on the word revelation is a lifestyle heaven culture isn't just a something it is a lifestyle then you are dangerous and every word that comes out of your mouth will be powerful because it's filled with love with life with hope he said always be ready with an answer yeah the issue is there but the answer is him so how well do you know him if you want to know him more you pursue it amen i was raised as a child one of fifteen i knew it wasn't about me when i was three why because there were others already in the household by the time i was eight i was a mini parent i didn't have anything given to me on a golden platter but i sure was watching those platters 60 loads of laundry a week 50 pounds of potato a week to peel and all those chiefs to watch over because none of them were indians okay none of them don't mean that in the wrong way they were leaders and they knew it that's why he had to give a sear into the household they couldn't get away with nothing i knew what they were doing if i was not even there i wasn't easy to live with i'm still not easy to live with we'll go place oh we need to pray about that okay don't go in there don't sit there cleanse it for the kingdom there are scum on it i don't sit anywhere without going i cleanse it for the kingdom let me never switch mics it's probably my electron whatever oh does it you having a there is an electro energy i can't remember how they tell me i can't wear a watch even in the natural is speeds it does something so god made me before he sent me he sent me as a seer that is god's right but there are people who have that gift that also can the enemy knows if you have that gift by your reactions and how you how you respond and say things about things but so since it was little i could see angels or demons i saw either one and by the time i was like 10 11 12. i knew how the enemy operated i could go tell people don't go there don't do that this is what happens in the spirit when you do that you don't want that to you know and they look at me like i was wild i didn't care he also gave me an attitude of i don't care i don't care what you think it doesn't bother me i am not afraid of the face of man i've seen the face of god and by the way yes you can see the face of god if you receive jesus christ as your savior you think you're going to get holier when you get there you think you have to have a special pass when you die to get into the throne room to see him say no you've been washing the blood of the lamb your name is written in the lamb's book of life he is building your mansion i do love it that he used john the beloved the one who jesus loved i i just john was a showman he really was he was the son of thunder what do you think yeah him and his brother used to fight over pretty girls in the beginning of jesus ministry one day god the father took me back and showed me a day in the life of christ when he was just starting a minister and he had the the rabble i'm talking about the disciples the ones who were with him right and they had left people and they left things that they were doing and luke had patience running down the street asking him why did you leave us for him this is this is a this is him going into minister christ and all these people they were throwing stones at the tax collector because the tax culturals didn't usually go out and mingle they stayed in their little shop okay and you come in paid but when cuz because he was out there he was a target so here's them they're ducking from the stones for him listening to the patients yelling at luke why did you leave him for us and then there's james and john fighting along the side of the road over two pretty girls this is jesus a mighty man sent by god to share the good news and this is who's walking with him and there's the other one with his hand in the money bag all the time and the father said i didn't make it easy for him either because i also am the ce ceo of one quest international i actually do have a position i have a corporation it's called one quest for one god to create heaven on earth to reveal and create heaven on earth and so i do have uh i worked in the business world for 25 years and i loved it then god said okay i'm taking you out of your cushy job i'm taking you out and then i'm going to take your husband out a year later so you're really going to have to love me and believe me we slept on people's floors for a while i still celebrated i didn't change who i was i worshiped i gave i served the whole time we were sleeping on people's floors and people thought we were crazy and my daughter spent their birth each had a birthday sleeping on somebody's floor we ate whatever was there put everything we had in the storage and just trusted god at the end of one year somebody walks up with keys to a million dollar condo at pond division beach and said here you go just stay here long as you want didn't cost us a penny or a dime because we did not change who we were even in the midst of something that people would say it was a disaster my own daughters called it an adventure they belong to me okay we had adventures we never had disasters we never had a crisis it was an adventure you have to live like that so people see you if they don't understand oh no i love him more than anyone else i'm in his hand not some other somebody of the person's hand i trusted him it's a way of life and then i said yes every time he wanted something every time he required something to me i never said never said no to him i'll be almost 70. i forget how old i am it doesn't matter i'm getting younger because i'm claiming timeless you tell me that one day do you want to old do you want to get old well not particularly well then do you want to be timeless i said yes he said whatsoever you say you don't doubt in your heart but believe that it will come to pass you'll have whatever you say so i'm timeless and i have pink hair and god asked me to have the pink hair that really gets some pastors not the black ones oh no girl they like this there's a white woman who preaches and she has a pink hair we gotta have her come that's not what the white one said you are too over threads you have fallen off the edge god would never do that no we can't do that to the people and say your people come to my meetings they will find some way to find me because they want revelation about heaven about god about who they are they're hungry you need to take it up a notch in your church [Applause] it is very true i have like what fifteen thousand black friends i do and they won't let me leave they make me they make me speak four or five hours they don't care if people miss dinner if they miss lunch they don't they don't even care they reset the clock i don't know how many times i went to this one church i went to this really nice church i was invited i went to help rescue this little woman pastor she was gonna get out of the ministry because she was being beat up by other pastors saying she didn't belong there and so i went to this little tiny place outside of washington dc and after three days she was ready to never quit and this other the other they found out about me so they come so i stayed in like this little hotel that had cracks under the door that you know you stuff things underneath it hoping nothing to crawl in that's where i had to stay when i was there and then the other one said oh we found out you're in the area we're going to let you minister and they sent limos and they put me in the wealthiest hotel in washington dc and they had a congregation of 5000 people and i had given all my money to this other little pastor to help her and um and god said he he gets so blessed that my heart is to love that was my my earthly dad heart was to whatever i get i'm giving away that's why i have margaret margaret was created to make money and keep it i was created to give it away so he had to put us both together she's my sister-in-law by the way and she married my brother that took enough bravery right there you ever heard me talk about rj there's margaret she's r.j's wife his solution to all this would just be to kill all the bad people send him to hell then we'll have a nice nice time to that with my brother don't ask him to counsel you if you are in sin he will seriously say that i'll get my gun and we'll deal with it and as you're dying over hell maybe you'll change your mind he really gets invitations from black pastors you're a man you come into my church you didn't know you never know what you're gonna get when i speak okay my life was not very normal but rj is my brother he's my older brother and so he got into all kinds of things he'd he would always ask me because you know he'd say i'm i'm braver than you so you won't do this i i did not not like send dangerous things or dumb things but like you won't stick your finger in this tube because i will and you won't and i did and then the fire pit department had to come cut it off those kind of things were seven eight and nine years old so i went through this whole testing time when my brother too finally went you know i'm not dumb anymore i'm not doing it but r.j usually if there's a killing going on they'll be he'll be there before the police they'll find or he'll find the villain for the police board and he also was in the uh in the military also but he's always been so fierce about un injustice he's friends with all of our police department all of our fire department the military and he's about my size and he's not afraid of anything hell's angels invite him into their to do funerals for them because they'd rather get rid of you to look at you but they know he's a godly man and he's he he's a biker he creates hearties and stuff like that so he's not normal he'll minister to people in nursing homes we're about to go to heaven if you're wicked that person he'll send you either there to the other place and i grew up with him was enough to humble anybody trust me so we have all kinds of a mix in my family then we have all the adopted ones like really adopted and so my dad was creative so we always had fun things to do exciting things to do at home feed the 200 pets we could do a funeral for a pet at the drop of a hat i guess god thought maybe one day we'd actually do real ones i wouldn't do a normal one we'd have cake lined up by the casket they'd have it in heaven right we would have to have music we'd have to have dancing and we'd have to have cake if you want to do it the way they do it in heaven that's how they do it in heaven you go up there you're having a celebration party they have lots of cake everybody dances in the throne and the father greets you he gives you rewards you get to go see your amazing mansion and the whole time we're down here mourning and grieving upset we didn't have enough money to spend on them when they don't need it anymore get cremated it's cheaper the holy spirit told me to say that one time tell me to get cremated it's okay we can put the ashes back together that that's what the holy spirit said so there's a holy spirit quote right there straight from heaven we know where the ashes are okay you can't get clean what if you died in a fire and burn up you don't get your body you're going to get that body back people you better be happy about it it'll look amazing in the bible it says you will be known as you are known you can't be someone else and he doesn't want you to be someone else right now don't let people influence you to be somebody you're not he wanted me up here he picked me out of all the tribe of my family i'm happy that he did and i'm happy he put me in america and i'm happy that our country represents and stands for god one nation under god and and the father would talk to me all the time ever since the elections right before the elections the first time he said i'm going to throw you out there so far you'll never be able to go back like go back where i knew the the media would all act up and you are so right he keeps telling me that they'll lose their many of them are going to lose their networks just so you know that right now and other networks will rise up that will tell the truth amen and they'll give us the true news the right not the hidden the stuff you know not not hiding things but letting us know i travel overseas a lot and during this whole first election that they had i got talked to i mean strangers come up to me and go you must be an american it must be the pink hair and we want to know what you think about your president oh we in america love our president don't watch the fake news whatever you do because they won't tell you the truth about anything and this is even like three years into his term and they went you know what they still they have a problem they can't let go of what they first started with which is the bashing and the accusing they said they don't actually give the news you find out almost nothing about what's important you keep hearing it's like they put it on repeat all the time they're just doing the same thing you know why they've convinced their own soul that stuff is true and when you get in your soul you'll choose again what you choose to do or say you'll choose it again that's what happens that's why people who listen to it have changed people who are nice and kind now are not because they've compromised their soul and so the more people go and say oh no you need to listen to what they're saying they're talking what's right i'm talking about the what the people are saying that haven't made any decisions and there's still some who don't want anybody because they don't like anything they're hearing you choose life you always choose life no matter who you vote for you choose life amen god said this day i offer you life and death what does he say and so they've been hiding so actually their whole mess has gotten worse i'm talking about the news media still out there it's important to know what's going on right we need to know news good news correct news unbiased news and he's going to raise up several people i know for sure several christians that will have their own and first class first-rate network it's nice to have a show it's nice to have a show somewhere but he wants a network that can replace the false networks that are out there and i can tell you right now there is great fear in the camp of the left and there's great fear they may not say it but they're great they're terribly they're awfully afraid some are already hiding they're afraid in the news media they're afraid you may see some people shortly leave their leave leave that to get out before they're taken to prison you cannot commit a federal crime and not go to prison a lot of people in the post office that were paid to change ballots add ballots steal ballots and and that's why i always tell people don't mail it in i always said never mail it in don't mail it in it's too easy for people to take and i know there's two point some million votes that were actually taken away uh and even then you know our president still he still won even that and there were created new ballasts that were fed into the thing when they were supposed to stop counting and close down they weren't and i was watching kenneth copeland also that night i was seeing you and he said okay we're just going to go for the evening and then they announced we're going to stop counting the ballots and the holy spirit said yes that's so they can feed all the false ones in he said this is when they're going to do that this is the holy spirit saying they're going to do the big switch this is on the 3rd of november and they're going to they're going to do corruption and fraud they're going to create brand new ballots and replace the ones that they've even harvested people's names off of ballots and change those ballasts and then put those into the electoral machines that's what they did they caught people in illinois that were throwing trump's ballots by the bins into the river they were up they were arrested in time because of course they were doing it but it was filmed and people saw and they threw them in the river the thing about crime if you're going to do if you're going to do a scam or whatever you want to call it if you're going to commit fraud on a large scale you don't have teams of thousands of people with you so you hire whoever's willing to do it but when you hire these small time criminals guess who's going to yell first they have no bond with those people we are bonded by our love for god and our love for our present we have a bond and the one thing they weren't counting on was that we weren't going to go along with their scam you can't convince people who know the truth to accept fraud you just can't convince them and i mean he had these rallies with forty thousand fifty thousand people in it and i've never seen any would buy these people so where did all these millions of votes come from that he had no people to vote for him i don't know why they don't think well i think they're dumb maybe i don't know they think we are but the one thing they didn't count on was the moral majority in this country the moral majority they don't want socialism they don't want their rights taken away they don't want to be controlled or hand-fed okay they don't want to become a third-world country they have families they have a future they want a destiny for their own children that's the moral majority and a lot of those are believers but some even aren't but they still want that kind of life they're not settling and they could put those million dollar ads on all day long the only ones watching them the ones who made them it isn't changing us and there are people who are blowing whistles even in higher places and they're very much afraid but they can't they can't lose face right now they got to keep their momentum not with us they got to keep their own momentum going for the lie they know they they know they stole it they know they cheated they know that they committed crimes but they can't cave in but there's a lot of ones under them that don't want to take the fall so on november the 4th god had said to me when the ground begins to shake and at this time they were still doing all the false stuff when the ground begins to shake you watch for the landslide the landslide that will go cover from the top to the bottom when a landslide starts it starts with a little shaking and as that momentum builds with that landslide it gets louder and louder and more and more is pulled into that landslide until the whole mountain has been uncovered and god said that will be the crime the corruption all of the stuff the lying the cheating the stealing it will all be made known and even though they won't want to report it can you get over that they won't want to report it they cannot stop president trump from being announced as the president amen he said it will start it will start with one phone call and after that one call is made and known everyone else will be getting in line to rat on that whole group and even though it's happening they well they're it's like i think they're in the fantasy they think if they keep waiting long enough they'll convince us to change our minds and just drop the whole thing now we're not giving our life away we're not giving our destiny away we're not selling our family down the river we are here for the purpose that god put us here for and we are not to be controlled amen and i don't know how long it take to get into their heads the other thing legally in the natural you can't call the presidency until all the votes are counted and i don't know if you know this they're now recounting new york they're even recounting the recounting they're going to get to the thing where they can recount all the states they think that need to be recounted they can't call the election there has been nobody called who has become president the media is just making it up hoping we'll believe it i'm not believing that that's not god's plan and that is not what will happen we don't have to settle in our lives right millions of people i want you know this have prayed around the world who aren't even americans [Applause] because they don't want america to become a third-world country we stand for justice liberty and freedom and we help many other countries and have and still will they don't want to see us they don't want to see us fail and even they don't believe the lie and they don't even live here just with statistics and proof it's called proof people even with the proof that all these millions of people are following and supporting trump they still had a plan they already planned this they had this plan before he even started running again they knew how they would steal it they knew that they could do it they knew there was a way to do it they knew they could pull it off they knew if the media would be on their side that that's all what everybody would believe but they didn't and so i wanna i wanna encourage people don't talk about losing you don't talk about losing when god is still working his plan why we have already won we have already won we won because we voted we won because we prayed we won because it was god's plan and all that is needed in the natural realm has already happened for president trump to keep his seat amen and and god a god god who knows everything of course he told me because i'll just be walking around all of a sudden he'll just start talking to me when i say god i mean the father yes i hear jesus all the time people find the craziest things to say about you one thing you don't even know jesus you don't mention him oh yes he is my first love and i talk about him all the time you must not be listening to the right videos i have nothing without him i am nothing without him i'd have no future i would have nothing but i do have him and i know him well i know what happened to him on the cross i know what happened to him in the garden i know what happened to him in hell i know what happened to him when he went back to heaven and poured out his blood on the mercy seat i know what was happening in hell when he was pouring his blood out in the mercy seat the loser was in hell groveling in the dirt of hell stripped of all his gemstones broken and beaten by the son of god and no longer had the keys to hell death and the grave so he took his beauty and he took his authority away from him that gave us absolutely the right to operate in authority in this world satan is a false king he's not even a king he's a false prince a false one who never was given authority or the right to do anything he took what he wanted and used it while he can and that side no matter what name you give them that does the same thing as all the same thing is always what satan wants he wants it his own way he wants people to worship him he wants him to only exist with him and that's what happens no matter what you put name or tag you put on that that is satan's plan is to kill steal and destroy every person and everything that's why he is afraid of america satan hates america because it causes them more problems than any other country because we preach the gospel from here we train people and send them with the gospel we go over there and help people learn how to give the gospel we feed people everywhere we're doing kind acts we care about people we rescue people for him if you were the enemy you wouldn't want any of that so what is your plan i'm going to take over i will deceive them this thing's going to stop i can't take it anymore it's not working with my plan i'm going to take over this country i'm taking it for myself there's enough wicked people here i can already get to use to do that but what he didn't count on was we have the truth living in us it's not something we hear is something that lives with us and the one who brings the truth lives in us why would he think we would believe a lie [Applause] you need help if you want to believe a lie we'll have deliverance right now you walk in the truth you live the truth you breathe it you speak it he came to set us free [Applause] justice is on one of the steps of his throne huge words justice yes he wants justice yes he wants accountability yes he wants people to pay for the things they have done wrong but those who are at the top that lead others into it are in even more trouble with god when you deceive others to join you and twist the truth and ruin their future and ruin their destiny and so many have been brought into that place right now and i always encourage them if you're listening go tell the truth while you still can go repent and they'll cur turn them in tell the truth about the crimes that were committed and i have sent the host on a daily basis to encourage people who committed those crimes to tell the truth do it now while you can don't wait till it's too late you'll go to prison you know satan tells people things all the time do you know the spirit of god does too he can speak to people to inspire them to encourage them and heaven wants us to remain free because he has god has a plan i'm telling you for 24 years in the white house he's not willing to tell trump oh you can wait four years and then i'll put you in then can you imagine the one who made everything holds the air you breathe no has been from the beginning then they've been could you ever see him oh i guess i'll have to change my plan we don't understand his ways but we need to everything that's happening is to set us up for the next 100 years the inventions that are waiting they're just beyond your imagination that god's gonna send to this earth to help people and make their life better cancer will be here no more i really believe they already have a cure they just don't want you to know it there'll come a time as this administration trumps administration and then pence is after that for eight years and then i i live prophecy i live it and he doesn't just show me a few years i clearly know what will happen for the next 50 years clearly have seen it and been there god's not changing his mind in his master plan for america he needs who he chose in that office when he chose him to be there and he is not willing to let the enemy have those times some of the greatest leaders in the body of christ are still being born who is throwing mountains into the sea who's walking on air are raising the dead that were cremated who's stopping an earthquake and make it go back the way it was before it came including the dead being raised and the buildings going back together that's the greater works why would he all of a sudden decide i just don't want this his son died so he could have that happen the death of his son and resurrection of his son was so these things could happen in this world that he created so they could happen and people would know there is a god he told me he was erasing the gray area that existed in america what's the gray area the one saying there is no god that is getting smaller and smaller there come a point where people know i'm either in the darkness or i'm in the light there's there's no hiding there's no wondering you know who people believe and what they live they'll either live in regions of darkness and it will be legal and they'll be living in regions of light the great light the greater light regions and cities sometimes more than one city and people will drive their dead family members in there and they'll come to life that's how powerful the presence of god will be the authority of the believer will be great in these regions of light sickness can't abide no crime i saw demons flee like dust out of these cities to get out because it was painful for them the annoying king that was put in you when you were born again is painful to the enemy what anointing the anointing that breaks the yoke you have it first john 2 27 there's a scripture for all you who want that it's in the bible i have a little cd i made and we made it in this very old church because the pastor thomas he gave himself up and ran from a denominational church they tried to steal his church in mississippi in the heart of mississippi in this little tiny town it says little town where big things happen and it's one little pastor stood up to all the other religious people trying to shut him up and didn't want him speaking about certain things and so finally they said in in two weeks you'll be out of here and he stood up in the church and he was the pastor and he said okay i'm leaving now whoever would like to follow me and have life and have holy spirit just come they all left with him i think he had four elders left and he started this church it was never got really huge but man the impact it had on that whole little town and he found out about me i think i went to his place like eight times in like two years and they ended up by getting people together and they trained them and trained them in the host and they ran witchcraft out of town they ran it out i mean you talk about manifestations they they had them everybody was afraid of the witches and uh god said when you go this time witchcraft will be run out they will run it out and when we were leaving down when margaret and i were leaving we had pictures in the sky of a witch leaving town leaving town those people are so determined we want to be free from the effect and the control witchcraft is not a joke don't watch it don't watch it don't read it it's all about controlling people that's what they're for it's not a joke one of the things coming one day because you know whenever god does some great things the enemy brings in a counterfeit right well people will begin to know okay well i can't believe this lie anymore it's too obvious that god is here it's going to get more and more obvious that there is a god his name is jesus christ and so it will be hard for the devil to come up with new things but one of the things he will have at that time will be good witchcraft because all the movies are preparing people for him oh in front of people they'll raise the dead and heal the sick and say you can still be a witch see this thing is coming we have to be powerful we have to be strong we have to be fierce we have to understand uh it says in all your getting of wisdom get understanding that is knowledge of the holy one and how he operates that's why these days have to come they have to have manifestations of the power and the passion and the plans of the living god because that is the one thing we can come against it with because there will be a lot of impressionable people think oh this is a good thing they have not one ounce of discernment in their being because they've been fed it by movies and books oh there are good witches they're against the bad ones there are no good witches and they've been around for a long time and the bible says have nothing to do with a necromancer go look it up there were never any good ones in the old testament there were never any good ones in the new testament and there are no good ones now don't consult a medium or a psychic you're getting this for free don't consult them if you did lose it from your song repent for it they don't work for god he's fivefold ministry his prophets or prophetic people anyone can prophesy make sure you're accountable in your life and your actions right and you know how you get more you step out and do it you step out god gives you word if he's like you're going to explode and burn inside you need to say that you're also not accountable for forcing that person to do it i'll save you some grief if you deliver a word from god it's not your job to make them do it you're going to start a whole different war you deliver it let the holy spirit work on them not your job and the hardest people to prophesy to are your family my family still wants to know what's for dinner when laundry's gonna be done even though they have they have all this revelation he knows how to keep you humble give your family [Laughter] and even if i go too long let me know i just gotta talk about jesus bless the lord jesus christ and all that he's done more than any of us all put together he's been through it all he really has the hardest part was the garden not the cross he died before he got there he died to the father's will if it be possible let this cup pass from me because what was in the cup wasn't in him it wasn't anything he ever would do or want to do but what had to be nailed to the cross was what was in the cup that's the only person who can forgive our sins is him he's the only one that drank all that sin in and nailed it to the cross no one else can say they can forgive sins no other religion no other god none of them in the garden was the most important thing he did when he said but not my will let your will be done and two angels were sent from heaven i got to talk about this cup when jesus when he was on the earth and it would say even when he had his disciples especially after he got the disciples he'd go away to the mountain to be with his father he'd go see him he'd meet him and talk to him and he went there and he took him a cup god his father made him a carpenter he put business in his son so he would have a door to speak to anybody anywhere that's why he likes business people you get more invitations if your business right and so i also opened a door for him to talk with sinners all the time they wanted him to do he was a master carpenter not just a finish not just a little finish she was a master carpenter joseph was a master carpenter so he made on purpose for his father he made this cup it wasn't really beautiful it was wood of course very perfect mastery the way he made it in the handle was beautiful and so he met with him and gave it to him this is about his um second year into his ministry so when the father had to choose he already knew this would all happen he had to choose a cup to put all that in and he knew his son would have to drink it or the plan wouldn't work the plan was to for him to die for our sins that we might be free that we would have a way back to the father so the father got that cup and he put all that stuff in it he chose two angels from a gabriel's group because gabriel angels look more like humans with wings most of the army look like creatures i mean some have eight eyes some have weapons coming out of them they're an army so he picked two of gabriel's that already the lord knew who these angels were he knew them he knew them when he was in heaven and they brought that cup to him and they were in the garden the whole time and ministered to him while he was having to drink this cup but as part of their reward god does reward as part of the reward for willing to do that it would be very hard because they couldn't come against anybody there who was coming to take him the army actually probably had the hardest time because he was the lord of hosts the army of heaven he was over all the armies of heaven christ was and and they loved him and so it was probably very hard they were all told in heaven this was going to happen they knew it so they didn't come down and beat up people or rip up the people that were going to try to crucify him i'm sure they wanted to do that because to defend to protect him would have been their number one thing when christ came and was sent down to earth and made into a little seed and planted in the womb of mary they already knew they couldn't go down there and fight for him if you remember what he said before the sanhedrin court if i wanted to do you remember he said that if i wanted to he was letting them know i'm not i'm not who you really think i am i have the ability to do these things i lay down my life but if i wanted to i could call the army of heaven these creatures are like 150 200 feet high they have eyes where you wouldn't even think guys would be they have spears coming out that shred the enemy when they spin the the in satan's army they they have all kinds of weapons they turn into missiles and go to where the battle is and they come back to be their self and then they go in there and attack he could have called them to fight for him if he had said even one word they would have come but he knew he had to die so these two angels were in the garden with him their reward was they also were chosen to be in the tomb with him and they were the first ones to see him when he came back up from health i was recently in israel they're still outside the tomb they still protect it's a holy place they're still there they're on assignment they were the first ones who got to see him they're also the ones that talked to the disciples they talked to mary and they said why are you looking for the why are you looking for him he's not dead those two same angels were the ones who were in the garden with him with a cup so god does give rewards angels get rewards for completing what they were sent for now in this time they are millions of them have been sent to fight on our behalf we have the right to command them because they were made like a military and you can't go to an army a natural army and say would you mind please going over here and doing that could you imagine standing before hope or gay going to ship them out somewhere would you mind would it bother you uh please i have a request would you mind going over that they would look at you like you were nuts the army of heaven is the same way they need orders from headquarters well headquarters is here because the lord of hosts lives in us and they have been very very busy over these last few months and even more so now to make sure every single thing gets exposed they know where everything is nothing is hidden from god he knows where every stolen ballot is he knows where every every machine it was messed with or tampered with or changed or whatever he knows the name of every person who participated he is not clueless and he meant it when he said the exposure will be great so he said i said well what do you want me to do now i mean i i pray every night i'm not i call it prayer communication i talk to god if i have a request i spend another time just getting to know him i would just spend time talking to him like he was right here because he is and one day he walked through the wall of my home now he walks through the wall of my home all the time but they need you need to give them commands they can't take a written prayer request okay they can't do that back in the day even in the old testament i think it's in isaiah it said that the israel was under a siege for something i remember what it was and it said the captain of the host that's michael went to the far ends of heaven and gathered the army of heaven to come and fight on behalf of israel so that's the way it normally was done until 2014 there was already a major shift into our authority and dominion and i can tell you this the army of heaven cannot they cannot finish the whole purpose he made them if we do not do this they were always designed to fight for us amen i just want to assure you that trump i hear my in my ears all the time trump's winning trump's winning he's sitting in the white house he's going to sit in that white house he's not going to be evicted he will sit there and you'll begin even more and more to see him bring pension on different things because he'll be preparing him he will be preparing him to be president after him how do i know god said so i say what god says and i show you things that he showed me and he will sit in that white house and to me it doesn't matter what date they give that it is happening it's happening i've even already received a request to come and do um to pray for the president vice president at the inaugural prayer breakfast because guess what they're carrying on with their plans too [Applause] they're preparing like none of this ever happened they're already scheduling events for the inauguration making plans hiring companies to do things because they know the truth is everybody stand up for just a minute you don't have to wonder if you've ever been chosen if you're alive this is what caused it if you're alive and breathing you're chosen if you remember the body of christ you have greatness written all over you god's plans have already been written about you and god said these days that we're living now will be sung about in heaven in eternity this so this is not just another time on the earth this is an event on god's timeline it doesn't count time like we do it's all about events and this is an event in heaven part of the divine decade that we'll be living in and the things you'll get to do people have never even seen or heard of on the earth before because you're chosen nobody can tell you you're not i'm telling you you are chosen how do i know you're here if he times your birth on the earth and you are here you are chosen chosen to be great for him chosen to manifest the power of the living god it is a great thing to be a manifested son or daughter he trusts you you don't have to have a real high education it's not about how smart you are it's about how willing pray that my people be willing in the day of my power those who are willing and obedient shall eat the fat of the i know the word i don't carry a bible it's in here we were taught to read the word of god and know the word of god we were taught to pray before we could even speak we had family altar but it didn't make me not want god it made me want him more he loves every person in every country no matter where they are right now no matter who they are no matter what they're doing he still wants them so if he doesn't have us if he doesn't have the light in the spirit realm you have light coming from you some people have great light some people have light some people have darkness in them [Music] so i always know who knows the lord and he doesn't know the lord if there's any way possible now these people have to shake their hand they don't know they don't want me hugging well some might want to hang them it's so important to learn to release the anointing if you don't if you don't do that why did he put it in you to release it [Music] you only got to deposit [Music] it says in first john 2 27 when you receive jesus christ as your savior you receive a deposit of the anointing what anointing the anointing breaks the yoke that's what it is the more you release it the more it grows that was not peter's personal shadow that healed people it was the cloud of anointing because he released so much it builds a cloud sometimes you can walk in the room and it fills the whole room that's any believer any believer you have it in you it's a deposit so the more you give it out the more you get back and it never stops it just grows and grows and one day you feel yourself when you go i release the anointing you actually feel it it looks like blue fire shooting out of you so everybody put your hand here we're gonna stir it up say father i choose as an act of my will as a believer in jesus christ to release the anointing so stir it up okay now i want you to lay hands on somebody next to you and i want you to say with everything within you and you say this and you wait until i say i can feel i can feel leaving you i want you to open your hand the person say i release the anointing in jesus name i want you to see i can already feel it i want you to picture it leaving right here and it goes up your arm like blue fire written out of your arm so if i walk here like i can feel it coming from all of you it's like up here it swirls like a river the fire does everywhere i've been i feel it like waves hitting me right now it's very powerful i want you to say thank you jesus for giving me the anointing encourage me every day to use it wherever i go amen okay y'all stop [Music] [Applause] when i sit in a restaurant i always put my hand on the table and just say i release the anointing and i will see blue fire come out of my hand and coat that whole table it will never wash off it will never wear off whoever sits at that table will get the anointing on them i do the same thing to the glasses to the silverware when you go through a door if you touch the door release the anointing when you slide your card release the anointing everyone who slides their card in that thing will get the anointing on them before you send a text get it typed out let your hand say release the anointing when they open it the anointing will get on them [Music] it is transferable there's no excuse not to do it it is free you will begin really i'm not kidding you'll sit in the seat and get up and someone sits and they'll feel the anointing i can sit and people people's seats like when we used to do i used to do hospitality of our church of 5000. we would do the feed the board every once a year it would be like jesse and all kinds i can't remember other names right now but powerful men and women of god and they get up and leave i wouldn't be in there when they were eating i go sit in everybody's chair i knew who it was i always knew jesse i'd start laughing whoever was i i could feel it it's like light electricity on you if you want to have encounters if you want to feel the power of god it is in you it's already in you when you got saved he put it there you release it you can put on clothing like i prayed over their mantles like i release the anointing every chair in your office including your desk now has the anointing in it it doesn't matter where you go the more you do it the more will come out and you do that one day you'll be shocked and you'll feel it leaving you so when peter would walk past people we did it so much the cloud of the anointing like far exceeded him and when they said his shadow touched him they were healed and demons came out it was the anointing that breaks the yoke that you have don't ever forget this you have a weapon from heaven that breaks the yoke of darkness put in every gift you give every gift you give release into the gift if you give something away people release it if you give food to people release it don't ever stop doing that one day you walk into a place and people will fall out from the anointing the glory you create glory for god but you also carry the glory how do i know christ in you do you know what that means that's something that's deposited in you too the glory at one point will begin to be released from you it looks like it looks like shock waves of light the glory looks like light the fire looks like fire it feels like i when i see people release it it like shock waves i can almost hear it and it was somewhere speaking somewhere and the holy spirit said go back to the products table and as i started walk through the proxy table people started falling out now i talked about the glory in the meaning guess what it also makes a difference because of your soul that when you speak about these things it increases in your soul you can't hear something and then do nothing you can't do it heaven doesn't operate that way it's your actions along with your words if you want to rule you have to do something who cares what people think so i went to the broader table these people started falling out and i'm like i could feel like wow i could hardly i could hardly stand up on wow god they're really anointed aren't they i heard the holy spirit he laughs at me a lot he was laughing and laughing goes that is coming from you because i was looking no matter what these people are falling down they're lining people waiting to get products and my son-in-law who's my son-in-law just kept right on selling the products i'll always decide now just do this it was funny because okay okay what do i do you said just say already used to glory and i literally could see light waves go like shhh and whoever they touched they started falling down people got healed people got set free and went what is this when the bible goes the knowledge of the glory will cover the earth life the waters cover the sea he said it will cover them because you will be releasing it people will be this not just me this is for the body of christ christ in you is the hope of glory the glory being released showing up impacting people and nations and things and places that god wants you to go to this is what you get as a believer do it in your family's home how do you do that you just start doing it i release the glory i release the glory i release the glory just take time to do it pretty soon you can do that one day and you'll feel it coming out of you if you speak for christ if you share with people if you read your word it's building in you let it out let the anointing out let the glory out fire when the baptism in fire comes it's going to be so powerful it just burns the world out of you it burns any fear you'll never be afraid again the boldness that rises up in you you begin to carry that fire places will actually look like they're on fire buildings look like they're on fire people will see it on you one day his eyes were flames of fire our god is a consuming fire that is spiritual fire that will transform you and places and people because you carry it

yes we are on right now i believe so hello everybody again it's always worth waiting for something from god isn't it and you know we all need extra grace here too sometimes but i don't know how much you heard or i don't know but we're going to start all over again so thank you for joining us i'm very excited that i get to share um revelation from heaven you're going to get news bulletins from heaven during this time you may even get something brand new given to me and if it comes from heaven i'm going to share it but this is the very main purpose for these this broadcast today is to share what time it actually is on god's timeline and many people don't know god has a timeline of course he does he created time and there are certain things he will make sure happen in this earth he made the earth he made us he put us here for a purpose and so guess what he has worked out this whole timeline thing even to the very end which by the way no matter what people say or think or try to calculate or assume only one person knows when the end will actually come that would be the father so even jesus knows that right so we're going to flow with what the father has figured out for this time and he does have a plan even while you're taking a unexpected vacay at home and i'm praying all the time for people you know and in their situations and how this is going to affect them in many different ways i have been outside at night in the street probably for hours praying over all of you and i want to say hi to my friends that would be my pastor friends who've invited me to come and share their place to bring heaven to this earth i'm excited that some of you actually get to see this broadcast and from now on as much as we can we're going to give you all a heads up if you would like to before we go live and then i'm very happy to be with all of you today and very grateful for all that you have done and paid a price for yourself to allow god to invade and inhabit your sanctuaries in your meeting places because you want the more of god and i hope everyone out there you have had an opportunity to be a part of meetings that give you revelation that train you that they don't just give you a nice little message that makes you feel warm and fuzzy but will make you powerful and dangerous against the darkness that's why we are here it's the body of christ that is the audience i'm speaking to right now to those who have been born again who've received jesus christ as your savior those are the ones i'm speaking to anyone else listening you're just going to get blessed anyway and by the way i need to let you know that my words carry the anointing that abides in me the anointing that breaks the yoke of darkness so if you're out there for other purposes or uh you have an agenda of your own zap bam you with the anointing so that when you leave this broadcast no matter what you thought you came here for you will be filled with the anointing aren't you excited about that we need to learn about these weapons god has given us like the anointing i may share a little bit about that later by the way this is not the only broadcast that we'll be making during our little vacay at home stay whatever we want to call that i don't like the word quarantine we don't actually have anything ourself right now and let me tell you we you will learn how to come against every spirit of infirmity sickness or disease before we end because most of the questions i get from people are what do we do about this can we do anything about this you know we're not over sickness what can we do well they obviously don't read the word of god because jesus said the things that he did we will do also in greater works and he was over sickness he was not under it you are over it you are not under it you need to start saying that yourself don't repeat every every doom and gloom thing you hear about today or you know this is the end we need to get ready to escape on the rapture rug i can tell you also this is not time for your rapture rug roll it up and stick it in the closet and as you've heard me say before get your crown on because the word itself says that we are kings and priests and to our god those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion that is something powerful christ gave us you need to learn to rule even in this time even while you're at home or wherever you are right now you know that you can speak words of authority and dominion and take that authority and it starts to change things number one open your front door if there's a lot of arguing going on if there's strife in your home right now open your front door and you evict it out right now you don't want to keep that stuff in your home make sure you're speaking words of hope and life and truth to all of your family and even to yourself so these are just little tips maybe the holy spirit may add throughout this broadcast because he really is the director no matter who we think we are what we're doing the holy spirit is the director of all these broadcasts if he wants something sad that's not on my little tiny tip list here then he's going to say it to me and if he says it you're going to hear it that's one of those news news bulletins from heaven but our primary purpose today is to discuss what time it is on god's timeline so that you be prepared for the future and by the way the main thing he wants me to say to you is this is a temporary situation some people act like it is the end of their life and it's not this is only temporary it will pass like many things that come and go on this earth this too will pass and hopefully you will be stronger and better and more understanding of god himself and be able to ruin reign in your own home learn how to crush the darkness and push it back so you will be stronger yourself and i want to also just add this i have called many different places where i do business with or a frequent and most of them have left the nicest kindest and encouraging messages on their answer machine for everyone to hear when you call just as an example i had to call steinmart because i have to know if i can still come in and make my little payment and guess what they said they said this is just a temporary setback we will be back and when we come back we'll be stronger we can't wait to see you again that should be your attitude not like it's all over oh god what are we gonna do now do we need to take all of our money out of the bank and go hide somewhere in the hills with it number one you can't spend it in the hills and number two i would not do that unless god told you to you're gonna need that bank account you're going to need it to still thrive and not just survive on this surge you're going to need a place to keep your money send your money and spend it and so unless he told you that don't run to the bank and drain your bank account and close everything he'll just be going back and reopening it later this is a temporary situation and i do take everything seriously people said you should be serious about this is really a desperate time i would not call this a desperate time i would call this god's time and i'm going to go along with what god says and what god wants and i'm going to keep my attitude excited and expectant because that's what you should be if you belong to him he knows where you are he knows every hair on your head he knows every day of your life he knows the day your mansion and your mention in heaven will be done he's already planned your homecoming so why not stay excited in your life and you choose to be happy instead of mad angry upset don't let that get into you and whatever you do you need to crush fear don't let fear rule you no fear no interfering of fear in your life and why i keep saying that because a lot of people are also i get listen i get text messages from people who actually have my number i get emails from all over the world i get phone messages left on our phones which we have obviously on our website that anybody can call us that wants to and so after listening to these or looking at these over these last few days i understand that people are in fear they're confused they're in fear maybe they've never faced anything like this before my mom would be sitting right here with her plum switch next to me saying hey they survived the depression this is not the depression it is not a plague and it isn't a disease it is a virus a virus comes and goes it also has a time limit and why have we chosen the symbol for our theme that says god's time and it shows an hourglass like an actual hourglass because the sands of time in an hourglass have a limit and when those sands pass through the hourglass that time is over well that's exactly how we see this whole situation it is a temporary time it is a limited time in your life and i look at this times break in time or moment in time that we're in right now is very special that means i get to spend more private time with god i actually will get to spend time with my family now that's exciting for me since i do so much traveling and i do a lot of broadcast i do a lot of other things that takes up the time on the earth in my life so i'm in one in one way i'm very grateful and thankful that i actually get to spend time with my family or maybe even call the family members i haven't seen in a while i hope you're going to take advantage of that maybe even make a few notes of wow i can spend time doing this instead of just being a fearful or upset or confused get rid of all those things in your life right now and fill yourself with the life of god the plans of god his expectancy you can choose with your own will to take this in one direction or another i hope you take it in one that takes you up and not down in this time god has planned on the earth he's not changing anything it's not going to change his plans or what he's going to do just because a virus is passing through and hopefully will pass out that would be i say rather than passing the virus just pass out and i want to also repeat something you're going to things i've heard god say to me and he this is what he says about this whole thing this is not a government takeover but it is a takedown of the virus so doesn't that sound much better than people yelling the the government's taking over they're going to take everything away we're going to have marshall uh law is going to come in and we're going to be be putting body bags and ships somewhere yes we've heard all these things given to us that is not what god's got planned and don't let your mind go in that direction okay we need to all be in agreement with what has been decided on for our best our government that is in place right now number one god chose our leader he's a powerful man he does love america and he's doing his very best to handle this in the best way and to think that anybody would even consider that possibly the country would work together to try to limit the spread of this uh virus and really care about us and he is talking about financial help i am not um crazy enough to think that that doesn't interfere in your life i understand we have to have money to buy things and to get supplies that we need and my prayer for all of you out there is that god will so inspire you feel you so full of him make sure you think about others other than just yourself because i know right now some people are kind of isolated with themselves but you do remember that all the people in this country are also experiencing the same thing at the same time which is rare okay there's people in other countries and many of them are my friends and i want to say hello to everybody out there who's not in america yes god cares about you too make sure you're speaking life and hope and the power of god and everything you say if people ask you questions about this going on say we hope in our god we trust in our god our god knows and he cares about us and he cares about people other people too so the way you think and the what you say makes a huge difference in the atmosphere of where you live this place i live in right here i call it my dwelling place because it's not a home it's my office this whole entire structure we used to call a home is now our office and i mean it's our studios it's our shipping receiving department it's a duplicating place and we have learned to adapt to that but god has a plan even in doing this this wasn't something negative he planned for us we had to adapt our own lives we do know at one point in our life we will get another home and i will so enjoy that personal space and private place but right now we're giving this place almost to the whole world so you will know who he is why he sent you to this earth what his plans are for you and we on purpose on the hourglass took the h off of the word it's not hourglass h-o-u-r o-u-r it's o-u-r it's our time with god's time it's us doing something together and one of the other things that we'll be talking about maybe not tonight are the keys to the kingdom and they they are so powerfully amazing christ gave us so many things to live with to make our life better if we apply it and that's another major thing for you when you get revelation from god it is not ever something just to hear it's something to live by and there are tips on how we can do that in the earth and make sure no matter what every day when you get up you ask for grace for abundant life it's free it's from god it will fill you with fuel from heaven so i'm going to encourage everybody out there listening let's just do this together right now because like i said i'm here to explain and train so i'm going to train anyone out there if you've not learned about asking for grace for abundant life there's two graces one is grace for eternal life that christ brings us the other one is grace for abundant life that even christ operated in it says in the word that as a child god this is the father filled his son with his grace that was grace for abundant life it's one of the reasons why christ was able to be happy and successful uh living downhill with mankind when he used to live in heaven with his father and then all of a sudden here he is on the earth walking just like you and i facing everything we did but he didn't sin how about that so don't let people tell you you cannot live sin free yes you can you choose but in this time we're going to ask for lord anybody hold your hands out if you're watching right now and repeat these words father i ask for and receive grace for this day for abundant life amen now i can tell you right now i feel it coming into me it's like a shower of a light electricity because i am a seer and uh you know i am a revelator i experience the things that go on in the spirit realm and that was fuel from heaven being poured into me that i will need for this day and if you get that every day of your life before you get out of your bed it won't always be your selfish self showing up it'll be heaven showing up you'd be surprised that just as few words that you've asked for and received will help to change what's in your soul and joy will flood your soul expectancy hope will flood your soul and then you'll be coming out ready for that day and so i hope of all of you who did that you don't never forget that it'll be one of the greatest things that i ever train you in is is called heaven protocol for heaven culture because i've been having many times no one up there is upset or angry or offended nobody's confused nobody losing deception there's no worry there's no anger or wrath up there they live in that abundant life grace so when you ask for you get filled with that it changed me from the first time the father taught me how to do that it changed me it was so important to him that he literally caught me up to heaven before his very throne and taught me that like i was eight years old most of the things god has in his word for us are simple but we in our human mind feel like we have to understand every single thing we reason it out we don't step forward in faith we use reason instead of faith faith is what draws heaven jesus said himself when i do return to the earth will i find faith he didn't say will i find divine wealth will i find uh you know will i find people laughing and celebrating what will i find so one thing he wants to know is will he find faith faith is something that creates for you is something that you can live with and live in every day of your life it is a source that you will even use when you get to heaven okay you get trained to do things in heaven also i won't even share some of those right now because that's going to be our next broadcast but you know what faith is more important than the food you eat or the air you breathe is faith it comes from heaven god fills you with it the more you operate in it it grows until you become very powerful in the spirit and it's hard for the enemy to deceive you these are simple basic truths in the word of god and people always tell me well not always some people say you don't even have a bible it's in here and it's very much alive i was raised by my earthly father who helped to take care of 15 of us how would you like that living here in florida we're in florida i love florida it doesn't snow you know we were from upstate new york we got frozen all the time we were the chosen frozen back then but now we're not and so you need to learn the important things in your life right now i know you say well we need a house to live and of course you do we need food to eat yes and here to breathe but even more important than those you need faith in god you need to be trusting him not just when things are going well but in the other times when things are maybe a little bit challenging or you're struggling with things even if it's something that's not good in your life you're struggling with it god still loves you he wants you to step out and use the faith everybody got a measure of faith the bible says some you need to learn to operate in it so it will grow and it will become productive and it will change the way you live your life in this day you're not supposed to be living in doom and gloom or hopelessness you are supposed to shine like the stars in the heavens by the way we are over those stars we're not even under those stars all that god made whether here or throughout the cosmos he made that for us we are his offspring he is our real father we came from him you need to know about your dna you need to know about the generations that went before you you need to know about the generations that god even had in heaven the ages that have passed down the earth that you don't even know anything about god holds that in his hand if he wanted to right now he could sit in heaven and hold the entire earth in his hand or he could become small enough to step inside you that's who he is he knows everything everything that was that is or ever will be that's who you are trusting right now with your life in the midst of these challenging times you need to trust him and make sure you say that he loves to hear you say i trust you god i trust your father even when i don't understand i am trusting you i will serve no other god there will be no other god before me and make sure by the way you say that to satan he hates to hear that by the way it makes him tremble in these days these few weeks we have of being with our family and being with god make sure you're productive in them make sure you take full advantage of them do fun things with your family create and to be very creative and inventive and adventurous in this time with them so they get hope built in them and not fear what you say what you say with your mouth right now is very important don't declare the doom and gloom don't declare the time has come where everything's going to end when god just brought you some of you have brand new babies in your life right now and children young children did you know he has generations of time planned for them too don't make a decision in your head that it's all over because then you'll be running and hiding you might miss something god has for you these are great opportune times for god to bring something new into your life new jobs new homes new positions do you know that's how he looks at it we need to all be in agreement for him to do what he wants how about if we say god we want your will your way you all know that scripture that talks about on earth as it is in heaven that is his desire for all of us and i know some of the prophets even pastors and leaders if they don't know what time it is you know what they do they go to the end of the bible and they start speaking about the end leaving out generations of time for things that god has planned that hasn't even happened yet on the earth some of the best times have not even happened yet i want to encourage you to seek god on your own get the word and stop reading it there's even scripture in the word that says jesus himself said even though that nation will rise against nation there'll be wars rumors of wars nations will rise against nation kingdoms shall rise against kingdom guess what he says at the end of that but the end is not yet so i will tell you from heaven from god himself the end is not yet so roll up your precious rapture rug and stick it in your closet and maybe get one that says this is god's time and then live by that time yes i know things are different in your life i know that they've said you can't go to church you can't do this nobody likes the word can't but you know they actually have a reason for doing that like i said just a few minutes ago this is not a this is not a government takeover this is a takedown of the virus their purpose is to try to limit the contact between people so that anyone who has that will not be able to spread it they're trying to limit the spread of the virus and you know even it has a time it has a very limited time that it even remains in your body it's a virus remember it's not a disease it's not a plague i think hell's about to experience a plague though it's called the faith of god in his people that's like a plague to them they don't like it they don't want to hear that and uh so we're going to make a lot of hell unhappy a lot of hell's army is going to be very unhappy because we'll be operating with heaven's army by the way they do exist also maybe we should take take seriously the things that god said in his word it is uh is a platform for life and how to live it it even has a time frame in itself but i can tell you you are not in the end day these are powerful days start thanking god for the things that you desire in your life get your children teach them how to ask for that grace do you know i have grandchildren that learned it when they were not even two years old yet and now that they're six and seven and eight if they start to have a meltdown do you know what they do they reach up and they say father i ask for more grace and their meltdown stops you know how this could change the way your children grow and live themselves this is a powerful time to get to teach them revelation that will even inform their whole life their lifestyle and how they live don't run into the darkness don't satisfy yourself with that i know they're even saying you know your entertainment can't take place why not entertain yourselves for a while i want to actually sit down and have conversations with each other i know there's still television out there and there's not much on that eye there is there i am grateful to god that he is taking hollywood which is one of the things he's had me talk about what does that mean that means he's taking that throne away from satan see he's got plans you maybe don't even know about he has big plans for this time god's time he calls it the kingdom age we're in a new season in this kingdom age there was the introduction of the kingdom age and we stepped off the platform into a new spiritual time that never existed you begin to hear new things that god had planned and things that you are able to do yourself and now we're getting into the season where we need to be activated and literally start doing those things i want to thank all those who who follow this facebook live or the my youtube out there you get filled with revelation all the time i hope you're applying that and you know what don't just apply it make sure you share it with others these words are not my holy words these are gods he's given a whole new way to live why not introduce a whole new culture on the earth instead of trying to change it's really hard to change a culture on the earth but why not introduce heaven's culture why not have a habitation of heaven in your home and not the world i'm not saying you have to throw everything out there is some funny things out there that are decent uh there are different games you can get and play or make up some of your own with your family i know my family was very creative growing up uh we had a lot of drama people in our lives and we had a lot of leaders and i can tell you the most challenging children you have right now are probably some of the most anointed that's a tip on letting you know that's why they are like that maybe they have a very powerful personality you know they have a strong will and they're so you know why god likes people who are strong-willed because when they learn his you can't change it you can't make them stop it god says that he likes strong-willed people when he gets him on the path he has nobody can pull them off so maybe that will encourage some of the parents out there who are now doing 24-hour a day homeschooling or home living i bet your children are excited about it they probably get to see you more now than they ever have before and so like i said take advantage of this time maybe have some cooking classes with your children they love to learn to do new things all the time my parents did that with us too that's why i actually do know how to cook and my sister jen who is here where are you jen just say hello i don't like her she gonna come say hello you know i couldn't do this without her i have a whole team of people here some of my family are part of what we do but this is my baby sister we call her number 15. thank you for saying hi jen we got some we have some fun things planned also like we're gonna do j and k in the kitchen i don't know when we'll do that but hopefully maybe during this next two weeks we'll be able to do that and we're actually have some cooking classes for y'all in our own kitchen now you know if i'm doing it's going to be sweets i have a sweet tooth blame it on jesus jesus loved honeycomb he lived on it all the time and i happen to know that before the throne of god people actually leave sweet treats for him because he loves them so we do have something a fun time in the kitchen plan with everybody and maybe you learn a super new recipe that we have for you but we have to have fun in these days also we're going to help you have fun we're going to have the fun depot and one of our events that we have broadcast will be just for children and they will be very excited of course you can listen and you can watch and we'll let you know well in advance we're going to have that we're going to have some really fun things for children and they will love learning about heaven and who their god is so i want you to look forward to this is a special time god can meet your needs you know i'm going to declare right now father i thank you for meeting the needs of everyone watching god and their other family members and those even not watching father i pray that you will give this team who's over this whole uh take now and the virus that they will give you give them great ideas on how to help in finances or even delay payments on things i do want to let you know there are actually already companies you're right jenna need a drink we've heard from companies that are actually going to delay people's payments if you have monthly payments doing different places planet fitness is one of those places if you're ever interested by the way i'm giving them a free commercial i am a member of planet fitness i don't always agree with the videos that they're showing you know on the screens but they have great equipment they have a great plan some of it's very inexpensive and it's a good way to get in shape which the holy spirit has said to us since we've been doing this heaven thing get in shape we have a long race to run but planet fitness has already announced because you know now they have to do all their stuff online and if you if you can sign up and watch it online learn some new exercises and stuff but they've already announced that they are not going to be charging their monthly fees as long as this is going on and you're not able to use their gym they're not going to charge you they're going to withhold your membership payments and i do know that there are other companies out there doing that and there are still some a few restaurants open of course two thumbs up for chick-fil-a chick-fil-a that's a company that was founded by god and is a really promotes the gospel if you work for chick-fil-a you are blessed in this world if you've never eaten a chick-fil-a don't show up on sunday because they will not be open they want to make sure you get to go to church we're going to talk about church in just a minute but chick-fil-a is open i think most of the ones that are is probably drive-through but there's even some that actually can come to the door the restaurant they've taken orders right there and then filling them for you they are actually getting witty ideas instead of just closing it all down because you know we can't meet in the restaurants or meet out in other places and i know you're missing a lot of your special favorite things do you know there's a thing called the royal fast that god taught me a long time ago the royal fast is even harder than the daniel fast you know to eat almost nothing is actually harder than giving up every one of your favorite things and you wouldn't believe it was unless you tried it but on the royal fast that's what he has me do off and on you don't go to your favorite places you don't even wear your favorite clothes okay you don't get to uh go and be with your friends who are your favorite friends you fast that and spend that time with him so i like to look at this as part of the royal fast because you can't go to your sporting events you can't go to your concerts you know you can't go out to your favorite eating places you can't meet with all your 20 or 50 friends you've got i pray god you've got friends and god if there are people out there that don't have any send them good friends who will lift up their life and not crush them down or held back you need friends in your life you need people in your life who are going to inspire and encourage you especially to know god but there are many places and even god i pray for those who have their weddings planned during this time family reunions planned i know a lot of things are getting interrupt interrupted right now i just want to encourage you again as i said this is for a temporary time remember the hourglass thing the sands of time are moving through and eventually this time will be gone and i hope you have great memories that you will create and make during this time make up fun photo shoots with your family but there are a few restaurants still open out there you know just check out and find out who they are get their time frame if you still feel like you need to go there meet with very small groups of people and like here in our city now they have closed the beaches one of my favorite places even if i don't get to go there very often so people were learning this is the thing people were learning that they could not gather inside places and have big events together or just have a party together they started doing it at the beach our beach here is free it's a very long beach a beautiful beach and they started doing that i mean huge groups 50 people here and they were meeting and they weren't listening to what was being asked of them and so now they have closed our beaches i'm sure people are still bicycling up and down you know maybe outside the beach but i just want to encourage you please try your very best to go along with what they have asked us to do for a short period of time and when we do that things are happier the atmosphere is better knowing that we're working with the government or your city authorities or other people who are in charge they're wanting to help to preserve our life and like i said before this is not about limiting our life this is giving the right to live without that virus and father i pray for all those out there if it's already invaded your life family members or yourself god i pray for them and take authority over the sickness jesus was over sickness we take authority everybody to say it together i will no longer tolerate sickness sickness or any virus or any virus in my city in my city in my home in my home and i command it and i command it to go to go in jesus name jesus in jesus name and do you know there's even a blessing when you bless your dinner did you know that you should end your blessing the bible says that when you do that when you bless god and you bless your food it says he will take sickness far from you you may not have ever read that scripture but you know i do remind god this is what your word says i i thank you for blessing my food to the nourishment of my body i thank you for the provision of it and that might be a good idea to do that now even if you don't have food thank him for it and asking to bless what is coming to you our own family experienced people we would give so much away our own family we'd even give our food away and then my dad would have a set the table and thank god for the food and i am not making this up people would show up at the door with food so don't limit yourself to what man thinks or man's ways not even your normal ways step outside your box and believe that god cares about you but yes this is good news chick-fil-a is still open it's all drive-through there's many few a few drive-throughs like i said they're different in every city so check in your city make sure you pray for your local government as well as the federal government pray for all them to hear god's plan to get witty ideas to use sound wisdom get them to step outside the box and make sure you bless ask god to bless them it says to bless those who are over you when you begin to do the things the bible says things are going to start happening for you so don't get moved by things you move things this is a kingdom age quote you don't get moved by things they don't get moved by this virus are you having to stay at home are you being quarantined make sure you move things by declaring and decreeing taking authority in the spirit realm over anything the enemy is trying to do against you those of you who already command an army from heaven and yes that is possible jesus did we can too he harkens they hearken unto the word of the lord he is the lord of hosts he sends them here and yes it is our privilege to send them to pull down strongholds they are our mighty weapons to put on strongholds against the enemy and i know jen is standing here with something in her hand if i'm talking even in a church or someplace my family have to get in front of me and jump up and down because i'm so focused like when i look at this camera i see you it isn't just a camera it is a portal to the whole world that is watching and when i bless you in the name of the lord you know what happens the host of heaven the army will carry blessings into every home that is right now connected to this facebook page right now whether you're watching it now or later i bless you in the name of the lord and your finances and your families and your food supply your creativity i bless you in jesus name because i really mean that and i'm gonna let jen say something to me what is it jen oh okay yes we will do we will add something else because you know there is somebody on the earth on the earth in this country especially working very hard for all of us even if you don't like him even if you don't understand him even if he's not perfect i will tell you this yes god chose trump and yes we here at one quest international that's my company and studio oq1 we are supporting our president not just in his decisions right now but in his reelection which god has assured me for all those wondering yes he is still god is still planning on him winning in 2020 and we have created this little uh video to support what he's doing letting you know we trust and that god has chosen him and believe in him so we're going to let you see our little promo for the trump 2020 race [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so well we're back i hope you enjoyed that and again as i said that we are going to support um president trump right now in the decisions you know they're not easy the decisions he has to make but he has such hope for this country and not just this country but for the people of this country and i know you hear me talk about america but you know what this is where i'm from this is my realm this is where god sent me to live i am aware that there are other countries out there even great countries that have done wonderful things for god you know i could start listing them and man then we go forever but i do want to say you know some of the greatest revivals we've had in the past many of them were actually in um in the uk and i can tell you they're the covenanters of scotland there was patrick and all the kings he won for jesus christ in ireland and then the welsh revival wow if you never read about that maybe in this time you should go back and and to study these things and maybe share something with your family because there were great people on the earth before we were here and we're going to be great for god because he wants us to be and then even when some of you go on to heaven there'll be more great people on the earth because god wants us to be great for him and with him and so i am grateful for president trump if you haven't decided i would encourage you to vote for him and nominate him you know in this new election in 2020 which will start a whole divine decade for us and while we're talking about your time right now at home this little break in time uh we're going to actually show some fun things because we like to laugh laughter is a medicine it's also a weapon because satan can't get to you when you are laughing so i hope they make you laugh here's something we've taken off of facebook and other people have made it's fun so here we go we're going to start watching some of them right now i hope it makes you laugh and we did enjoy every single one of these jen did her best to get some of the best ones and if you have opportunity to see them or even create some yourself that might be a good idea i think one of my favorite ones of course is this whole discussion about the toilet paper you know i do have some rolls i haven't counted them lately but um maybe you could count them and let us know how many you have and put it in your comments you know that might be fun for people to read oh i've got 10 you know i've got 100 if you've got 100 you better be sharing them with other people right and uh but people can be very fun and you know who gives that humor it's god and so i hope you laughed at those there's many many more out there um being shown and this is funny i love it when the pastors and this i'm just going to give rod parsley a you know a thumb two thumbs up rod that was a great little funny thing you did with the toilet paper with the tp and uh i think tp's taking on a whole new meaning right now during this time never have we had so much discussion about toilet paper and uh who would who would think that would be an item of interest right not just that of course paper towels come right in behind that and tissues and we go down that hole line and you can tell what the most important things are right when you go to the store what is missing the tp and even some of the suggestions that other people have of what we could use instead i haven't found one good suggestion okay i'm not adam and eve i'm not gonna go pluck leaves off the tree that's not gonna happen with me and so but i know people people love humor and sometimes that's a door that will open things for people to have discussions with you like my pink hair i might mention briefly about the pink hair i honestly i mind sitting here i cannot see the pink hair on my head and believe it or not sometimes i forget it's there but this was not my plan this is an example of god's plan right here this painter on my head and yes it does divide asunder the flesh from the spirit people who don't like it who bash it who say horrible things against it they're operating in the flesh the people think this is a great idea wow god is so creative look at that you know what the rainbow belongs to him why not have color on your head why not wear some of it on your head and so that's the spirit the walking in the spirit walking in the flesh and so god's bringing many new things to this earth hair color is one of them and i'm taking another little drink of my strength that my man ran up and got for me because you know i've been talking a lot i'll be talking a whole lot more and so why not put fun in your life and i remember years ago when the holy spirit told me yes fun is a medicine laughter is a medicine the word says it is but he said to me while i'm at a platform i can't remember where it was might have been up north somewhere he said did you know that in this time that laughter is actually a weapon fun is a weapon i mentioned that a minute ago why is it a weapon satan will put all kinds of thoughts in your head and the word says take every thought captive that takes itself above the plans of the life of god that means anything that is not good anything that does not bring life or hope or fun creativity or you know to inspire you encourage you it says to take those thoughts captive that means don't let them keep running through your mind if you've got bad thoughts running from you through your mind guess who sent them it was hell right not heaven heaven wants life for us and life more abundantly for us so you need to realize what is running to your mind what are your thoughts saying what you think about enough is what you will do and that's what my husband says also you will do what you will to do and your will is affected by the things you read the things you watch and get this even the things you say will affect the way you live your life so make sure you are laughing that you make others laugh especially in this day it really makes the enemy very unhappy i will give you a list of things that satan hates he hates people who love especially when they're not being loved back he hates it when we're kind to one another right he hates it when we laugh he hates it when we learn to celebrate he hates it when we realize that he is the one causing all the grief all the hate he comes to kill steal and destroy that's going on in your life that comes from one place and they don't get any thumbs up they get thumbs down there's two thumbs down for help right and while you're doing your dinner blessing why not ask for triple trouble in hell you'd be amazed what you could ask for and god will actually do it and so i just want you to realize there's a real devil i have been to heaven i have been to hell you want to choose heaven hell is not a place it's not going to be r r there's no parties in hell no food in hell no rest in hell that does not exist there's torture plenty of it non-going ongoing torture that is what is there don't side with the enemy don't help him advertise negative things hateful things mean things don't repeat things that are going on with your friends and especially don't repeat negative things about your family if you're going to stand for their salvation you need to make a stand the bible says stand and stand there for that means you declare that there will become a a living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ you declare that they will not miss the destiny god has planned for them you declare that they will know christ and serve him all of their life those are powerful piercing words in the spirit realm and yes it does do something for your loved ones as well because you're making a stand for them even if they're not nice to you and i know that happens okay they're not nice they hate you they don't want to talk to you all that comes from what and the enemy is doing with their lives so why not make a stand and don't change the stand in other words don't be double-minded if you're saying something powerful god will do don't turn around and say the opposite you don't want to wipe out what you just prayed and i can tell right now in this time you need to be declaring that this is the time for celebration for expectation a time for god to propel you on your path that it says we go from glory to glory do you know that's an upward motion i want to go from glory to glory to glory i don't want to go from glory to the pit and fall into despair and fear glory to the pit where are you going you are going nowhere so kick out of your life choose what you will to lose from your soul any fear any anger any any uh deception any confusion all that stuff comes from the enemy you bind to your soul because i will say this one of the things we will be learning about over these this next week or so is the keys to the kingdom and how that opens up there's my key right there how the keys to the kingdom will open up things in your life you never had before and it will eliminate things you don't want your life that you have not wanted for a very long time but keep coming back and bombarding you or tormenting you you can use the keys of the kingdom to get rid of them an artist friend of mine did a painting and sent it to me which is so beautiful it shows a person with a key about to put it in a keyhole and inside this whole keyhole you see heaven what are they doing when you use the keys of the kingdom you are unlocking heaven to operate in your life so i know a lot of revelation but right now we have decided and god has asked us to do this broadcast mainly to let you know that this is not the time that he's wrapping everything up this is not the time for the tribulation and as the holy spirit says the four horses of the apocalypse are still in the barn and you know what the nephilim are not roaming the earth right now coming to knock on your door and drag you out in the streets uh the antichrist this is truth the antichrist and you can say i believe it or not the antichrist the antichrist spirit is on the earth because that's satan and the antichrist spirit is anything that is against god that would be like a false religion that's an antichrist spirit anyone who is against christ himself and speaks against him trying to say he is not the son of god that none of that stuff is true in the bible that is an antichrist spirit the antichrist spirit is on the earth but the antichrist himself and there's even some people to say he's not going to be here either they are mistaken at one time generations down god's timeline those things he said in his word they will happen he has a purpose for them happening even when we don't understand them but you're in a blessed time to be alive on this earth you are not living in the time of the tribulation or the perilous times or the antichrist who will actually embody a person it's just satan embodying a person that's what that is the antichrist is not on the earth he and what he will do is not on this earth right now because the word says until he until he is removed that withholds the antichrist can't come guess who that he is it's us the body of christ ruling and reigning with christ the manifested sons and daughters speaking to the lamb the sea and the air commanding things to happen with jesus christ and they happen if they were all still here the antichrist would not be effective people wouldn't even receive him it wouldn't be the tribulation time because this time of the manifested sons and daughters on the earth things will be great things will be healed things will be better we're living in the time okay god's time right now is for us to be great for him to take the knowledge of the glory that's not just a saying that is an action the glory of god coming from you is like it's like something begins to just go and waves from you and it will remove the enemy in people's lives it will invade their life their very person with the presence of god it's like a cosmic shock wave like if i have my staff right now and i just hit it on the ground wherever i declare things from god and i hit my staff which is always out with me at three in the morning as i'm declaring the things of god i see in the spirit a shock wave of the fire of god going that's what the glory will do you will take that around this world and that hasn't even begun to happen yet so we're not living in the perilous times we're living in the great times of god the times and all those things would begin to happen he talked about be excited you're alive be excited you have children yes it's a good idea to get married and have children they'll be greater than you will look forward to your children doing greater things and being greater for christ than even you this is just the beginning of a time on the earth that's never existed so this is not the very end he is not going to wrap it all up and roll this earth away when he hasn't even begun to do the things he himself declared would happen look forward to celebrating with you i look forward to sharing with you that god is about great things he's behind the scenes of everything on this earth right now even leaders it's a time of being shifted god is shifting the leaders of governments so he can then shape their nation and that's what's happening in our country right now no matter what you think of it or how you look at it the virus thing that gets attached and now it'll be gone okay i hope you'll be greater and more powerful in god and like i said give your family a lot of love because one day you'll be out there back to work again maybe you'll even have your own business look forward to the great things of god trust him to do the things and thank him for the things he's bringing to your life and so father we all declare together let's declare this together everybody watching make sure y'all do it [Music] say father father as a child of god as a child of god i make a declaration i make a declaration that this virus this virus is passing quickly it's passing quickly so your time so your time can be done in the earth can be done on the earth and that is what will be established and that is what will be established we all ask for we all ask for and receive and receive and want to walk in and want to walk in your will your will your way your way we invite heaven we invite him and push back the darkness in our life and push back the darkness because we serve you because we serve you and you alone and you alone we pray for our presidents we pray for our presence and all those under

and decree in your word and so as she decrees your word lord we ask we honor her as a prophetess we honor her as a as your as your oracle but lord we thank you lord as she speaks we ask that you would bless her so much you would bless her you would overcome her with blessings overcome her family with blessings that you would bless them in everything that they set their hand to and lord we thank you now as we just honor cat as she comes in jesus name amen amen come let us have it sister [Music] good morning this is early for me for those of you who don't know me i i go to sleep around 6 30 or 7 now it used to be four but now i'm up even later so uh i'm i'm so glad to be here you know because i get stretched in this time and yet some of the most powerful things come out of me in this time and so i i can promise you first of all i'm going to share what was going on in the spirit realm while all this worship is going on you have some new hosts that are posted here as sentinels and uh i used to call them well well they look like native americans but no they've always looked like that there's whole tribes of angels that look like that that wear garments like that with the symbols you know and the way that that came into this world was god has always had seers and some of the first nations were seers and so they took some of those images that they've seen on these beings and they put them on their garments they put them on their on their tents their homes uh many of the things you buy that are called southwest images are actually images from the throne room and he has some pretty wild drummers up there and they were here today and there were two new ones i had not seen they weren't even here yesterday they're about 70 foot tall they had fallout headdress on them they had pelts with living eyes the feathers had living eyes every feather in the headdress they were like blue eyes all over them and their garments just shown with the glory and there's one right there and there's one right there and they were dancing the whole time we were dancing and i could hear that drum i love the drum drum sound from the throne room um when that is played and they were playing somewhere outside playing there were those two main ones but there are others and then some came in and were dancing on this platform and i recently saw the same ones in reno nevada on the platform and they're angels of freedom they were they were doing a freedom dance here and uh freedom is coming from everything at the enemy in golden in denver colorado [Applause] and if you've ever seen some of the the first nations or the native americans dance when they do that thing where they're like this they were up here there were two of them and they're like dressed in blue they have blue feathers going at the very top of their head right up here and there have eyes in those feathers and all the feathers coming off of their wings have eyes and when i saw them in reno i asked the lord what are they and he goes those are freedom dancers bringing freedom to the area so i i can tell you also that god is taking las vegas and reno as regions of as regions of glory this will be a region of glory where crime or sickness where disease cannot exist so i was i was so excited when i saw them here today and went so i knew who they were i knew what they were and i could tell you the men that were dancing you were dancing with them up here on the platform and the glory was just rolling off of them as they were dancing the glory and so freedom and liberty is coming uh tour land two to colorado to nevada god is taking those regions all right so your lives will not be the same and even after this weekend you cannot remain the same because when you have stepped into and receive what god is offering in this time you can't miss or escape receiving it you're going to get it because you said yes everyone yell yes now look look up and so say i say yes [Applause] and so uh well i'll try to speak if i can but they they're really outside right now looking in there are they are huge beings and in in their chest they have these strips of like it looks like gold metal to me it's probably real gold i'm sure it is and in them and all these metal pieces are shaped like that and they have living eyes in them in the front in the back to see anything of the enemy that comes against this ministry against your people these beings will drive them off and deal harshly with [Applause] them yes yeah just like the things of the enemy are drawn where there's evil where there's darkness where there's hate where there's violence and i know a lot of people think well i won't go watch movies that have immorality in or defiling language but violence is just as bad it is and i want to remind you that one of the accusations the father had against lucifer was you have filled yourself with violence so be aware when you go to watch something make sure it's not graphic sadistic torturing violence because that will go in your soul you don't want it in there amen we're about life not death watch things that give life they bring celebration in your life they're going to help your soul to prosper there is a promise for divine help there really is even as your soul prospers you will prosper in be in hell that is a state of existence coming to the body of christ who will let their soul prosper so we need to keep the darkness out the violence out anything defiling keep it out you have to guard that innermost part of your being the very heart of your being is where your soul is that's why it was so important when god said adam became a living soul we are not just people we're not just a spirit we're the with a body people go well we have a soul no you are a soul according to the father you are a living soul it's one of the main parts of you you can't leave that out of your life you can't remain ignorant of your soul because it's what you think on what you choose and then what you do i would say that was you yeah so more and more in this time we must be aware of of our soul and what we're letting in there as a man think us in that place so is he out of your soul will flow the way you live your life the issues of life out of it before the issues of life that means the way you will live your life that's what the father told me and so the soul is very key in your life even in your children's lives what you put in their soul growing up it's going to help them become who god wants them to become you're not just raising a child not even the next generation you are shaping souls in your life every day you're shaping your own soul your soul gets fed 24 hours a day whatever's going around you whatever you're whatever you're seeing watching saying or hearing it goes in there it goes in there a lot of meetings but i get excited i had to almost sit on myself to not start screaming [Applause] i've heard that around the throne i have been there and i've heard it it is stunning you will get so undone by the glory over the throne and the seraphim who come down and dip out of there they're so full of the fire they are on fire they sing some of the most beautiful song they will dip down over the throne and go back up and dip down over the throne and go back up yeah satan didn't get any of them even in heaven they choose how much of a relationship they want it was obvious and you would think the ones who were created for worship would not have been deceived but they were the very ones because they followed they began to follow the one who led them not the one who made them if they were deceived by the enemy deception is still it is an anti-christ spirit and even then it was it was even jesus said it was then it was there even then it was there and so i think one of the most one of the most number one weapons the enemy uses today when he realizes because of our relationship our intimacy with god when he realizes he's not going to get us to just outright sin then he will try to bring us into into deception or distraction because we need to stay on that path we are running after him and no matter what i talk about about the encounters that i i've had or what i've seen or the revelation he's given me still the number one thing in my life is to pursue him to be passionate about him to desire his heart his ways his words his presence it feeds me i eat less and less because i eat of him there's a whole revelation about eat my flesh and drink my blood that is total consumption of who he is you are totally consuming all of him all of what he did i love to talk about the blood of christ i was caught up to heaven take him back in time and i saw him pouring out his blood on the mercy seat so many encounters but nothing more powerful than knowing the love of christ to know him to know not just know about him but to know him and he said that if you pursue him with all of your heart you will find him and when you find him you will want to be just like him it says when we see him we will no longer know in part or understand in part it says now we see darkly like through a glass we see in part we know in part but when you see him you will no longer know in part that means you will know details that means you will know his heart his ways have his thoughts so don't ever stop doing that no matter what you go after in your life don't ever leave him out i have written in the front of my bible don't ever let me get to a place where i do not need you [Music] in the past god would do things to make sure that people weren't elevated above because of the revelation that they got you know even in paul that thorn of flesh he got was blindness it would come and go it would attack him and go attack him and go and a lot of people don't know what that is they they try to figure it out but it's in the word because paul said the first time i came to you you wanted to give me everything if possible you would have plucked out your very eyes and given them to me why would he have said that why did he need to scribe all the time because it was hard for him to see to write so whenever he penned a letter that said i have penned this with my own hand you need to go back and read those because he was so fierce about having this given to them and them living a right life a powerful life he would write that himself even with that on him now i can tell you that he stopped asking for that to be removed when christ said my grace is sufficient my grace is sufficient for the evil for for the day for the evil thereof and that was grace for abundant life christ was talking about christ never came to put sickness disease infirmities he never brought poverty with him he didn't bring fear with him he didn't bring hopelessness or unworthiness he didn't bring any of those he came to bring light and life more abundantly and we need to walk on that today now not just when you go to heaven [Music] in the past people died to move to heaven to walk in a certain way on in their life they were free from everything creative inventive in heaven adventure excitement fun no fear no hate no deception no distractions filled with the light and the glory of god but in this time on the earth we have a commission to live a whole new way so what you've been hearing me talk about is not just some nice things to make you feel good it is so you can have a new lifestyle to live on earth as they do in heaven that's not going to be a normal life it's going to be the most amazing life you have ever lived in this world and god wants it wants it seen openly and visibly in our lives the goodness of god overwhelming us flowing off of us wherever we go the creativity of god we are supposed to be creators like our father say amen let us make man in our image what is your image he's a creator what is christ's image a commander they rule there's no higher level anywhere in existence than the the triune godhead and yet how awesome is that that he said that statement in genesis let us make man in our image and after our likeness that word likeness means operate like we do we are joint ears with christ he walked in so much and we're living so far below that but in this day because of revelation this is what revelation is it comes from the heart of the father it does not come from the mind of man so it will not sound normal to you it won't even make sense to you sometimes it seems absolutely impossible but with god nothing is impossible all things through christ are possible so we need to understand and realize what did christ give us when he came here what was he on this earth walking as a righteous man he had power and authority over the storms he multiplied the food he raised the dead all the time he never blinked at one demon not one demon was he afraid of where he went they were tormented he could shift time and step in the spirit realm and walk through people he didn't walk around those crowds he walked through them because the spirit realm supersedes this natural realm that's why angelic means can walk through the walls so christ did all these amazing powerful things and then he says the things i did you will do and greater things than he did we will do we're still trying to figure out the things he did you're not getting anything without faith you're not ever going to get to a point where you don't need faith to do things you have to start trusting god and telling him you trust him he wants you to say something he loves it when you make declarations he gets up off the throne and he shouts when he sees people on the earth with faith christ didn't say when i come will i see power will i see dominion will i see creativity will i see souls being saved no we didn't say they said well i see faith and so many people they just want things but they don't even use their faith you go from glory to glory because of your faith your faith can grow when you when you hit a certain level your faith just gets accelerated where no matter what he has said no matter what that word says you live it like it's truth we all have measures but did you realize that a measure means it can be increased [Applause] if you pour something in a measuring cup can you add more and you can get a bigger cup until it's pouring over isn't that what it says overflowing if you get to a place in him i want everybody to say this christ operated without measure on this earth [Music] his dream and his purpose is for us to get to that place in him where we also operate without measure i know what i'm talking about because i was uh in law i i worked in law that was a god thing told totally let me tell you they hired me with no experience because i was anointed with favor and literally i was hired because of the favor not because of my typing skills trust me you type 40 words a minute no one's going to want you in the natural but i was taught i was hired and i was taught by the lawyers how to do real estate law estate planning business law i learned all kinds of these different levels of the different law and the legal system one thing i really got was in a probate in a state i totally knew what it meant when it said you were a joint heir if you're an heir to somebody even like in england the heir to the throne no one can say you can't have that it's written as law in those countries so guess what was written in heaven as law that there was a last will and testament called the new testament that the the names of these books aren't just put there because they sound good every one of those names means something like revelations someone tell me there's nowhere in the bible that talks about revelations i said god calls me a revelator i'm here to reveal heaven i'm here to reveal the spirit realm i'm here here to reveal the true authority of the believer the dominion and authority of the believer and they go there's no such thing as a revelator i think john was one a revelator simply means you reveal the things of god and what do you think revelations were those were the revelations john re received and shared things never heard of before things that were hard to comprehend you think the book of revelations is easy to understand it's because it came from the heart of god and he reveals himself all the time even john the baptist gave some of the most shocking revelations of all time he was totally shifting the way that those who believed in god were going to live hey they knew you had to go to temple and make sacrifices and once a year your sins were forgiven and here was this wild man wearing camel hair turned inside out lived in the wilderness he looked like a wild man ate locust and honey was his diet pizza and chocolate ice cream is a whole lot better and so is pink hair pizza there's pizza in heaven yes i do like it but i like thin crusts not that zero calories yes and zero calories in heaven it's one of the reasons why they call it heaven but it's the place where things have never been heard of or seen or even understood but god has prepared for those that love him but i love the next part of that scripture unless and accept it be revealed by his spirit so that shows you the things of god can be revealed there are mysteries in the word and the first time you hear them you'll be shocked that they were there all along but you didn't see them because they were a mystery but god loves to share them with his children so be more like a child laugh a lot more dream imagine the impossible there's places telling you not to even do that anymore and yet let me tell you if you're an artist if you don't imagine things you can't you can't produce or create that god puts that in us to be creators uh like an inventor that's still a creator right inventions witty ideas we're creators you should be creating something all the time you should be doing something new all the time you should be new all the time i heard the father yell tell them to be new do something new go someplace new think of something new say something new don't remain the same old same-o that's right yeah don't be boring see this world needs to see this they need to hear this they need to know that you can live without fear when you belong to jesus christ because you do have power over all the power of the enemy that we can crush the plans of darkness that we can have none of him in us [Music] and be dangerous [Applause] i love the whole army thing yeah heaven has an army strange weird fierce unshakable unstoppable created by the hand of god himself to defeat that army of darkness but they were never created to guard heaven that army didn't even kick out satan the father did the father did he didn't even get off the throne went up there shaking in heaven he wasn't shaken in heaven but lucifer was going around tempting all of them he knew he would lose but he was going to let others see who really was worshiping him who really had given herself to what they were created for we replace all the angels that worship before the throne so you go before the throne every single time you worship that's how he inhabits the praises of his people you're connecting with heaven every single time you worship so when you hear about heaven it should be something oh yes i was going to tell you what else i saw right before the trumpet blew i heard the lord say that calvary is coming i was really having fun in this service because i was seeing um heaven here and what they were doing then i saw the people connecting the worship connecting the dancing connecting that they were all hearing what heaven was saying and singing so they played it and the dancers were actually impressed by what the angels were dancing up here they were doing the same thing yeah and even the ones outside and the drummers that were lightning bolts were shooting off of those drums [Applause] and and i would get so undone i had to sit down so i wouldn't fall down because the glory was so thick in here and they would dance and dance then he would turn and look in the window to watch you dance and worship and flag and shout [Music] [Applause] [Music] every congregation needs a seer because you get so excited to really see you are a part of what heaven is doing that's right because every time you shout it whenever you shouted they shouted in the throne room every time you shouted something the throne room shouted it [Applause] and the father would sit there and he would laugh and laughter he threw his head back because there are those who worship in spirit and truth on the earth and every time we do it it pierces the enemy and every time we do it there's the father began to laugh and it goes like dominoes around all of heaven it just starts like a wave of people laughing and laughing and laughing because there's a people who worship in spirit and truth the enemy doesn't want anyone to worship anything but him and you you know he stole the glory that's what he did he wanted to be the glory and have the glory and he wanted all of it even when he was in heaven that was a bad decision bad decision so we get to carry the glory produce the glory and carry the glory around this world for him and is going to undo this world they will be undone i've seen some of that happening and i know it will it will cause thousands to run into the kingdom because they know what kind of life they've been living they know what darkness is everything darkness has marked everything it's left its mark in the movies in books and children's toys in apparel it's just marked everywhere it's about to be wiped out because heaven's going to put its mark on everything [Applause] you'll be able to buy home decor things to decorate your home with rugs things to put on your windows even the furniture will have symbols and images of heaven on it and you are past it'll speak because god is going to put his anointing on it it's one of the ways the glory will invade this earth that's one of the reasons why heaven is invading this earth you'll sit on your amazing self of this anointed and you'll just hear sounds from heaven your walls will release frequencies from heaven in them you've already created when you create an atmosphere for heaven to inhabit your home and it will if they see the life of god they see worship they see honor being given to the name of the lord jesus they cannot escape they cannot they want to be and know your lives they're watching your lives they've all been watching your lives and they're cheering you on they are heaven is very much aware of what's going on this earth your own family members are up there cheering you on run your race don't get off the track this is an accelerated time the race will be greater the impact on the earth will be greater the glory will be greater the revelation will be greater the creativity will be greater the blessings and the and the wealth will be greater than ever before what we build for god on the earth in the spirit and then the physical is about to be accelerated because this is god's time for that to happen so when you step into what he wants you can't escape being blessed you're not going to escape he used to say that to me other times you are not going to escape when you say you're going to go say this and you will not escape doing it okay no matter what they think no matter where it is or what it is i'm saying it and i'll say it as loud and as boldly and as often as you want to you want me to i laid down my life died to myself and i live in christ and the devil can't impact a dead person he can't tempt a dead person he can't put fear in them if there's none of him in you he can't do anything to you amen jesus said i give you power over all the power of the enemy to tread upon so i can't even say it serpents and scorpions tread upon them and nothing by any means shall harm you we're living in those days in this new time we are living in those days that our life will be different because we will be living on earth as they do in heaven if you heard me talk you know a lot about heaven you should know a lot about heaven because god is bringing revelation on purpose why is he showing us heaven why do we need to know how it operates what is life like there what goes on what places does he have what do they get to do you need to know that because we're going to live like that down here oh yeah they worship it's called living worship not just in the throne room bowing down sometimes everybody just jumps up and down for fun [Applause] yes it's holy but it is fun some people think why should i even go to heaven it's going to be so boring no you've lived boring down here because they have the greatest adventures in heaven god wouldn't have said you must be like little children to enter into the kingdom of he'd be in big trouble if we all got up there and we were like you know old minded with all the fun stuff he's made but he knows when you come there that's how you feel because you're free of any cares any concerns you're not always warring just to to stay safe and pay your rent everyone up there pays for nothing god has already made a provision and supplied your mansion's built before you ever get there and everything you want love or need is already there but god has a sense of humor the number one thing before besides going in the throne room people love to do is take tours of heaven and they have tour guide angels that has a cap that says tour guide and they have a money changer belt you know the little things that go push click click click and the coins come out nobody has money in heaven they do it for humor and and and you'll get there for the first time they'll they already know who the new people are because they're like this and then walked up one of these tour guide angels and they go um do you have your pass [Laughter] on purpose and you hear people all around they're giggling because they know you don't need a pass however the real characters go his name is jesus christ so if you've got one in your family this probably will be the response some of the others are like we need a pass who gave out the passes and people laugh i mean they will laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh there's no past required and you're not going to give anybody money to go anywhere [Applause] you can step on a road of light and just go yourself and everybody talks about the humor of god but but when you really experience it you realize how funny he can be and his goodness people live in his goodness about a year ago he started saying start declaring the goodness of god over your family your friends especially your enemies there's almost nothing more fun than blessing those who are cursing you as a seer especially it's a lot of fun because i see the demons controlling the people who are blasting me and i'm blessing them and those demons are going stop [Music] they're screaming it's like arrows piercing them because i'm giving them life which cancels out the death that's why he said bless those right who curse you pray for those who despitefully it's powerful blessing is a weapon joy and celebration is a weapon fun is a weapon they laugh all the time in heaven they have amazing adventures there's so many places to go and visit in heaven valley of the falls passionate paradise techno city cartoon village jello land the friendly forest the sky mansions valley i always say valley falls i love that place the mountain of spices that they mention in the word really exist in heaven the all the aromas of thanksgiving and fall the leaves are like this big and they're the most beautiful uh every kind of color you can imagine if you love the fall your mansion will probably be in the mountain spices i mean from burgundies to literal gold and all those shades in between the deep vibrant oranges and some are even blue these trees are like 200 foot tall and you can hike as far as you want and never get tired [Music] if you like to backpack on horses the horses will be it will be their pleasure to take you and they will have conversations with you all the way up they'll even show you some of the best places to go and see a tour guide without the cap oh yeah the hunting is in heaven is something else people say nothing dies oh no nothing dies [Laughter] you have photo shoots you capture what you're hunting by photo you have a scope camera i'm serious about all this uh somebody well known i don't ever mention their name but i always tell the story it's amazing one of the encounters i had a young man had ended his suffering and a lot of people were telling this uh prophet that it was too bad that his son was in hell when he had served god his whole life the people in the world weren't saying that we are so sorry that you have lost your son we know you loved him we know how we would feel so you know we we are having compassion for you we really are caring about you and we'll pray even people who don't pray will tell people we'll pray that's the world saying that most of the body was saying they're burning in hell and that was the first time god taught me about the difference between suicide and ending your life and ending your suffering he said when you're not in your right mind control of emotion whether it's emotional physical or mental you're not in control of your own emotions you're not you cannot think clearly or make decisions you just know you cannot suffer any longer so you end your suffering and he said those people go to heaven he made me go to the dictionary which he does many times uh he has me gives me scriptures in the word but he also says to go look in the dictionary to see what man says about it he said go look up the word suicide and it says willingly knowingly intelligently taking your own life he said but what most people are experiencing that's not that's not what they're doing okay a suicide bomber or a terrorist that is real suicide they know that their life will end and they purposely go do it because they know usually to bring violence or hurt to someone else to make others suffer is usually what suicide is about so these these bombers are coming bomb strapped on them they're intelligently making this decision oh yeah i'm willing to do this to take the lives of others they committed suicide but people who either through accidents or mental stress or emotional uh when they get to despair when you reach despair it's like sickness that they can't handle any longer so they're ending their suffering it's not that they don't love you it's not that they don't want to live anymore they can't stand the suffering and i literally was caught up to heaven and told that and the father said you will tell people about that and i had people say don't say that how can you say that i went would you like to go stand before the living god and have him explain what this means and then you say i'm not going to say it and they go well maybe not and he said this is going to help relieve the pain and agony that people have been put through with the loss of their loved ones who no longer had any control over their minds or their thoughts or their will and he said those people i would be unjust and unrighteous especially if they knew me i would be unjust and unrighteous just to give them to the enemy who actually destroyed them and he said you let them know they're in heaven they're with me and so he actually did this because of that young man because of what happened to him and what people were saying to this this prophet god said i'm going to show you where his son is this person was visiting our church i was doing hospitality for him when he came and i actually had bought all the stuff to put the food together and in the parking lot of my church she caught me up to heaven and i saw this miss this man's son i think he was probably in his 20s and i didn't know anything about him and i saw him standing in his father's mansion that was still being built and there was a trophy on this mantle that said satan zero god won and that was because satan didn't get his son and he said you're gonna go tell him that his son is with me in heaven and then i and this went on for a while he caught me up a second time he said i'm going to show you what he's now doing now and i saw him putting equipment on on this horse he was going to go backpacking and up a trail ride up the mountain spices and i saw this at the foothills was this huge mansion that he had come out of that i knew was his father's mansion and so it was this beautiful amazing place all made out of stone living stones not just stone there's nothing normal or plain in heaven there were this whole place was built with living stones and so i saw his son and he was talking i can't wait for my dad to get here one day man he's going to be so excited to find out there's some other way to hunt animals this is going to be exciting this is his first time going up there by the way i'm sure he had some other thoughts about that but but he that's what he was doing us i put camera equipment on the stuff on this this beautiful horse there was another horse with some other stuff on it so if you want to camp you can still camp in the mountain of spices without fear of anything attacking you or getting lost because you can't get lost anywhere in heaven you're in heaven so this is where he was going he was going on a hunt he was going on a hunt and i saw him the whole time see they talk about you all the time in heaven they talk about all the fun things you did the things you love to do together you still get to do those things in heaven and so he was excited about his siblings and his father knowing about this this hunting trip he was going on and so he's starting up the mountain of spices and i see these creatures almost transparent peeking around some of the trees and they had a scope camera well he was hunting now they were hunting him [Applause] and the father said hunting will take on a whole new meaning so that's how i learned about that that they do that in heaven and so i saw him i'm doing i started doing other things i saw him another time in his mother's mansion which is right next to his father's mansion and on the walls of that mansion i saw siblings that hadn't even been born yet i saw family pictures of the i knew who the father was i recognized the father i didn't haven't really seen his wife anywhere and you know when he traveled or whatever but i saw the father the mother i saw him i saw another sibling and i saw others that hadn't ever been born yet god knows who he's going to send and while this is this is exciting i know how many more she's going to have and so you have precious things captured memories and things put in your mansion so if you ever wanted to take a photo and you missed it and said man i wish i had taken it the angels take it they print it they frame it and they put it in your mansion [Applause] and i had to give up that gift to do this that was my gift i am a photographer so he used a business person to do all this i'm the ceo of a company he used a business person to reveal this stuff he likes business people they think clearly they're not afraid to make plans for the future they they make sure that they line on everything to see what they need and that it gets done they make sure the people they hire have the gifts and the things that they need they have strategies they have excitement they have creativity they don't mind connecting and contacting with other people no matter what they believe they're not afraid to go talk to people so business people like his son master carpenter and paul the tent maker and luke the physician all them they were in business so you need to be in business i'm serious god in this day will have more entrepreneurs in the body of christ than in the world or you'll be a part of a business or company that's headed up by somebody like that it's coming and so i saw the stuff going on and so i went and wrote everything down i saw and heard i typed it and i brought it typed when he came to speak now i didn't get to hear him speak because i was in the kitchen i was hospitality and i was preparing all his meals and decorating the room he would eat in and i went up to my my pastor and i said um this is what got my pastor knew i was going to heaven all the time and i said oh i said this is what i saw and he said you need to give this to him they need this word desperately it changed their life forever because number one they didn't believe what anyone else was saying about their son being in hell because not only i did not know this but they actually lived their actual home is in the mountains and the thing that they did the most together was hunting now i didn't know that about them at all and so god already see that's this is the evidence he gives that their loved ones are doing things as they always did down here and i didn't know any of this so this is what they knew that i had seen their son and the wife was so healed she wouldn't even go out in public anymore because of the accusations and i want you know what the body of christ needs to stop doing that no matter what happened or how it happened you need to have compassion on those people because if it happened to you you would want compassion given to you amen so yes there's all kinds of fun amazing things to do in heaven and they are never bored they are filled with the light and the love of god they're excited about us about us who are on this earth right now because this is our time to shine like the stars in the heaven where even when we go outside at one point the night will be like light about us the word says that we're that generation that will experience that i know that the word says there will be a generation which is a group and type of people that will be on the earth that will taste of the powers of the age to come the next age after this age is the millennial age and the powers that will be present then for the people is that they will live to be hundreds and hundreds of years old christ will be sitting on the throne his life will permeate the entire earth just like back in the ancient days in the old testament days you know they lived to be five six seven hundred years old so when christ sitting on the throne it will begin to change the earth heal the earth there will be many millions of natural people on the earth that didn't take the mark of the beast nor did they die in the tribulation and people will still have children in that time in heaven you don't have children but if you never had one god has a place in heaven called the reserve of babies if you never had one you can go pick one out it'll be you will be its mother its father you can see it grow step into its destiny its true destiny is to use the gift god your ultimate destiny for everyone sitting here not necessarily what you do for a job aren't you glad it is the gift he made you to be so even when children go home to heaven they will not miss their destiny their destiny has not been stolen from them because their ultimate destiny is to grow up and be the gift he put in them their gifts are their gifts and callings are irrevocable and they will step into that and use that in heaven so if you're if you're one of those who's lost a baby or lost a child or a youth don't sit there and think that their whole life was taken away from them they're living in the most glorious place having the most fun they've ever had with friends going all over heaven without parental guidance isn't that the best of the best going places doing things with jesus he has all of your children he has all of your babies they're filled with life they laugh they play even they get to create things the greatest levels of creativity and technology are in heaven and some of those technologies that i saw in heaven are literally going to be in this earth because this is the time for heaven to invade the earth people are saying things they don't understand how powerful that is what they're saying heaven is coming to earth heaven is invading the earth do we say that on earth as it is in heaven is one of the most profound statements anyone is making because that's a lifestyle it's a culture it's not just sounding good your will being done on earth as is in heaven is a culture it's a way of life called heaven culture so we who are alive now get to live in a way never lived before because this is the time where we will manifest demonstrate speak to the earth the sky the sea it'll be healed because of the glory we carry we'll step into time and go forward in time we'll see things forward in time we won't be bound by time or space because christ wasn't and everything i say will point right back to him the things he did we will do but you have to get your head get your head and put it on the shelf and open your spirit realize he said greater than so he actually saved the best for us to do so get off your rapturog roll it up and stick it in the closet the holy spirit laughs every time i say that because that's the first place i heard i heard him say it to me when i was saying were people trying to figure out and figure out in their natural mind everything that was being said i said you don't get revelation that way your spirit receives the things of the spirit so if you're if you're sitting there trying to figure out the first one you missed all the rest of them revelation is sent by god and there's different revelations he sends for certain times on the earth so you're hearing new things you've never heard about before or it wouldn't be revelation so i'm not going to be normal i'm not going to look normal i'm not going to say normal things that would be the same oh samo and god's not old he is new all the time so if you're going to hear about heaven it should be things you never thought of or heard of before but not just in heaven but on this earth the greater works he's not coming to rescue people and take them out here we haven't even done the greater works we're still trying to do the first works so god has given revelation on many things that we know are in the word but we don't necessarily have understanding so he's revealing mysteries i love his mysteries when he gives me one i get someone done like a little kid why didn't i see that why didn't i think of it that way why didn't i see it that way and he said because your thoughts aren't my thoughts but you can have my thoughts and you need to walk in my ways i didn't realize how many times it said that in the word even in the old testament he was telling people you need to walk in my ways you need to know my ways because they're not man's ways his are different they're unusual they're amazing fantastic life-changing they'll get you undone just like isaiah got undone i know how he felt when he had that experience you have no words to even say anything about it when you stand before him when you see that throne you see the living creatures massive and huge with thousands of eyes in their body and in their wings worshiping them continually the throne room is round the throne goes up like this like a pyramid with different levels and the throne is at the top that's why satan stole that image yeah almost everything he's told anything he says is his he stole it that throne goes up like levels and there's columns and levels and columns and levels but all goes like this and the throne is high and lifted up and there's four sets of steps that go up to the throne people are all over them gifts are all over them for the lord and for the father just gifts thrown up the steps the river of life flowing down these steps people are laying at the bottom drinking it sometimes he floods the throne room with it and you're swimming in it sometimes he opens the throne room floor and you literally see the river of life that goes down the streets of gold and then people jump in it it's a structure there's rooms under the throne that are under the altar where the souls go in there and they're under the altar crying out and we've always pictured them like here's the altar you know i know what altars look like and i've always pictured people crammed underneath these altars like how many can you fit because it says they cry out under the altar but that's because the altar is up here by his throne and there's rooms that you go into under the throne and even people go in there to clear over their families and people go in there and they they declare they worship they they say things over their families they bless their families but there's people in there always crying out for justice and if you ever walked up the steps of the throne they're very high very wide i clearly can so clearly embedded in my mind is the word justice like this big it's one of the steps of the throne justice is one of the biggest things we're going to get in this time as the body of christ justice against what the devil has done to us for generations and generations and generations [Music] to unseat him from where he put himself the righteous have learned he has no right to be there we were given dominion in the earth he was not he took it christ won it back for us so we're supposed to be like him we're supposed to be different we're supposed to be powerful we should be fierce against the darkness because the violent take it by force not the lazy not the ignorant not the ones who don't care the violent from the time of john the baptist that wild man who was shouting in the wilderness repent of your sins you wicked people the kingdom of heaven is a hand repent and get baptized in water do you know how weird that was you talk about bizarre at least i don't wear camel hair [Laughter] what time what oh no but my husband has threatened to buy me a camel costume so every time someone says god does not use pink hair i show up with the camel okay would you rather see this or the pink hair i've had many pastors say god does not do things like that he wouldn't do that you know you need to know him more because i know what the word says and at least he's not trying to tell me to walk around naked for two years sleep on one side turn it over sleep and cook my food on dung pink hair is a lot better and you know what they can't fight against the word i think john wore camel here is that correct well that was for that time no and that way god never changes he always does weird things to his prophets because he doesn't hide them he makes sure you don't ever forget them this is a marketing ploy for heaven right here and it works i get people saved on the plane in the airport security check-in tsa i get favor all the time in the airport because i declare i do people even the security people walking through the airport recognize me now they'll walk past me really quiet and they'll just kind of edge me over like they're going to interrogate me or something they do they come up with their badges and everything they get me over where no one kisses them they go so what is god showing you from heaven and then they'll just walk with me wherever i'm going they're walking me so uh it's okay um and they'll say i know you're busy and i know you got a plane to catch so you can just talk to me while we're walking while we're walking it's quite fun because they recognize the pink hair you can't hide one day this will be normal because heaven's invading earth and everyone in heaven at one time or another has highlights in their hair if they have a big celebration in the throne room everybody puts highlights in their hair they do it with light think really hard about doing that it's heaven culture because it's strange but i can't tell you how many people have said i love your pink hair and it opens a conversation about jesus christ that they didn't expect so i leave them in their soul with words they never expected to hear that he asked me to have this in person so the world would know he loved them and so i'm not bashing them or accusing them or threatening them i'm giving them life and they will never forget that [Applause] and guess what it's too late to escape because the anointing's already going into them and the anointing breaks uh so pink hair let you really see anointing green hair blue hair purple hair whatever they even put diamond dust in your hair in heaven it's beautiful isn't it and some people are so afraid to receive revelation and yet or they want well i like a cafeteria it's a cafeteria i'll take these revelations but these are just too wild i don't want them this is just too far out no i don't think that's god and when you miss him when you do that because if he's anointed someone to speak on his behalf and they live what they speak you should pay attention if they're sharing deception or if they're living unrighteously trying to tell you things from god i wouldn't take anything from them because their their souls been twisted either to live in deception and believe it and share it and you can tell deception they always end up by saying that you don't need jesus christ no matter what they start with it's an anti-christ spirit all the false religions are an antichrist spirit but the deception that is so released now into mainly into the body of christ because the world doesn't care the world wouldn't need the deception they don't know christ anyway so he's hitting the body of christ with deception and it sounds really good and even plausible because people can take the scriptures and make anything out of them and it can appear that it doesn't matter whether you sin or not you know or that god loves everybody so much the earth and the fullness thereof is here so he's taking everyone to heaven they'll actually use that scripture for that that's not what the word says or they'll say there is no satan there's there's beings like him but there is no real literal satan well then jesus was blinded when he was encountering them on the mountain of temptation he talked about him he was kicked out of heaven there is a being and i've seen him also and his eyes are filled with death but he's not red he doesn't have a pitchfork or a pointed tail i think that image is to make him look sort of like a cartoon but he's not he's deadly he hates everyone even his own demons he hates them he loves nothing or no one and his greatest desire is to take everyone to hell so we need to be fierce about winning people of course but in this day we have a greater revelation to do things in more powerful ways and accelerate it like be free stay free of everything by losing stuff from your soul the keys to the kingdom which you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven you don't have to keep not even a care if you realize that you're having a care you've been being concerned about stuff and then it goes into worry and then it can actually turn into sadness or even levels of grief or despair you don't want that in your soul so if i even realize that i'm sad i will loose that sadness from my soul i won't keep it you don't have to keep it we cast all our cares on christ one of my favorite scriptures another one is luke 2 52 and jesus increased in wisdom and stature in favor favor favor favor with god and man is that what it says yeah then we need to be doing that don't we when we take the word as truth absolute truth and we begin to apply that to our life you'll see your life change even if you didn't have revelation on it and you just start applying the word not just reading it it's a life book it's a book the way to live your life but when we start applying what we're reading he then gives us revelation so we can go from glory to glory we have weapons we have been given spiritual weapons not earthly weapons we're not supposed to fight against people everybody say that we do not war against the flesh so why do we do it because we're listening to the enemy he wants to keep us busy fighting so we will never come together because then we will be deadly he wants you dangerous but when you begin to come together and operate and rule and reign we will be deadly to the plans of the enemy will crush darkness push it out of whole regions he's going to have a miserable life [Applause] i want him miserable i want him terrified he's been doing that to us long enough christ didn't walk in fear i love the scripture fear not take no thought for your life if he holds it in his hand and you're running after him then nothing can take you out of his hand if he takes you home you're still in his hand [Applause] it says the grave and death they have no victory right and people go well we'll know each other in heaven no no death shouldn't even touch you in your thoughts life should be there not death to be spiritually minded is life so if you're focused on life and living and giving life and helping people to live and be greater and do greater then death will be far from you i love what he said about john when he said what is it to you if i let him remain till i come back they couldn't even kill him he's a good example of living life and sharing life the first words out of his mouth was always about life and love his last great message love one another they didn't want to hear they want to hear mighty mysteries they want to hear more revelations of heaven but they brought him out on the litter what did he say love one another we need to do that more too the more we focus on living and being something and doing something for god we're agreeing with him when you agree with him that is powerful the world should see as powerful they should see us loving helping and caring one another even more than we do the world it says to consider those of the household of faith first does it say that then we need to stop fighting each other lay down your differences you're going to live in heaven you'll wish you did it sooner i'm speaking to the pastors not just the body you're the example of god in your church start acting like him don't put fear in your people don't tell them the end is coming buy see rations and run to the hills tell them to get rid of the rapture rug let god decide when that happens get your crown on start reaching out to each other and caring cross those denominational lines or just wipe them out completely [Music] when the fire god begins to hit you you're not going to care what the name of your church is [Applause] the fire of god and the fear of the lord will hit you at the same time you crawl on your knees to love one another because you can't stand up you forget what you were fighting about christ set a wonderful example of loving people especially his disciples he gave me a whole new picture of them god took me back and let me see a life a day in the life of christ with his mary man now this was like in the first year he was with them when he was still having to tolerate them the sons of thunder there was a reason why they called him that they weren't calling fire and lightning down from heaven they were creating it on the earth because they fought over pretty girls they were so full of themselves they liked themselves a lot and competed a lot even while they were walking down the road to take the truth in the gospel behind the messiah luke the great physician all his patients were chasing him down the road why did you abandon us you left us for him we need you you took care of us we need we need you we we need you to take care of us we're sick don't you care about us and they're all hobbling down the road after luke the tax collector they were throwing rocks in him you better duck they didn't like him at all so here's jesus with this these these people that god had given him you ever felt that way about the god the people god sent you god sent to you are you sure because i don't think it sounds like you it doesn't look like what i thought it would look like i have to pray even harder for my own staff can you open their ears so they can hear simple things [Music] then when you think you got it made they're all together he adds some more that were harder than the first ones he sent you and god said i didn't make it easy on my son that's why he ran to the mountain to be with his father all the time don't you ever feel like you got to get away christ's dead and on top of that his family was always pursuing him this is not what we thought you would be doing are you done when are you coming home they didn't want him for his revelation they didn't even want him for the miracles he did i know they probably never asked him where did you hear that that's amazing wow you raised the dad are you coming home to make more wine from heaven now we gotta work your carpentry business it's going to the dogs don't you care about it does this sound like family and jesus knew he was going to be about his father's business and he didn't go back home do you realize sometimes they actually lived with him when they traveled so it wasn't like just going down the road he had to listen to when they all got together at the end of the day and in the beginning what they said wasn't good i know when you live positively and deal with life and someone starts talking negativity it's like crushing you it says don't be the friends of an angry man there's a reason for that you're going to get filled your soul get filled with it well if you live with someone who's negative every word that comes out of the mouth is negative you begin to you cannot bear it okay i taught all my family to lose stuff you better lose it because if you don't i'm gonna know it if you didn't ask for grace for that day that's gonna show up too no wonder jesus had to be filled with god's grace as a child it says so in the word as a child he filled him with his grace god has grace it's the abundant life grace that's at his throne of grace christ came to bring life grace for eternal life but he also was allowed to impart abundant life because as a child his father filled him with abundant life therefore he can impart it but god gives you infusion with you can impart it he knew he's going to need that grace to live with those men and yet look how powerful they changed the world didn't they they became exactly what he wanted them to become took a while but they had it in their soul they saw him he was mentoring them for three years gave his life and so their his life into their lives and was excited when they began to travel through the spirit realm like philip and where john became love he didn't just share love he became love he was saturated with love that's why he said the one that christ loved he didn't even give his name sometimes he talked about love poured love into people all the time that's why people were drawn to him after christ was gone he actually believed when he went to the tomb you know why he was the closest one to jesus he would not be apart from him he wanted to hear every word he said oh wow i can't believe time went by that fast the closer you get to christ the more you're going to become like him we cannot lead jesus out of anything that we're doing you wouldn't have any rights to do any of this you can't be a commander but we can't because he was a commander we can't be a creator but the father and he both were creators we can be creators we are over time because they were over time we're over the weather because christ was over the weather he didn't mind demonstrating he was trying to teach his disciples to do that we can multiply food i've already done that at a funeral he has connected me too he's so connected me to life after death no one can ever tell me there's not life after death there's more life after death than you had down here that's why we have to live on earth as they live in heaven so people can see life in us [Applause] christ was the lord of hosts this is my last thing i want to share with you it's about engaging with the army of heaven i love the song we're supposed to engage with the army people think that's just too weird we're not supposed to have anything i've heard something you're not supposed to worship angels do you know where that came from back in the day when the angels were sent watcher angels were sent to help educate mankind god put them here because he had no one on the earth to represent him they had severed the relationship with god so he couldn't teach him himself like he was teaching adam he literally put there's a whole tribe of angels called watch your angels they all have flesh melchizedek is the head of that tribe he also is the father's personal high priest he has always existed he wasn't someone who lived on the earth died and went to heaven became melchizedek i know people believe that even some of the jewish tribes believe that he was someone who you know walked on the earth but it said he has no father no mother no beginning nor end so there's still mysteries we need to know about but the hosts were created to protect us to guard us to keep us in all our ways part of that taking power over all the part of the enemy is using the host of heaven that army was created by the father in detailed tribes fierce they become weapons they ship shape from their person into weapons when they go and fight the demonic but he didn't need them to guard heaven he was on the throne so why did he make them they waited for ages to actually do what they're created to do to be weapons in our hands they those weapons they are mighty they literally can get ahold of the strongholds and pull them down we rule by what we say by the way we live our life like christ did he was a commander and the lord of hosts when he spoke they did it does christ live in you if we do the works he did and greater works than he did those angels were created for this time and day we live in for those who run in the kingdom who live in the kingdom who rule in the kingdom in that spiritual kingdom there is a spiritual army at our call walking is a man a righteous man on the earth christ said to the religious hierarchy if i wanted to i could call the army of heaven to come and fight on my behalf are we joint heirs of all that he had or did then why would that leave them out that's good they are bored there was a time and day on this earth that god said that said from this point on they will command an army like my son commanded an army because they are joint heirs i have created them to protect them keep them and all the way till one day they won't even dash their foot upon a rock and nothing by any means shall harm them you can fight against this revelation argue about it this is something from the father you invite heaven's army to be your weapon like you invited christ to be your savior and by the holy spirit to indwell you heaven protocol you have to invite they don't just come on their own generally in the past when we all pray in groups they could come and do some things in general areas but this is the time for us to be fierce to be focused to crush the plans of the enemy to have power over every single power of the enemy and they are a weapon your weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds you need to pursue that you can say i don't want it and not do it but in this day of what's coming on this earth they will protect you and keep you i have not been attacked at all from the day the father came and taught me how to invite heaven's army as a weapon and then give them orders to bring destruction to the plains the enemy to pull down strongholds wherever i go send them before i go somewhere so that nothing will hinder me haunt me or get in my way you can think about it pray about it but i know about revelation you don't just hear it you do it the work of the lord you don't just hear it you do it when you rule and reign you don't talk about it you do it if you're going to be violent against the enemy you can't just keep it inside and go i'm so upset and angry you do something about it so stand up i'm going to pray over all of you father i declare and decree that these children of you're standing here today that you open their ears to hear clearly spiritual ears open their eyes their spiritual eyes to see clearly in clarity let them see the host around them let them see them in the sky let them see them sitting beside them let them see carrying out orders because they were sent from headquarters [Music] by the lord of hosts who was their chief commander because he was a commander we are supposed to be commanders god said command ye me he didn't say beg yes this is our father i declare they will stand up and they will command they will rule there will be destruction they will push back darkness they will handle the wealth of the wicked they will get revelation they will have encounters they will not be the same because we are a new creation we'll be a sign and a wonder to this world because we won't be normal [Applause] i thank you father as people today choose to invite heaven's army if you want to say i choose with my will [Music] to be like christ i invite heaven's army sent by the lord of hosts to be one of my mighty weapons to pull down strongholds to slash the platforms the demonic have been ruling from to bash the demonic throw them in a dry place because we're creating regions of light so father i choose not to my will to take power over the power of the enemy who's attacking me and my family and i command the host of heaven you go now as my mighty weapon to put down the stronghold of the enemy to crush their plans to open up doors to reveal the things of god to let god be alive in me go host make toast to the enemy amen hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] amen let's shout again thank you jesus that was a new sound did you hear that that was a new shout out on locked warriors your unlocked warriors have a seat real quick 

[SPECIAL]Kat Kerr URGENT PROPHETIC AMERICA: OPERATION RESTART | April 21, 2021
by Sermon For You April 21, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLANiArcpU
or https://youtu.be/kBLANiArcpU
thought i would talk a little bit and then maybe jen could come up with some questions because you know we get them all the time either about heaven or something else but um yeah i'm so filled with god right now after doing that interview it was very powerful and so i thought i'd talk some more about the restart of america which is still continuing and i know some places is a little bit slower than others uh we're having really a great response from our governor here in florida so we're really excited about that we're praying for others who aren't really maybe getting the same response from theirs just remember on election day who you vote for next time and i just want to encourage you that that we're hearing more and more things are being reopened and then the reopening is being expanded to like more people able to attend and stuff like that i don't think they're quite ready to do mass crowds meeting together for big events and stuff like that so i'm sure a lot of people are being affected by that i'm sure that that was not easy for any of them and i know many people try different things like drive-by church you know online church was amazing yay dede and david in colorado at um up on lookout mountain they did a great job i think they broadcasted every single night since the quarantine happened they're still doing it and they're still doing it and that would be um gateway on mount zion gateway on mount zion online you can go yeah their facebook page or their website their website in uh yeah gateway on mount zion in golden colorado they're really powerful and i know there were many others who do that i just happen to know that they are one of them and let me tell you god is going to be really be visiting places it was a wonderful thing the day the holy spirit invaded our earth and let me tell you he is my best friend make sure you know him well he will share things with you to come he'll give revelation on the word of god he'll tweak your life all day long and jen and i both know he does that with us he'll even go shopping with you and tell you the best deals to get and honestly i'll even go to get something like i want to pick apples out he'll actually tell me don't get those get these other ones are going to taste better it depends on how much you open yourself up to him you know he's the third member of passing that's what god's been saying is just going to pass on and there will be no second wave he has assured me of that many times so i hope that encourages some people and i know in other countries people really also been praying to god for many things that they need help with and we pray for people all the time to be touched by god to be ministered for resources to come for help to come to different people and you know i know to some people it looks like utterly impossible don't say it's impossible you need to stay with god all things are possible and begin to thank him for the things you need if you've been praying and asking him that's fine but start thanking him for these things it says call those things that be not as though they were that means you talk about them like they're already here that's called faith so i want to encourage everybody i hope your faith has been increased during this time and i know this is something probably most people will never forget of course there'll be generations coming behind us that don't know anything about that but i think this has been a very different time and and hopefully the best part of you has come out during this time don't forget to pray and reach out to others there are many people who we may have less of things but let me tell you there's some that have nothing and my dad's heart was always to help those kind of people we spent years and years helping people feeding them finding them clothes finding them jobs finding houses for them that was just put in me and so that's my heart is to be help people be generous you know and sometimes be generous even when you need something yourself that touches the heart of god when you give out of your own need it really does touch god's heart and i know that right now he's got great things prepared for all of us i just finished saying that in our interview with steve schultz of elijah's i'm going to encourage everyone out there if you are not signed up to elijah list.com you need to go do that because he has the proven prophets you'll hear words from prophets some you know some you don't know and then you can watch and see what god does once they have spoken and declare things he's had me on there several times just discussing things prophesying things god has said and he won't let people come on there if all they want to do is bash and bring doom and gloom and death and destruction this is not the time for that to happen in this earth these are the greater days of god and so i really want to encourage you keep declaring that the restart operation restart will be fully taking place and that people will be able to go back to somewhat of a normal life i hope it's not going to be normal as far as god is concerned i hope you've increased your relationship with your family and with him and then get ready for some awesome things to begin to happen for all of us and that we also pray for people in other countries god i thank you for helping to bring supply to those countries that don't have supply we speak against and take authority over any of the virus right now we won't tolerate the virus even anywhere on the earth in jesus name we are over sickness and disease we are not under it christ was never upset he was never controlled by any form of sickness or disease when he walked down this earth and you shouldn't either he didn't have to put up with lack okay with violence he didn't have to put up with um any forms of oppression or depression he didn't keep in him and he didn't participate with it and make sure you're saying that yourself there's people out there right now if you're oppressed don't tolerate it loose it out of your soul get rid of it don't let it control you don't let fear control you because this is not going to drag on for years and years and why am i saying that because i was in the grocery store the other day and the person just you know just ringing up my my supplies they were saying that their self oh i just think this is going to last for years what are we going to do we don't have any kind of a life and i said well that is not correct this is for a very short time it's going to pass and then your life will begin to increase again so anywhere i can give hope or encouragement to people i'm going to do that that's what we're supposed to do and so thank you for all your prayers and all you guardians i want to thank you so much for your support you have blessed our hearts you've blessed the heart of god every chance i get i'm going to make sure i thank them and we have so many more things coming we have other broadcasts right coming up more programs coming up right now that we're designing and creating so today because we have some extra time in the the studio is all set up we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and answer some questions i think jen has some questions that she can ask me we've been trying to figure out why the internet was sticking so and i do know you know that we've had some issues here techno you know with some of the technical stuff here that i don't understand yeah i don't understand that at all i just know that i know how to talk and so that's my part and we do take authority over and we're not towering the enemy getting in any of our systems frequencies technology whatever it is we're kicking him out in jesus name because i know people are probably out there praying now i'm in agreement with every one of you and so we want to have a great broadcast and a signal to be strong in jesus name so what do you have today jen for a question well i just asked everybody on facebook can i play the intro oh yeah oh we're gonna we're gonna do a short q a so we're gonna let you see our little intro we're gonna so okay we're ready for our q a but before we start i already have a question that i was asked the other day and jen just reminded me people are asking about our 2020 calendar i know the year is almost half over but this isn't just about the months or the days of the months this is about revealing heaven and these calendars we create are what god wants he wants to reveal heaven to the earth the spirit realm to the earth the host of heaven the army of heaven whatever it is he once revealed that's part of our job to reveal heaven to earth and so they want to know about our calendar because we've been talking about it lately there's some fun activities in there that you can do with us that interact with us and one happens to be this month that's how this whole thing started this is the calendar right here i hope you can see it it's called the world called heaven and on the cover is an actual picture of a place that exists in heaven we all know about hebrews 12 1 that talks about the great cloud of witnesses that are watching this from heaven this is one of the places they do that this is called the portal and they have them all over heaven people come in way here this is the doorway walk down here they walk up steps these are steps that go up here to this opening you can see the opening right there and that's where people look down in they can view the earth declare over the loved ones see things happening good things happening on the earth and they sing they go and sing to you on your birthday they they understand they get to see weddings and babies being born and all kinds of things like that so this is a beautiful place that's mentioned in the bible i was taken to that place and so this entire calendar actually that's what this is about and every month you see a place or a being that is in heaven and i'll show you one more and uh but we have special days we put in here we put some of our own days in here what is not in here is satan's holiday you won't see that okay we're not giving him any place whatsoever uh and so let me find one of the other places there's so many i want to show you this is just awesome and most of these places were places i personally was taken to in heaven here's one of somebody going home to heaven this is called the transport and this woman who you can see standing there with the red hair she was 90 in her 90s when she passed and when she stepped her spiritual body stepped out of her body this is what she looked like young and happy she's very happy those are her two guardian angels about to take her home to heaven and then over here you'll find an explanation at the bottom of the picture over here you'll find an explanation of what this picture is about so you you get understanding not just images and then like i said and at the bottom of every month we have a declaration that we make like here this one says heaven celebrates each time a believer comes home so you get this at the end of each calendar month we make a declaration like that for you so it's very exciting you will see places in heaven you never even dreamed were there we do still have some left but the reason people want them is because we have interactive days like we have a day we said uh tell people you know show us with you wearing angel wings and that was one of the days and but you have to use the email email address that is on the calendar for those interactive things we do still have some left so maybe for the next month or so we'll have some so you can find them on revealingheaven.com go to our website click on the store and you'll see this calendar there uh we are already in the in the we are already right now creating to the 2021 calendar and the one before this one which was 2019 was about the host of heaven we we revealed and introduced heaven's army into the earth because the father had asked us to do that and so there's many other things in here i'll show you one more this is called the hall of knowledge i'm not the only one who's been there there's these beautiful towers made out of emerald like they look like emerald glass you ride on roads of light through these towers and that you can learn all kinds of different things the books actually show you the book you would take the book out of the niche and you lay it on this little table and it opens up and shows you like a movie of what's in the book this is heaven this is not the earth so if you're interested make sure you go to revealingheaven.com you can ask for on the web store on the web store and then you can find the world called heaven calendar and they need to click on the correct link that pertains to where they live there's a link for canada there's a link for the us and then there's a link for all other countries because you know we ship internationally around the world and they have different costs for different um for shipping and so that's why it's important you click on the right one so your calendar is not sent to the wrong country and so there you go there's a little bit of information from a question that we got so what do you have next jen um i have a question from eagle eagle and um they asked can our loved ones visit us in our dreams how can our loved ones visit us in our dreams the loved ones from heaven eyes and right yes that happens to many people people have very vivid dreams and i would have to say absolutely that does happen god speaks to people and visions and dreams it says so in the bible so that is possible for you to have a dream or even a vision of your loved one in heaven and actually some people have been caught up to heaven while they were sleeping and didn't realize that and they have very vivid dreams of being in heaven with their loved ones so you know with god those things are possible but absolutely that is possible for that to happen and sometimes it will happen like right after somebody passes away um i've heard of some people just appearing briefly in the room and waving sometimes they don't say anything sometimes they just say i want you know i'm okay or i love you and i think that depends on getting permission from the father for them to get permission from the father to do that i know people are so undone and overwhelmed when they first get to heaven their whole head and heart is just trying to take in that glorious place of splendor in heaven and of course the relationships they have with people they are meeting the father and the son and holy spirit just seeing the beauty that's there the things you prepare for them their own mansion they're just getting undone it's like one gift every time they go somewhere else it's something beautiful but yes i do believe it's possible to have dreams and visions okay um i found this question almost quite well not really humorous so it's it's a good one it's from dawn and she said cat do angels ever mess up like when someone gets in an accident or something is that them maybe not paying attention or slacking off on their job lol just always wondered about that i don't think it's about an angel if an angel messed up it wouldn't be something to do with rescuing somebody or protecting somebody i think so many different circumstances issues in our own lives you know the enemy will try to attack anywhere that he can make sure you're declaring and decreeing against that happening make sure that you're involving the army of heaven in your life um make sure there's all kinds of things so i have to say for sure angels don't mess up on something that would be that important they probably you know you have to realize these are real these beings have real personalities like you and i they all have souls they all have emotions and so i think sometimes maybe they're not quite getting along especially on an assignment i think they would get maybe a harder assignment given to them i do know sometimes that does happen i don't know how often but like i said some people have stronger personalities some have really fun personalities i know that there's some angels that are almost like comedians and there's others who are very focused and fierce against the enemy and that whatever their personality is that that's definitely going to come out in their assignments that god gives them of course they're answerable to him the thing about being an angel is nothing is hidden god definitely knows everything that's going on with them and they live with him so i think he has to handle that stuff and i know um we always have new people that come in or people that haven't heard you talk about stuff and people who've heard you say this stuff a million times but it's like certain people need to hear it and i really feel like um i want to ask this question this is from pam and she said you may have addressed this already please forgive me if it's a redundant i am a nurse you've mentioned we will do the same work in heaven there isn't any sickness or lack in heaven we all that um i know i've done on earth uh let's see what will i do for papa god if my job won't be needed well it's not your job it's not your job that you do in heaven nobody has a job it says actually says you labor no more what you do for a living is not what you'll be doing in heaven unless you've been using the gift he put in you let's say someone who's a recording artist and they're singing and they're so anointed they will be doing that in heaven but they'll be doing it for everybody in heaven for free so it's probably your hobby or something that is your passion uh maybe even though you were a nurse and you took care of people of course there is absolutely no sickness in heaven whatsoever they don't need lawyers doctors nurses there's all kinds of things they just don't need them in heaven because that stuff doesn't exist there but somewhere in you he put a natural gift not a job okay those are skills i'm not talking even about skills skills can be learned but a gift is something he puts in you and that's the thing you love to do the most that's how you can tell what it is it says every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights that would be you and when he made you in your little spirit man he placed in that spirit man a gift whether it is an artist whether it is a dancer whether you're going to sing whether you're going to grow the best flowers ever whether you're gonna make the best i don't know chimichangas uh donuts whatever it is the culinary arts are absolutely i don't know where that came from somebody probably likes them i don't like them whatever whatever okay baker's bakers are loved in heaven because let me tell you he gives you your own shop everything you make it all make all the wonderful stuff there's no gluten free no weight gain i can just go on and on yeah none of this stuff you don't have to have keto you don't have to eat keto stuff at the same time and so they're let me tell you there's fried chicken there's pizza i've been to a pizza parlor and haven't had ice cream cones and everyone that's their gift because that was their passion on the earth and they knew that it says your gifts and your callings are without repentance and he will not take irrevocable means he'll never take it away that means if he put in you to be an artist yes and maybe you never actually had a gallery or anything like that but maybe all you want to do is sketch you're a great sketch artist maybe you you understand colors and stuff like that maybe you want to make pottery with your hands but you don't do that for a living but it's your passion that's your gift it's what your passion is maybe it was a drummer and one grandson he started drumming on everything before he was a year old we knew he was going to be a drummer guess what he still loves it that's his gift when he goes to heaven one day he'll be a drummer that's not a job you don't have to labor it's not something that you don't like it's not something that's hard it's like breathing you love it so much so guess what and all that i do and all that jen does we are photographers my gift is i'm not going to be a revelator in heaven okay i'm not going to be a prophet in heaven i'm not going to be those things i'm not going to be any minister i'm not going to do that i will be a photographer why because i love it it is my passion from the time i was little i'd make fake little cameras with a box and pretend i was taking pictures until i got my first camera and i have never stopped loving it i already know in heaven i'll have a studio come by and see me one day when you get there i'll take your pictures for free and create beautiful stuff out of that so that's what you'll do whatever your hobby is whatever your passion is it's in there somewhere that's what you will be and all your property will be designed that's why there's amusement parks there's rodeos there's all kinds of wonderful fun things there and every time someone comes home to heaven there's something new and exciting to do but they're not working they're not laboring it is the most fun they've ever had in their life so there that's a good answer for those people who don't know they keep sitting on the pew their church this is what god says all my people keep sitting on the pew of their church trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is and yet the thing i want them to know the most is what is their natural gift that i made them when i sent them to the earth because when you get home to heaven that'll be the most exciting thing you do there yep okay one more what's one more okay um i've been screen shotting questions okay um back to uh the when you were talking about the angels um this one person didn't quite understand her her name is i want to say remy home um she said how could they not get along there is no evil in the angels so i guess she does she thinks they fight no no no i'm not talking about fighting like evil there is no evil there is no hate they don't do that in heaven but they have personalities everybody has a personality okay and you have to understand angels are spiritual beings we're physical beings okay we both have a soul but we have to make our we all get to make our own decisions because you're a believer and you're going to heaven doesn't mean you always you don't ever have disagreements with people okay there is no anger no coveting there's no jealousy in heaven there's no wrath nobody fights nobody hits somebody nobody does things spiteful i'm not talking about that kind of stuff i forget sometimes to relate things my answers to heaven culture and not earth culture so your mind is thinking earth culture earth atmosphere earth living it's not like that in heaven but not everybody wants the same thing even in heaven but they still agree to enjoy their self to have fun you still have your favorite things your favorite colors in heaven that god doesn't take all that away from you but there is no anger no wrath no hating no spitefulness no coveting there's no offense that part that part of your your flesh emotions because right now we're spirit man but we still have our flesh when he talks about your flesh lay down your flesh right that's not talking about you dying as a person that's talking about your opinions your rights your attitudes your anger issues that's the flesh that stuff is not there but people still have their personalities their likes or dislikes and sometimes when angels are sent on assignment god on purpose and this is why he does it there's no marriage between the angels they don't get married on this earth we get married and one of the things that he does with marriages sharpens the husband and wife that doesn't mean get you angry enough that you divorce but it stretches us right it makes us to come into agreement on different things sometimes you know we have to give a little take to get you know we have to come together in agreement even as husband and wife but it stretches it says steal sharpen steel that's what happens when you're married you sharpen each other you make each other care more understand things aren't going to be perfect but you're you're willing to work it out in heaven they don't have that so god has another way that the angels get stretched right and he sends different personalities on assignment and i happen to know this is true because two that were assigned to me for a while one was a comedian the other one was so fierce against darkness he wanted to talk about being holy he wanted to talk about crushing the enemy that would be satan his plans the other one wanted to make jokes because he was funny his personality was totally opposite of the southern angels they stretched each other every time they were with me they didn't get angry each other so forget about the anger thing that's earth thinking but angels have personalities in heaven and they like many different things and they have friends amongst each other no romance okay they don't happen in heaven um the angels who fell tried that it didn't work so that's what i'm talking about when i said you know it's not like your flesh getting involved i'm talking about on the earth when you loosen stuff from your soul get grace for that day and you work through your things you don't get offended you don't get in wrath um because we have help from heaven okay one more next question angel question and then i have a question i have a 13 year old um wow melissa wants to know do we have the same guardian angel our whole life yes you have the same guardian angel your entire life at the time you are conceived when life begins life doesn't begin when a baby's born life begins the time of conception and from that moment your angel your guardian angel or angels are sent from heaven they are will you your entire life they are the ones who help bring you home to heaven when your body dies and your spiritual body steps out the first one you will see normally will be your guardian angels and they escort you home in a transport all different ways you can be taken chariots you can be taken to heaven they will be with you the whole time awesome okay um charity's 13 year old daughter her name is i want to say lyanna but she would like to know can we ever get kicked out of heaven no but he's going to get kicked out of heaven that only happened once and that would be satan and all the angels who fell with him they were the only ones who'd been kicked out of heaven all right they decided to go against god to try to take over heaven that was a long time ago and so he was one third of all the angels in heaven how about that that's crazy chose satan chose lucifer as their new leader and they all got kicked out but no one who goes there you're not going to get kicked out of heaven okay when you step out of your physical body with your spiritual body you already whatever things whatever issues you had whether it was anger against somebody or you had issues maybe you didn't even like yourself all that is gone okay those things you don't carry up to heaven the people you cared about the gifts he put in you to use that stuff remains with you and excitement adventure and all kinds of wonderful things are in heaven but you can't get kicked out of heaven because when you receive jesus christ as your savior all the stuff all the sins in you get wiped away like they never happen don't let the enemy remind you of your sins if you repented of them all right now even god can remember them because you told him that you were sorry for them and so i can assure you that no one's going to get kicked out of heaven okay and um this is another one you've answered before but i love to hear you talk about this um erica's brother she didn't say what his name was but he wants to know if there is hunting in heaven this is a fun answer actually that's why i asked it i think you know jen knows a lot because she's heard so many probably she's probably heard every single time i went to heaven and for those of you who don't know me yes god has never stopped catching me up to heaven yes he can do that because he wants to no i don't choose to go myself this is all free for all of you so you understand god caught people up to heaven in the old testament it says so he caught people up to heaven in the new testament without dying and he still does that because he chooses to and so she knows just about every time he caught me up not in this physical body it would stay behind you catch me my spirit man my spiritual body that looked just like me but a lot better and so what was the question erica's brother now if there's hunting in heaven is there hunting in heaven you'd be surprised what god has uh has in heaven but it's the way he does it this different okay almost everything we have on the earth is in heaven except there's no killing no no harm nobody gets injured uh none of that happens in heaven okay so um i'm getting distracted today is there like are you seeing angels well there are angels all over in here right now okay of course i could get distracted just by the one that's behind me and the one who's two on here the one standing by you the one standing by chris okay the one's sticking their heads with the ceiling looking down and the ones looking through i'm gonna figure oh yes because you know i don't really want to hunt maybe well no we won't say that i don't hunt i don't want to hurt anything maybe mosquitoes there's hunting in heaven but this is the way god does it because nothing gets killed remember what i said no creatures are killed all animals are called creatures in heaven they all talk they all have actually uh amazing personalities but you do go to the mountain of spices that actually exist in heaven and what you do is a camera shoot you're capturing the image and they actually have a clubhouse in this whole place and you will be hunted by the creatures with their own cameras while you're hunting them and your goal when you get to heaven is to be the first one to get their picture which is sent back to this huge clubhouse with like a 40-50 foot screen and down in the corner is the one who captured you and on the screen is the one that was captured and so all these people i actually saw people in heaven doing that they had you know pack horses and they were packing all their camera equipment on these horses they even have different type cameras that look like sort of like a scope thing and when you some of these creatures are not anywhere on the earth by the way so you're really hunting something that's fantastic but more times than not when you get back to the clubhouse you will see your face plastered all over the big screen and in the corner will be the creature who captured you by getting that picture first so it's very intense because while you're hunting to find the creatures to get their pictures it's a camera shoot remember you're not gonna hurt anything but how intense is that hunting process when you're looking for something that's never been seen before and yet they're probably smarter than you they hide to you and they get you first when you go back thinking wow i know i snapped that picture and you walk in the clubhouse and there's your face plastered all over you know that you were busted and you were caught not them but the intensity and excitement even increases more so in heaven but nobody gets hurt or harmed and no life is taken so you will still get to do that try your best if you can when you get there okay i have a um another question you've talked about before but um holy spirit really wants me to ask this so um do aborted babies and babies in general have their own mansions especially when they grow up or if not where do they live i brought this everybody everyone no matter who they are will eventually have their own mansion jesus said in my father's house that's a world by the way just you understand god's house is the world called heaven bigger than our galaxy and uh trust me there's plenty of room for mansions and when little babies go home to having every baby who dies passes leaves this earth with however you want to say it whether through abortion miscarriage or because they were sick or whatever if when they die and they go home to heaven they will know family members in heaven uh they will grow very slowly uh we've actually know of people who when they were 40 years old died on the operating table saw their seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold who died years before that but because they the the mother went in her spiritual body her son recognized him he still looked seven years old he was playing with friends on the streets of gold and he recognized her and actually told her you can't stay you have to go back but god allowed her to see her son number one he was well and whole he was happy he was playing he had friends and his mom came back of course she survived her operation and for years her and her husband would travel around the world and tell people about the beauty and the love of god that their child was still waiting on them in heaven now she's already home in heaven so when the parent comes home to the baby they actually get to take the baby from the nurseries and i have a picture here's one of the nursery walls that i saw in heaven right here and i gotta make sure that the lights not reflecting tilt it down oh here yeah there we go that's good if you can see that these are some of the babies beds that were on this nursery wall i saw now they weren't sleeping babies don't have to sleep in heaven but they have these beautiful like a little niche these are little tiny babies most of them and the angels give them a nickname unless the parents have named them and they grow so slowly birds come in and the birds take them for rides around heaven all kinds of fun things for them to do they can sing laugh dance and god has this beautiful place for them and they will be there until either the grandparents come home or somebody close to that baby in relation they get to take them and keep them to the parents get there the parents take turns raising them and eventually they grow they step into the gift remember we talked about gifts they each have a gift whether it could be anything designing um it could be like music it could be art it could be dance it could be culinary arts it could be creating all kinds of gifts and things for people making things out of gems i know they have jewelers and things in heaven whatever their natural gift is they'll still use that in heaven they'll step into their gift and eventually they will have their own mansion when we come home to heaven we come home as god's son or daughter and all those babies will be growing in the most beautiful amazing place loved by jesus himself and fun places that he made for them so your babies know who you are they definitely can't wait for you to get to heaven so that was beautiful you brought that jen okay um this question is from jan vincent and he wants to know if you can practice christianity and witchcraft no and what if you you cannot claims that he pray for people and heal people with jesus name but yet also do witchcraft stuff i will tell you what the bible says there'll be some people who go there one day and jesus will say depart from me i never knew you you cannot practice evil and say you are a believer too you cannot do both when you become when you practice witchcraft you're partnering with satan even the bible talks about that it was called necromancing in the bible and it's all evil it belongs to satan witchcraft controls and i know that one day they'll actually be people that are called themselves good witches there is no good witch and i've heard from some of them myself and let me tell you when you partner with satan he will lie to you deceive you but you cannot you have to choose one or the other because christianity you believe in jesus christ as your savior he does not tolerate witchcraft he never practiced witchcraft he spoke against witchcraft even himself in the new testament so it's wrong it belongs to the enemy and this is a thing people will get healed in the name of jesus it's jesus's name healing them but that doesn't mean they get reward for that and the bible says will be people who come before god there's also people who say they're a christian but they sin in bad ways they sin but they go hold meetings people get saved they'll get healed they may get words from god because that doesn't stop operating you the way you choose your own life to live and what you personally choose yourself will be demonstrated by the way you live your life that means you can't be a witch and you can't belong to jesus you have to choose okay because when you die whoever owns you or you serve will come to get you and if you're practicing witchcraft that gives the enemy the right to come and get you when you die so i would not mess around with that get witchcraft out of your life i pray for people to be delivered from witchcraft spirits that doesn't come from god so don't play around don't read books on witchcraft don't go see movies about witchcraft you're opening a door in your soul for the enemy to begin to control you and these people who think they can be do both are under a great deception so i'm just saying there's evil people people who are doing wrong sinning but going and having meetings people come they get saved by the name of jesus they get healed by the name of jesus they get worse because the holy spirit is going to speak to those people it isn't that person okay don't follow people who you know are sinning don't do it because you follow jesus christ those who believe the word of god and live the word of god there's double accountability for leaders and so he will hold them doubly accountable but it says one day when they come before him and want the reward there will not only be no reward he will not allow them to remain okay so you can't you can't do evil and do god you have to choose god you cannot have evil in your life and witchcraft is one of those satanism is witchcraft any false religion don't try to practice two religions at the same time any witchcraft and you don't allow it in you make sure you're running your race to make a difference for jesus christ it says for us to be like him he didn't practice any of that he actually spoke against it so those people are deceived there you go okay um this one's really long but i'm not going to read the whole entire thing and uh again you have discussed this but um this is from charity um herself and she says she has such a struggle with being you know you can share on this experience i can share on this i absolutely can share on this and number one i want to let you know this god does not approve of any violence no abuse okay no kind of abuse whatsoever whether it's physical abuse verbal abuse god is against that and and let me tell you this that he would rather you be by yourself than be with someone who's abusing you i know that many spiritual leaders through the years have said uh and it can happen on both sides okay i'm not saying i know women that were violence and abuse their husbands and i know men that were violent and abused their wives it happened on both sides so you can't say one is worse than the other abuse is abuse okay uh but for instance let's just say for instance i had prayed for people before they were under severe abuse and this was a wife and she was abused physically all the time and when she went to her pastor they would say you cannot leave your husband the bible says you cannot do that no that was not the right thing to say to them okay god does not put up with abuse he doesn't approve of anybody abusing anybody you certainly have the right to not be abused and this is the thing if it is sin let's just say it's sin if we say it sin sins can be forgiven if you divorced and it wasn't out of abuse when you just divorced you didn't want that person you you divorced them you can go before god and say i repent of that that doesn't mean you have to go back to the person you're already divorced your pen is wiped away sin is wiped away people you can't hold those sins against people not even things they did 30 years ago if they repented of those things then god doesn't remember them anymore and i happen to know myself personally some people don't like me after i tell them this i went out and picked out somebody it wasn't god's choice this is what the bible says and god came to me himself one day and i was abused horribly uh when i was married to somebody else and god came to me and said how long are you going to put up with that and i said well what should i do about it he said you have a contract you don't have a covenant he said my word says what god has joined together let not man put asunder what that means is don't let man end it he said if if god put it together if it was god who brought you together and then again even if you did and you repented for doing that later it's still forgiven okay people don't like it when i say that sin is sin if you repent it's forgiven no matter what kind of sin that is it's it says that he remembers it no more he's not going to treat you like a lower human being okay god's not going to do that i'm still pursuing my destiny i repented of that and uh god said end the contract so we i got divorced because god told me to he said you'll never be who i need you to be if you remain married to that person i didn't bring you that person that is not my choice that's not a covenant a covenant is when i bring you together i didn't look for anyone god brought me the husband i have now we've been married 43 years and let me tell you a marriage is a trial it's a trial it's a challenge because you've got two individuals coming together as one maybe you like different things you do things different ways make sure that you're marrying the person god has for you and even then there could be conflict but make sure you're praying for each other i'm just going to include all this in this package that's not just a yes or no thing now yes or no abuse is as bad as running around on your spouse it's still abuse that is mental abuse if you're married and you go find someone else and sleep with them and you you choose them over your spouse and you're still married and all this is going on that is sin that is for sure sin but it's abuse god puts abuse in that same line that says that talks about adultery in that home meaning is severe abuse and that's what he recognizes even in the bible that you can be divorced if that happens this is a very touchy question but i don't mind answering it okay i suffered a lot of abuse but put up with it for six and a half years until i finally said to god what do i do and he said how long are you going to tolerate it i had to repent to the person i married i didn't even love them i had to repent to them i'd repent for them that that had to be ended because god had asked me to end it so there was repentance on my side and then god brought me the right person and i married them because he said you will marry this person so people can fight and argue and yell all you want to it's about what you repent from if it was wrong what you did it's been ended and it's over and maybe the other person is remarried he certainly doesn't expect you to go after them and make them remarry you you repent for the whole situation give yourself to god and he probably most more than likely will bring you somebody else to be with you god doesn't want us to be alone okay and the reason why he has marriage is so we don't have to go through this life alone it says the marriage bed that means you know what that means that means a living together having physical relations when you're married god approves of that when you're not married and you live together and do that he does not approve of that and there's many reasons why because when you come together you're actually sharing your soul with each other this is more than you ever thought you were going to get this is what happens when you ask the deep questions okay and the more of yourself you give when you're married you're empowering each other but when you're not married and you're sharing physical relations with each other you're giving parts of your soul away layers that you shouldn't be doing that to someone you're not married to so there's your whole story it's all about abiding in god married they're christians and they marry someone who's not it's a much harder lifestyle if they don't want to agree with what you're doing maybe make sure you find that up before you get married but i can tell you that if anyone repents they are forgiven and you can't drag that stuff up and throw it back in their face again because what you that is then wrong okay you have to forgive too even it was something that was done to you that that unforgiveness will hurt you worse than what you experienced before in your life get rid of all unforgiveness and all offense no matter what it was and you run your race and let god bless you and so there's that very long answer about that question but god doesn't tolerate abuse in any marriage no physical abuse no mental or emotional abuse that beats you up until you feel like you're nothing at all he doesn't want you to stay in a situation like that okay he doesn't and so uh pray let god open doors of safety for you and you seek him to see what you're supposed to do next but he does love you there you go so um somebody actually asked me a question oh wow jen what did they ask you they wanted to know if i've ever been to heaven okay so come over here and say thank me if they ask you then you give them their answer hey i'm kind of in my gym clothes still it's okay everybody looks like that right now anyway so i've never been to heaven but i have had um three open visions uh during the time that i was writing the the first children's book and well two times were with the first children's book and then the third time was during the well well i've been writing the second but he did something special for you didn't he yes um when i was writing the first book i wrote one sentence down and i was in my office and my whole office went black and then my wall kind of opened up like a movie screen and i it was like i was seeing the book come alive so it was all in cartoon form every time i've ever had an open vision about heaven it's been in cartoon form that's cool and so i was seeing the characters in the book and walking down the streets of gold and um one of the times that that happened they were going into the amusement park which kat talks about in her first book and i was seeing all kinds of things um and things that i had never heard her talk about and so it was like i was walking with them i didn't see myself on the path but i knew i was walking with them seeing my characters walking down the streets of gold and going into the amusement park and one of the things that really fascinated me which is going to be in the first kids book is i saw a merry-go-round and instead of uh the horses that you sit on there are actual live animals and they were whole the the people children adults and there were even some animals writing on there so it looks like animals it was quite funny um but they were riding on the backs and they had rains and then instead of their little platform yeah instead of a pole being down the middle um they were on a platform that would go up and down and i had never heard her talk about i didn't know that and so i was so excited it went in when the vision was over i come running out of my office to tell her what i saw and and she's like yeah that's up there so um and there were other things that i saw too and what what were some of the well or some of the animals you could write on jen not what you would think yes it is was um dinosaurs there was even a whale so apparently somebody had always wanted to ride a whale i mean i guess it it wasn't huge so it shrunk down to fit on the merry-go-round but there was a seahorse that didn't need water to breathe no it didn't it didn't and there was uh jungle animals uh you know like elephants and lions and real ones yeah real ones breathing ones and it was really cool and uh there was like a little raccoon that was on the back of i think it was like a hippo or something it was so funny but um yeah and they like lollipops don't they yes the raccoons like yeah yeah because they even saw a raccoon riding on the rush yeah so that that was my experience and it was it's happened three times now yeah and uh so yeah that'd be awesome yeah yeah that was a great answer i'm back over here now okay maybe a couple more questions so that we can we do have a couple more things i have to do today but how much fun is this to just have a just a spontaneous q a session and now you find out some people can see heaven and cartoon form that would be really cool so oh let's see and so when you see like you know teal squirrels or or purple elephants yes that exists in heaven everything is different colors in heaven i love when you talk about the messenger squirrels yes that we're talking the greeters the breeders i've always called a messenger squirrels they're greeters they sing and dance with top hats the squirrels when you have a party somewhere in your home yes people have parties and they come to entertain and they have top hats and canes and some of the best dancers i've ever seen and you you you just you know get home and say hey we're having a party we'd like for you to come do some some of your performance you never know what's going to happen up there it's just great so what would you say to someone who's been praying and asking to see jesus and angels and it hasn't happened yet i would say um stop praying and asking and start thanking him i'm real serious about that because it happens at the most unexpected times and it's usually not when you're asking i'm just gonna give you a free little tip and many times it's not when you're praying either most of my encounters i have in heaven is not when i'm praying somewhere i'm not even reading my bible i'm doing everyday stuff and he catches me up and sometimes i'm doing everyday stuff and then an angel walk up walk up and say something or i'll see them doing things or um so you have to just understand you think if you don't get in some spiritual position of what you think would be proper then it's not going to happen jesus also visits me when i least expect it and so i would just say expect have an expectancy that is going to happen you know and i you know maybe share to people i'm expecting this to happen and you'd be surprised how soon or quickly it happens then well i know the first time i saw an angel which was um um the one that was watching uh ben do the shipping and receiving yeah we've seen i was working at my desk typing right here in this room and at the core of my eye i just see this most radical looking angel leaning he's just like like this watching him pack up the products to ship out and i was like okay and i just kept on typing you know what even the angels love it that we're sharing heaven and all of our products represent something about heaven or living righteously or being dangerous against hell all of the products we put up for that reason and we we do have mp3s now we have dvds cds mp3s we have photographs we have artwork now we have calendars we have cups we have all kinds of stuff we're creating um to to demonstrate and manifest heaven like here's one of the cups right here i have one it says i don't do demons and there's a little lightning bolt representing when they were all kicked out of heaven you know then once you follow loose for that's what that lightning bolt represents some hell doesn't like it that we market stuff like this because it points fingers at them anyway so we do all kinds of things so angels are going to be present even if you don't see them they're present if you're speaking on behalf of god when you're praying they're there your angels always there maybe turn around every now and then say thank you for watching over me that's perfectly okay you're not sitting down having tea with them however if god allows it enjoy it we're living in a different life and time now and i know that before the end does come which is generations away it will be normal for you to see angels in your home and angels in your car outside your car because they're there all the time i see them and i know more and more the spiritual realm and these are spiritual beings in the spirit realm the spirit realm will be more and more visible in our lives so you live in a great time okay you live in a great time and great things are about to happen in this earth even in the midst of everything else god has his plans and so i would just encourage you we'll probably take one more question and that will be it for today and you never know when we're going to show back up again yes i i hope that you're enjoying this time with us and uh even though it was unplanned i love spontaneous spontaneous still happens in heaven okay okay and so uh well we'll let jen um okay share one more question um okay this might take a while but i know we've discussed this before that's okay someone wants to know i don't i don't didn't see who asked the question but someone wants to know is the virus the mark of the beast or the the vaccine the vaccine it's the mark of the beast uh we we've had this long conversation about this everything is many years something comes up that is the mark of the beast yes and i have lived along with you and let me tell you they were doing it back in the 50s oh i was alive oh even mom it my our mom who was born in the 30s she was born in the 30s they said even back then they were saying that the rapture was coming the rapture was coming you know you know what he says about all that just so you know revelation 21 the very end of the bible okay the very end of the bible there's so much still that has to happen the best of things other than christ being born him dying on the cross tearing up hell wasting hell okay those were amazing powerful things the holy spirit coming those were great times but we're entering into some of the most powerful exciting times as a believer that's your life that's the what you what's coming for your life okay but i can tell you the mark of the beast is nowhere right now there's nothing that's been created on the earth that is the mark of the beast at all in any way whatsoever it isn't the michael chip oh no they used to say the bar code okay when i was going to the barcode you're going to walk around with a bar called this big on your head right that was going to be the mark of the beast this is the crazy thing i will say this the mark a mark is a visible mark you will see it a visible permanent mark you will see it with your eyes it's not something hidden in your skin it's not something that will happen or a frequency that will be around no it's not the 5g it's not 5g people this is what god said about 5g that just means the gospel will go further and stronger than ever before around the world around the world which is his purpose so don't look for the 5g to be the mark of the beast that can't even happen okay the antichrist is not on the earth the spirit or the attitude or the nature antichrist means anything that's against christ himself anything that speaks truth and hope is and then that is the that is the truth but anything that speaks against it is an antichrist spirit jesus said even now the antichrist spirit is in the earth he didn't mean the person he met the way it will operate he will speak against god the antichrist will be against jesus christ his holiness his sovereignty it will speak totally against all of that that that stuff is going on but the antichrist himself has not been born how about that one people he's not on the earth because he couldn't operate in his fullness with the body of christ taking authority over the earth ruling and reigning on christ uh changing things speaking to things it wouldn't be able to be here he couldn't be here in the time when the antichrist comes the whole world will be falling apart millions of people will be missing off of the earth it will be a horrible experience for people and he will be their their protector he will be their savior the antichrist will have answers for all that stuff he's not here that stuff is not happening so no the mark of the beast is not out here somewhere but it will be a permanent visible mark and satan will make sure people want to take it back in the days of that happening and you will see it walking down the street he can't force you to take it people because it would defeat his purpose his purpose he wants to flaunt that people want him and they they want him to be there so this is not the time for any of that it's not the time of the four horses of the apocalypse it's not the time for the wormwood whatever to hit the earth it isn't time for death and destruction it isn't it is the time for the the knowledge and understanding and the operation of the glory the power of god seen going around the earth in these days there's baptism in fire that will burn all the fear out of you all the world out of you okay that has not happened yet okay the manifested sons and daughters speaking to earthquakes to make them stop and put it back the way it was before it happened or anybody died that's a manifested son or daughter raising the dead that were cremated that's a manifested son or daughter are you seeing that it's not even happening but we have to have this in the earth because she said it would be here and the wealth of the will the wealth of the wicked has to be transferred to the just and the righteous those things haven't even started stop asking if the mark of the beast is out there stop asking if this is the end and everything's going to crash and just be blown away it isn't and i have news for you the earth won't even stop being here until after the tribulation is over and it's done and gone they'll still be natural people on the earth jesus christ will sit on the throne in jerusalem for one thousand years when all of that is done and gone many of us will be in heaven okay and then the earth then jesus will be king of the world for one thousand years will be no wars no weapons will even be used saint will be in the bottomless pit just falling he will not even be on the earth there'll be no evil on the earth at the time there'll be people who don't want christ on the earth so you can see that even at the end of this age we're in which is still got quite a few generations to it the next age after this age will be the millennial age so the earth will still be here it'll still be operating it says people will still be getting married and being given a marriage so don't try to make god's will be pushed into a little box of what people have told you it will be this is not the last day this is not the perilous times where you can't build you can't eat there won't be anything to do you'll barely be able to breathe you won't see blue sky you won't even be here during that time you are here during some of the greatest days on the earth and i'm just going to end with this because it is so powerful to understand god's timing he has things in his own word he wrote if they're still in some of the newer bibles i hope they leave them in there the perilous times have not happened the tribulation has not happened it will not happen for quite a long time your focus is to know christ to have an intimate relationship to speak hope life create things invent things give people hope for a future not demon gloom okay god himself the father is the only one who decides when jesus comes back and he is too busy ruling and reigning with us okay so look for greatness look for god's plan for your life run after it don't sit him on the curb somewhere make sure he stays with you no holy spirit and know that you are chosen to be here now you are not chosen for wrath we as the body of christ have not been appointed unto wrath so we won't be here there will be people saved during the times of the tribulation those are other people who were not christians before that happened okay you focus on what he wants right now which is he wants you to be great for him in the earth bring hope and life watch your words watch your choices but live happy make sure you have fun because heaven is half fun and half powerful it's so filled with splendor glory and awe of god fun as a weapon against fun is a weapon when you're having fun the enemy doesn't like it so make sure you're using confusion too yes it confuses his head because he can't understand why he's not keeping you crushed down all right run after god himself and let god take care of all the rest of that stuff don't look for the mark of the beast it's not going to come in the letter it's not going to come in an email nobody can send it to you nobody can put it on you they can't force you to take it so you're not even in the generation that will be a part of that that means you are here to do powerful amazing things with him let your faith build trust god regardless of what's going on yes i've been through hard things before my life but i trusted him even when i had nothing i trusted him and believed his word and i told him i did bless his heart bless your angels heart by declaring the things of god it'll change the atmosphere where you live choose god choose life be powerful in the earth for him and we will see you later right jen [Music] yep [Music] you

for the heavens to be ripped open come on amen absolutely and uh you know well we love you we're going to be with you this weekend and so we're going to talk about this conference the washington glory major very soon so i'm so glad you're here on the show and and miss catker no introductions needed a one and only how are you doing ma'am welcome welcome i'm in a constant state of excitement right now that's what i'm doing i'm i'm feeling exactly what they're feeling in heaven they're excited about right now and what god's doing right now uh will touch and change this world for the next 100 years you know i'm just going to throw it out there because that's what the father does with me i can just tell you this is very key very important a lot of people maybe get trapped on the side about you know maybe violence or this going on but i can tell you god's got his plan and he's going to work it and it's going to be amazing and i just want to add this about the northwest did you not know the places that are the most significant to god are the ones that are attacked the most by the enemy and that's why satan wants to keep that area dry because it is like a wellspring i'm not just a well but a wellspring and i'm telling you god is going to explode from that area and come from that very corner of uh this country and flood all over the place so just stay excited everybody and don't miss it don't miss this event that's gonna happen wow that's powerful because uh you know you're talking about wellsprings and really i want to talk right now about the wellsprings of revival i believe we are in a season where god is re-digging or digging up the old wells like in the days of isaac yeah and he's also digging up new wells the old wells and the new wells and of course right now we're in the month of february it's it's my favorite uh month of the year why because it's my birthday month so welcome to february everybody but of course in this month uh catherine coleman passed uh billy graham pass john paul jackson bob jones and paul kane so i really feel like kat and sherelle did this season god wants us to dig up the old wells and the new whales of revival in america because we're in a new season now i want to ask you miss cat what do you think about that word and what god's doing and digging up the old wells and the new wells right now well i do know this that he's definitely in a generational thing right now which means the generations of the past and everything that they did and made as a foundation is going to explode in this in the generations of this uh time on the earth and those who are alive on the earth it's going to really it's going to accelerate everybody forward and upward and so yes i definitely agree with that the things that the people lay down their lives for i love it that in the month of love you know god took all those mighty men and women home and i actually knew bob jones would go home the father told me the birth of february and taking bob home on the 14th and he said it's going to open up whole new portals whole new gates all over this nation and he said so everybody needs to be excited and you know but that was several years ago but that doesn't matter god builds on things he knew everything that would happen and yet he's still gonna do everything he wants but this is what we'll have at the end we will have great victory and great celebration come on absolutely and i'm just being reminded miss cats of again bob jones prophetic word when the kansas city chiefs win the super bowl it will be a sign of world revival of the end times billions of harvests and of course last year the kansas city chiefs won after a long hiatus and it was a sign of course column drum you know uh you know with the dates and the coach and all of that but right now the kansas city chiefs are in the super bowl another time for the second consecutive year in a row awesome and i feel like again this is a double double sign double for your trouble sign that god is raising up the apostolic chiefs in america right now yeah you know and again i just love what you said miss cat that that mantle of the prophetic and of love of bob jones and of the kansas city prophets it's really coming down right now so strong yeah um wow my gosh and i i just want you miss cat if you could just pray into that right now in this moment because february is a month of love like you said but it's a month of mantles and a prophetic glory invasion can you just pray one thing one more second um the double thing totally goes into all of this because god started talking to me about the double uh divine decade divine decade uh and there's a double there's the 20 20 to 30 and the 30 to 40. this is going to stretch that long in this in this on this earth a lot here in america but god i thank you father for having your will your way this day that we're going to just skyrocket in this month of february god that people will see your love in our lives but also the true prophetic follow those with the true prophetic word god will step forward they may some be unknown some known but i know this is your time in the earth for for people to know you and to hear your word your true word which will excite people it will not be human gloom at all it's going to be your power your love your way in this earth and so by the way thank you for that and we come against anything of the enemy that would interfere or stop or halt or delay any of that in jesus name we say no more we command the host of heaven to go ahead and pull down every stronghold of satan trying to stop anything in this event keeping anyone from being a part of it we declare your power be seen and heard in this earth through the mouth of your prophets god we thank you for the mantles to be awakened god and those even carrying them to be brought alive in this time i thank you this is your time on the earth and we agree with your plan wow amen and amen absolutely i i feel like right now because of where our conversation's going i feel like we need to talk about what is god doing in this month of february what is god going to do in our country and in the nations of the earth that i just feel such an expectation and an anticipation because february is going to be a mega month of miracles so let's talk about that right now and i want to pass to mike in the florida prophetess sherelle what do you what do you sense what do you expect god to do in this month of february in this season right now well it's it just blew my mind that as soon as you guys got on here you started talking about the wells of revival i don't know if you guys know about a prophetess named fuchsia pickett but she was a prophetess back here in the 70s i believe and she i was reading some of her book last night and she was talking about how wellsprings of revival were going to burst up in certain areas of this uh of washington and this area over here and so i began to see a vision when i was reading that and i saw the lord show me that there's been like holes of revival in the grounds of the earth here and some people have sown seeds of faith and they've prayed and they've prepared the way and revival has come up to the surface a couple times but man put his foot on the coals man tried to stop the move of the holy spirit and what the lord is saying to me about these next few months is that we are going to be led by the spirit the spirit is going to lead us man is no longer going to lead the spirit and it's i'm i'm excited i just feel like the holy spirit what the lord showed me in 2017 he told me that the holy spirit will be given a platform and that's what we're seeing in this season a place that is cultivating revival by letting the holy spirit lead amen and you know just uh just to piggyback on that you know really the next three months i want you to hear these words because the next three months there's going to be monumental momentum that's going to take place from now passover i wish somebody heard me today from today february 1 to passover which is of course in the middle of april for the next three months there's going to be mega momentum monumental momentum that's going to shift you into harvest and into miracles so there's going to be a lot of setup for financial miracles miracles in your business and even salvation in your family but from now to passover begin to prepare because there's going to be mega setups for your divine breakthrough now before i pass the mic over uh to the woman of god cancur i just want to read the scripture because we're talking about whales because i believe god is springing up wells right now in the spirit genesis 26 18 isaac reopened someone said reopened which means it was closed but he opened up again isaac reopened the wells that had been dug up in the time of his father abraham which the philistines ding ding ding key were philistines which are enemy opposing giants the giants of the land the giants of welfare of poverty of socialism the giants of human trafficking of the elitist the philistines had stopped the whales after abraham died and so right now these giants of the land of 201 are trying to stop the wells or stop the flow of your finances stop the flow of the holy spirit stop the flow of revival but god wants to anoint you to dig up and open up again what has been closed by these philistines these opposing giants and god's going to be doing it from today february 1st all the way to passover so you watch god's about to open up miss cat what are your thoughts here what do you want to say to the people right now i i have to say exactly what the father is continually saying to me don't we don't lose that um that spirit of celebration and maybe you don't know this people but celebrating in heaven is mainly what they do it's one of the ways they worship god it's one of the ways they are are thankful and grateful to him for all the things that they that he did for us while we were on earth and also once they get to heaven and so they are celebrating in heaven already and i do know another prophet uh hank kuhneman who always talks about january february and march that leads into april and he is almost in line with what you're saying he says that january will begin to bring justice february will be all the fireworks of the beginning of everything happening and then marching into the end of the march will be great celebration and miraculous so uh that's what he has heard from god i can tell you that i continually hear that justice is already beginning to be served and all the stuff that's going on and just let me add what the father just shared with me yesterday about all the stuff going on we know that those who are now sitting in seats of authority are illegitimate that's what the father says is illegitimate power in other words not power given in the natural not power given in the spirit you know the whoever is the head of a government it says that when the righteous are in power the people rejoice but when it's the wicked and the evil are that great the sadness comes upon them well i need to remind everybody that right now those who are in authority don't have power not real power which will be shown and proven when that great victory comes and god will shift back what his intentions always were and the truth is this the one who is in true authority even right now yeah which is trump he is actually a president he did win the election and he is the one in authority still welcoming god still having plans by the way he's still getting ready to work plans i just have to let you all know that and it's beginning to be no secret that that's happening so there's a lot of people right now in dc very afraid demons are leaving dc like crazy i mean they're just leaving racing out of there and this is what god said that is because it's illegitimate power so those who are righteous right now they are still in power they're the ones in power and what he says what our president says the true president says is what will affect this cup this country not just in the natural but in the spirit realm this is what the father says the wicked and evil trying to rule they have no power no true power so they have no right no portals open to them to allow evil to flood this country like people think is happening i'm sorry but the devil isn't going to be taking over because there's no true portal or opening you have for that to happen that is shut you should be rejoicing everybody because this is going to be an accelerated thing that begins to happen with the revival going into the habitation of god in this in this country and all over the world actually so these are celebrator times these are victorious times these are not times to be crushed and to be sad and to have fear in you about the only thing the devil's getting away with is bringing fear all those regulations and all those laws being made illegal illegitimately will not stand yes well this is why you should be celebrating because we will have the ability to move unhindered all open country as god moves and does the victory thing and you will see it with your eyes everybody will see it with your eyes this is why it's so important to come to these events right now to get filled up to get excited to begin to make plans with god himself about what your part will be in this so this is a strategic event you don't want to miss this this event because this is god's time to bring in that double decade the divine decades uh back to back in this in this country here and it's going to be so powerful your life won't be the same we don't want it to go back exactly the way it was we want it to be greater more powerful in god that we will be more accelerated forward and the law will flow in this country especially between the body of crisis was really needed first and i declared that that love will be released because the other can't be hell can't be released right now people if you get me in the spirit room if you were a or you would understand it's leaving hell is leaving and so that leaves those who want to be in power power less they won't have the effects they won't have the enticement they won't have that uh the captivation of hell and evil although it's already in them it will not be released or lose throughout this land because there's been no portals open because the one in true authority is not allowing it come on that's so good and of course the wells are actually portals because wells one more thing there are these massive angels some of the hosts have already been sent to some of these wells and they have these swords probably they're 15 feet high swords and they're like standing there like this over them about to hit them when we declare something at this event they will hit these wells these drywalls and they will literally be open and they'll shoot on springs so this is a specific event planned by god so this can happen so don't miss being a part of uh having those wells open can i share something with you really quick uh that's what i was seeing in the spirit when i was beginning to pray and see you coming over to this area i saw you just taking a stake and driving it into the ground and it just broke open this area and i saw the wells begin to bubble up and the the springs just begin to spring forth throughout the earth in this area and it just goes all the way from this side all the way down into the east coast and i just believe it's going to start something here in this area that has not been done before i'm so we are so excited well absolutely the convergence that happens when the right anointings and mantles come together and and times uh you do not receive a breakthrough because there's an element that's missing but i believe again us coming together especially with miss cat especially with the now anointing and the now word that she carries sun is gonna break open in the pacific northwest so listen people of god you need to be there at this event i mean we're pretty much sold out i don't know if we can do overflow open up the doors and have people just sitting outside we may have to do that honestly because we're already sold out uh but you know there's going to be something powerful that's going to be released that's going to affect all the regions of states nearby i guarantee it i believe witches are going to come to jesus yeah people who are in new age are going to be delivered okay to warlocks weekends people moving in the dark and black magic and dark spirits they're they're going to feel the tremors of the wealth opening up so it's going to be powerful um you know again as we're talking about all this again what god is doing in america right now on the earth what god is doing from now february all the way to april passover and now specifically for this conference this event the washington glory invasion you know i'm just reminded of again uh uh john g lake how he started up the healing whales and the healing rooms in spokane washington and you know there's something supernatural that happens in the pacific northwest and i believe something's going to break with that mantle now prophet shirelle is there something you want to share with us concerning john g lake the healing rooms and that well of revival that's about to burst open i just know that we are getting close we have been seeing more miracles than ever before in our second service we had a man come in and walk out of a wheelchair i mean when taylor ran up to me and she was like mom there's someone outside in a wheelchair and i was going oh my gosh not a wheelchair on my second service but it was incredible it's just awesome to be pioneering here what has been in god's heart for so long and i just what i'm seeing is that this explosion that's gonna happen no man can keep his foot on it then the holy spirit is getting ready to explode in this area i believe we're going to see miracles like never before i believe we're going to see limbs growing out more blind eyes and deaf ears being healed but not only that families being healed god is calling whole families in this season he's calling the prodigals home and i'm so excited to see and be a part of this movement and it's like god is strategically placing people the right people together people that probably really never wanted to do anything like this i don't know about you cat but i was just minding my own business when the fire of god fell on me in my living room and he told me to go live on facebook and i was like you want me to do what so i just believe that god is raising up a remnant in this season in this hour he's the people that he's bringing to the hub here are just so hungry and they're tired of church they're tired of religion they're tired of being put in a box i took the box slacks last week and i ripped it in half and i threw it and i stomped on it during the circuit because i just believe you know when we're led by the holy spirit it's powerful yes it is we give him the platform and he does it all it takes the pressure off of us and we just give him the reigns and we say have your way holy spirit and i believe that's people like john g lakes that's what he did he probably surrendered his life to the holy spirit and that's why god used him so mightily and that's what we're seeing right now and another thing is i feel like you know um god's using the most unlikely people yeah and people that are not really that well liked people don't like cats pink hair people don't like my pink lipstick but i'm just being obedient to god and just saying use me lord i surrender my life to you and he's gonna he's gonna do something in this area that we have not seen we are getting ready to see something that we have never seen i mean what are the odds of the kansas city chiefs going to the super bowl for a second time yeah that's incredible well well once again god god is the god of the miraculous and he's the god of the double and the triple so i believe in the season just like prophet shirelle said that the unlikely the no names the faceless those that objected looked down upon i mean president donald j trump took took it by storm and he came totally from left uh from the left side from you know left wing but again it's those types of people where there will be a supernatural grace to be an apostolic chief like the kansas city chiefs god's raising of apostolic chiefs prophetic warriors in the season who carry the now word of god and who walk in signs and wonders yeah uh of course we're talking about this event uh you know we're all going to be together literally in a few days i know my cities uh talk to us what are you expecting for this event it's really not even an event but it's it's a family celebration it is because it's actually an encounter um yes god doesn't always call things events anymore he calls them encounters and those who are there or who choose to encounter what he's got those are the ones who will go away with it to use it to release it for him but something else about john g lake um i remember one time when i was i was under attack that was probably maybe 12 14 years ago when all that happened and i was heading to memphis to um release elvis's mantle to be completed because it wasn't completed and then he bought me every way i could that's how important mantles are they're so important and i i told my husband knows throw me in the back of the truck there was a double cab and margaret drove all the way there and we were listening to um billy brims tapes about had all those who had passed on before she had recorded things and i think john g lake's son-in-law was speaking and he was talking about um speaking in tongues and i'm telling you it started to get really hot it was so hot and all of a sudden the holy spirit said i want you to claim it and so he was speaking under the anointing of the lightning power of god that was one of the things john d like operated in it just blasts the enemy out it's still a part of the fire of god and god said claim your healing and i yelled i couldn't speak up until that point it said i i claim it and all of a sudden a fire came through the speaker hit me at the end of my feet when i went my body and drove the sickness out and i was instantly and i was on fire it started getting so hot in the cab and i know the holy spirit was just laughing he was so celebrating see because i out of an act of obedience i was just dared to do it and when we got to the event when we got to the this place in memphis where i was speaking about albus and why god called him and anointed him and was talking about that mantle then people ran forward to get prayer the holy spirit said impart the fire of the lightning power of god into them i'm like when did i get that and he said you said you received it and i said i thought i received him and he said oh you have the mantle of the lightning power of god that john g lake operated in and since that day i have used that lightning power god it destroys the works of darkness no matter what is about and i did it so much so many times john g lake actually showed up at my event there you could see by several people who were present and he was just watching me release the lightening power of god i can tell you what's going to be the lighting power of god is going to be at that event people and it destroys the warts of darkness in your life in cities and regions and i mean no guess what it's probably going to show up there probably john g lake that's where he's from and so expect the lightning power of god expect the miraculous to happen and i do expect things to happen that never happened before so it's going to be a power a power encounter of god of holy spirit of jesus of this whole area being least at least released into its destiny to bring the life and the power of god into this country and then throughout the world so this is a major encounter time on god's timeline so please don't miss being there because we are all a part of this when we come into agreement great power is released wow that is so powerful that's why uh you know as myself and prophet shiro we prayed about a title for this encounter you know uh the washington glory invasion because the lightning angels of course the thunders and lightnings from his throne are actually angelic hosts that are being released from his throne okay those angels are going to be invading and they're they're already invading right now those angels are going to be invading this time and i believe right now even from that event conference region to wherever you're going to be connected or watching from to be a new measure of power a new measure of these mantles a new measure of healing don't be afraid of kobe don't be afraid of vaccinations don't be afraid of what the world says there's a new wave of miracle working power and healing as being so we're going to tap into something it's going to be incredible i can't wait to just celebrate the lord and and just to party with heaven all together it's going to be incredible um now uh of course right now uh as we're about to bring this broadcast to a close but uh we want to pray for you people of god we're

those times that god actually does do a new thing and that's why we've all been feeling that and i know i feel i feel what y'all are feeling ben and i feel what you're feeling that god is going to do some new things never done before and it's going to be one of those suddenlies it is a suddenly and it will spring forth and it will happen as we're all together and yes and i when i look like a look at this camera right now i'm not just seeing a camera i see people in the world i see masses of people so hungry drawing that anointing that is in me i can feel actually leaving me now even though this is a like you know a recording uh i just already know that god's gonna do something powerful and i love that god will start in some of the most unexpected places because that's just who he is he'll use the things that have been abandoned or overlooked or stopped or delayed or halted there will be no more delay in these days no more delay god's going to move forward he's going to move quickly and i tell people make sure you're on the right train right make sure you're going in the right direction if you got off get back on don't give up don't step back this is a season to go

to share truth and then take us back to you we thank you god that we will be in all of eternity with you it'll go from glory to glory splendor to splendor the wonder of you inside of us i thank you for the father and everyone said amen amen wow this is an awesome atmosphere thank you for coming everyone the only thing i like more about going to heaven is sharing it i can't teach you how to do that i have a commission to do that i can tell you that he is catching people up all over this world and showing them his home for christ said in my father's house are many mansions and i can assure you that his house is not a building it's not a platform somewhere in the sky it is a world bigger than our galaxy even bigger than that there's no way you can measure it or even understand how he designed it it's always been his home until the day he makes the new earth and then we all have a home together i don't know if you realize this is actually willing to leave his own home to live with us christ had to leave it when he became down to earth and he became flesh had flesh put him he died on the cross the holy spirit moved his base of operations here because christ sent him here and then one day the father himself will leave heaven and forever live on the new earth with all of us in that amazing that they had to be willing to do all of that for us that's because he loves you that's because you actually came from him everyone who ever existed came from him you didn't live somewhere in heaven you lived in him he was your very world the enemy is always trying to copycat what god has he wants to be god that's never going to happen it didn't happen back in the ancient times when he was thrown out of heaven when he was so convinced he convinced himself he had won he got a third of the angels on his side which still is almost it makes you undone to think about that doesn't it they lived with the god who made them and yet they chose a creation over the creator and let me tell you just because god didn't say anything to him didn't mean that he didn't know about it but the more he deceived and the more god remained silent he thought that he had won he thought he was smarter than god and then he found out in a second he wasn't anything he wasn't anything he was kicked out of heaven all the angels were kicked out with him they can never be restored and i know you may hear people preach that one day god will forgive everybody that everyone will go to heaven he'll forgive lucifer he'll forgive the fallen angels that will not ever happen their future is already sealed in the lake of fire they will not be anywhere near us on the new earth it says the former things will be remembered no more in heaven right now though you give testimony of your life and the victory that god gave you on this earth when you get to heaven but one day none of the things that that were a part of your life are without him well you will not even be able to remember them but i will tell you right now even on this earth we will become so supernatural like him let's say this together god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the earth that's his plan for you so people say that we can't be like him they're wrong he would have never said that and in case you didn't know after the likeness is the way they operate so he didn't just make you in his image he gave you things inside of you so that you could operate like him so who is he he's a creator right jesus christ is a commander is that right holy spirit goes every knows everything all at the same time holy spirit is an unlimited layered being don't you like revelation he has unlimited layers of himself and every layer of him is a whole of him so wherever he sends a layer of himself he knows everything everywhere all at the same time so for your information when you invite holy spirit to indwell you you don't get a little piece of him he sends a layer of himself which is a whole of him who indwells you and that is what makes you the temple of the holy spirit that is one of the most important things you can do after you get born again it's not even preached in some places right now you know because the enemy is terrified of that happening to you because then instead of walking beside you it says the word when you get born again he comes alongside you is that right and he'll be there all the time until you're caught up to heaven one day unless you do something about it unless you choose to ask him to indwell you you have to invite him say we must invite say we had to invite christ to indwell us we have to invite holy spirit to indwell us it's heaven protocol and the reason for that is you had to make a choice you chose with your will to receive christ and let me tell you we actually have a new cd card born again that the father had me just make it tells you what happened in the spirit realm what happened in eternity in the scrolls of time and the lamb's book of life in hell and inside your very being that made you the new creation what happened at that time at that moment in time and it's on this cd called born again it's one of the best witnessing tools i've ever had or ever made it explains why christ why do you have to receive him what happens when you receive him what levels you can go after after that happens what happens when holy spirit indwells you what happens all around you what happens with the host of heaven what happens with your guardian angel this if you're not aware of the spirit realm the unseen realm i'm talking about the unseen realm it says everything that was made that you see was made by that which was unseen that means the unseen realm is the original realm not this physical realm this physical realm is temporal it's temporary that's what that means but eternity is in this in the spirit realm there's more activity in the spirit realm than there is in the scene realm there's it never stops activity never stops in the unseen realm not around you not around where you live not in the atmosphere not into the third heavens there's continual activity both from heaven and from hell and what you do in your life will draw one or the other to you that's why you need discernment that's why you need holy spirit that's why you need to pursue an intimate relationship with jesus christ there's a lot of stuff going on in this world today even in the body of christ that shouldn't be happening there's a lot of good and there's a lot of god i'm not going to discount that because god is pouring himself more and more into this world christ is making himself known to us every day of our life you can increase in that relationship with him because he wants that kind of relationship with you he's not sitting on the sideline watching your life go by no he armed us when you were born again you got weapons you got the anointing you got authority given to you because you you are now a son of the living god your son or daughter of the living god and what you do with your life after you receive him is totally up to you but right now living on this earth are many that he called to demonstrate for him in the greater works that christ talked about they're beyond your imagination to even consider or think you might actually get to do some of that like going to a funeral and raising someone the dead that was cremated [Music] i hope i got someone's attention everybody say that's a greater work people think well you know lazarus was dead for four days correct that's in the scriptures he was dead he was stinking his body was stinking mary and martha we're trying to show christ it is too late let me tell you christ did not cry because lazarus died he said it was going to be okay didn't he yeah because he knew who he was you know he cried because they didn't believe it they were doubting him he had said yeah he'll be resurrected yes we know on the day that the dead in christ is raised he'll be raising who's trying to say no right now you know he was there right he knew what was going to happen let me tell you people in abraham's bosom were shocked do we ever think of that how many people don't know what abraham's bosom was let me see your hand it's okay if you don't know a lot of places don't teach that anymore before christ died on the cross and descended into hell and wiped up hell went up to heaven and poured out his blood on the mercy seat when people when righteous people died that god called righteous they descended into abraham's bosom which was a spiritual abode god made for his friends they didn't sit on rocks it was a spirit round place it had golden buildings it had a sky it had a magnificent river it had king's tables filled with feasts for them to partake of and below that was hell and there was a great gulf between them this is what the word says and those in hell right inside the gates of hell you come up to the courtyard of hell you could see up into abraham's bosom but you couldn't go there they could see them if they came close to there was like um i'm trying to think of the word my mind's not in the natural realm at all right now i like a balcony reigning thank you holy spirit in this beautiful place he'd made for abraham isaac jacob joseph who raised jesus right john the baptist was there is that true yes because they were righteous they were kind of righteous either because they believed in god himself and they extended their faith for that when they died they went there they didn't they didn't descend into hell that was for the wicked dad but they could see each other at one point and so people in abraham's bosom already knew the messiah was on the earth as soon as joseph went there they knew because he wouldn't stop talking about it if you knew that and you went there would you talk about it yeah he nonstop talked about it and then when john the baptist went who was his cousin he confirmed everything joseph said but he even knew more because he was there after joseph he was still there living on the earth after joseph went and descended abraham's wisdom so then john the baptist was talking about him he actually saw him right he baptized him he wouldn't stop talking i have baptized the messiah he is here on the earth he's here so they already knew in abraham's wisdom the messiah was on the earth so let me tell you when he showed up there they knew who he was and he proved who he was because he himself left for the first time left abraham's bosom and crossed over into hell on his own because he had an assignment it was to take back our authority and our dominion that god had given you know had given adam and eve and then they they sold out but you know what they were redeemed yes they're in heaven say yay adam and eve are in heaven how about that they made it so sometimes you don't really think about the whole scope of this picture and so as someone else came to abraham's bosom they would tell them what was going on on the earth because they were new the new arrivals and it's just like in heaven when somebody newly arrives they'll chase you down they'll start getting you the minute you come in the gate and you're standing trying to jump in the river they're like okay what about this whatever this is i heard this was going on what about this is this true now i saw something from the portal but i didn't know all about so why don't you why don't we go share somewhere they want to haul you off somewhere and share with you they want to hear what i want to hear what you have to say and later you're going to have meetings every one of your family members had to stand on a platform and share to the body of christ living in heaven about their life how god redeemed them what was going on around them and then what was newly invented on the earth they won every time somebody new comes they want to know i promise you it was exact same in abraham's bosom okay you don't get a chance to do that when you go to hell okay you have no life in hell been there and seen it you don't want to go there there's people right now saying there is no help they may find out one day there are there definitely is it talks about it in the word it exists it's there but in abraham's bosom life was amazing it was beautiful they had feasts to eat you don't get anything in hell there will be no food in hell i love that one song that says they don't see they don't serve breakfast in hell if you haven't heard it i think isn't it uh it's called like my father's house isn't that the name of the song but yeah big big house is big big house and they are telling people you won't get breakfast in hell you don't but abraham's bosom had more than enough and plenty they needed to enjoy their life they were always excited when somebody knew came there and most of the time they didn't have to ask them they came there talking about it especially once the son of god and the messiah was on the earth that was the number one subject they wanted to know about i know i was taken there i saw abraham's bosom it wasn't some little tiny hovel on a rock people picture them sitting in the middle of the earth you know trying to escape the lava the spirit realm supersedes this physical realm that's why spiritual beings can pass through the walls they can walk through you your angel stands in you most of the time yeah they sit on you too sometimes especially if you ever get out on the floor if you're knocked out by the spirit of god or the glory whatever it is that gets you on that floor and you can't move your angel is sitting on you you can't even crawl i've been there i'd see them sit on me and they wouldn't get up and all i could do was laugh i mean i couldn't crawl like tell my family don't bother me until i can crawl up to the you know alter leave me there you'll find out one day everything they did okay for you and to you but there was big news in abraham's bosom about the messiah once lazarus came he was dead for four days where do you think he was he was the newest thing in abraham's bosom and that man who was one of christ's best friends knew beyonce who he was he would not stop talking about the messiah and here he is like into his starting his fourth day there just going full steam ahead wham [Applause] they lost their messenger they heard a voice [Music] lazarus heard him he heard him calling him from there did you think he was going to say no i'm busy later when i'm done oh he did not care okay he called him to come forth he came out of abraham his spiritual body came at abraham's bosom back into the tomb picked up his body and he came out of that tomb still in the wrappings and he wasn't stinking [Laughter] because he was fresh alive by the glory of god raised up from the dead to be a miraculous demonstration of the power of jesus christ which has been given to you and i you should see it that way we are joint heirs with him what he did on this earth we have the ability if we walk in and go after it to do that he said that we have the ability to raise the dead right heal the sick raise the dead cast out demons is that right trump is supposed to you're right you're supposed to follow us if you believe you got to remember that there are requirements to all those who believe right these shot these signs shall follow them and so here was christ demonstrating it doesn't matter how long it doesn't matter if your dad you don't have you know no matter if you died right then raise him up no he was dead for four days so if we're gonna do greater works that means it has to be something greater than being dead for four days but he didn't mean being dead for seven days he meant when you were ashes i i was taken forward in time and i literally was shown this is one of the greater works and christ took me there and i saw somebody raising someone from the dead at a funeral that had been cremated and everyone in the funeral home ran down front through their face on the floor and began to cry out to jesus christ [Music] and i i am absolutely what he shows me is literal he doesn't show me symbolic things ever he treats me like i may he says i'm going to show you so you know what i'm talking about that is something that will happen i'm sure it will go viral around the earth so the knowledge of the glory sometimes will go through the internet [Music] did you think about that that's something worth watching over a few times isn't it people watch laughing dogs 10 million times and i want to point out no matter what tragedies and stuff are going on out there the laughing dogs top all the doom and gloom and the wicked evil stop because people want something that they're going to enjoy so why don't you give them something to enjoy your testimony should be filled with glory power right victory that's the word of your testimony you overcome with that that's not the story of your doom and gloom and and 10 hours of your sufferings that's a story a testimony is how you were tested and you got victory and christ gets all the glory for it he actually told me to tell you if you're writing a book about your life make sure he gets more than 10 pages because it won't be worth reading if you make people suffer along with you through your entire life and at the end you give an ounce of victory that doesn't show them that they can overcome even during the in the midst of what they're going through you should have victory every day of your life because he delivers us out of it all right so start giving him the victory the minute you step into something start declaring you have victory you're giving him the glory it's because of him not you that you are an overcomer because your words have power if you don't remember anything else remember to watch your words what do you want in your life what do you want in your family's life what do you want right now in your life because what you say is what you're going to get the word says you'll eat the fruit of your lips is that right whatsoever you will have whatsoever you say it loud you should have whatsoever you i think that means your words are important he made me count my words one time every time i opened my mouth i had to think about what i was going to say he trained me to speak life and not negative not negative unless he shows me something that he has said i am to be aware of and to not be a part of i don't run around spending my life critiquing everybody else's life and pointing out all their weaknesses because you're not helping them when you do that you're not you need to talk about people's strengths their gifts right god's plans for them share the truth with them while you're doing it because they're going to open they're going to be open for you to speak to them if you're encouraging them not blasting them and i also know that you help the enemy when you blast them it's like you're part of the enemy's camp this is my assignment to tell them how wicked and evil they are how far they have fallen from god that they're walking in hopelessness they'll never have anything no that is the enemy's words that's how he talks if you hear that don't say it if you hear those words turn around go i know who you are and i'll have nothing to do with you you'll freak him out because most people just say what he says right so if we're going to be like christ in the earth we have to be careful what we say how we live the choices that we make in our life your soul is fed every minute of the day by what you say what people say to you what you watch what you hear and places you go your soul is going to be whatever this is the way god said whatever you enter into is going to enter into you that's a quote a quote from heaven what you enter into will enter into you that means in your soul and that's important because you are a living soul we've all said you know we have we you know we we we we're a body we are a spirit we have a soul no you are a soul you are a soul wrapped in your spirit man and you have flesh on your body so you can have dominion in the earth but you are a soul and you choose whether it prospers or not if you want to prosper and be in health then you guard what goes in your soul you can change the way you think the way you respond even what happens to you tomorrow by what you decide tonight to do with your soul you can't take your soul and set it on a shelf and pretend like it's something bad because when i grew up in in denominational churches they always said the soulless realm is bad your soul is bad well then how come it got saved [Laughter] i was eight and i would have all these big questions for people that they didn't want to answer if my soul just got saved right he came to save souls right if i gave it to jesus and he moved in then why is my soul bad i don't think anything bad i'm not looking at bad stuff i mean just only eight years old but they made decisions when i was young i was going to be in the side of my parents i was going to be on god's side you know i was going to help him he needed help so i really consider what i do with my life even when i was young i did so i escaped even though i was raised as a teenager and the whole drug thing when it first came out by by the way marijuana is bad no matter what they tell you that's from heaven he did not make it so you could smoke it i don't care if it is a natural plant i will preach it i grew up in that time when it first came well in my era when it first came people lost jobs they lost friendships they got sucked into lsd and all the other drugs i didn't do any of it i decided at 15 i was having nothing to do with it and i wasn't participating so i still have all my brain i'm in great help because i never participated in the drug thing i didn't need anybody else's approval i wasn't part of a clique i didn't know that peer pressure bothered me actually i tried to talk all my friends in high school well my acquaintances i didn't have a lot of friends i had i had a tribe at home i would tell them i'll look right um i said you're nuts for taking this stuff you're gonna burn your brain cells up you know what are you gonna become you can't even think right and people got i think i think 60 out of 600 seniors uh od'd in my senior class off from drugs and all of them started on marijuana every single one of them they actually give it to you free they give it to you free get you hooked up then they bring something stronger to you that's how it works i was in the elevator in the hotel and i heard a young man he had come here on business to meet with some business people here and he was saying on the phone not knowing who i was we blasted him with the anointing the whole time was there when he left he said oh yeah i had a great time my business meeting were very productive and he said these people were they were real real with me we drank and we smoked some i knew what he meant okay he didn't need it for medicinal purposes but these were leaders in a business community that gave it to this young man that's not even ethical it's not right he hadn't even had it before but that's the enemy's plan and he was saying man this was an amazing experience in my mind i'm thinking devil you are not getting that person man i was standing right now releasing the anointing him he walked out the door we sent the host of heaven upon all the strongholds of the demonic the addictive demonic to pull that stronghold off of him and pull it off of him and we were sending on the glory after him the anointing after him to break the yoke of darkness off of him and went god i am not tolerating this i'm not tolerating it and people well jesus didn't he said he talked about any kind of pharmacia that was drugs even back in his day they had them he talked about necromancers have nothing to do with the necromancer that is witchcraft there's no good witches and there's people that really think there are there are no good witches warlocks wizards magicians there was not one magician in the bible that was good and we're sitting here we've been so consumed with society and the world itself that we've accepted a lot of stuff but let me tell you he never accepted it so we need to take a good long look at ourself and say where am i where am i and what god has called me to be what he what he showed me i am what christ gave me how did he walk what did he do we had braces forever what would jesus do not a lot of what goes on now because if we're witnesses our life's supposed to be a witness right you didn't know you were going to come to church tonight because i'm saving the good stuff for next all those in abraham's bosom they lived a righteous life according to receiving god okay they believed who he was they believed when he spoke they believed they followed him and what he said and so they were kind of righteous so they were they descended in abraham's bosom but the minute lazarus showed up they knew something was going to happen on the earth not just to them they knew somebody changed for them because their messiah had come they knew it they knew something would be manifested in the earth and it certainly was maybe not what they expected but let me tell you when christ himself showed up a little while later with the thief from the cross because when christ gave up his spirit he'd still be hanging there by the way he didn't no one killed him he laid down his life he actually had to make his spirit man leave his body he himself loosed it from his body yeah that's going to be in a movie one day and then you will see in the movie christ descending into abraham's bosom him sharing the good news with them all receiving him as christ as their savior and let me tell you when the spear men entered into that ground there was such an upheaval that they themselves walked on the earth that were in abraham's bosom go read the scripture they were seen walking on the earth is that crazy you'd think they'd get a hint right okay uh that one's from a hundred years ago 300 years ago he's walking on here something's going on down there [Music] and christ wasn't numb because then he was going to go wreck hal my favorite one of my favorite times was when they took me when they took me down into hell and i was there on the third day when christ wasted them [Music] it will be in a movie [Laughter] [Applause] not even a world-class movie a heaven-class movie that will be produced on this earth by the best of the best with the best special effects that will get people undone everywhere and they'll know what happened there's actually a demand in hollywood they want to know what happened between the cross and when he when he went back to heaven they want to know they want to know what happened [Music] now when he went back when when his disciples saw him ascending into heaven he'd already been there did you know that because when he came out of the grave what did he tell mary i must go to my [Music] my father and your father right yeah because he had to pour out his blood on the mercy seat in heaven so when he said it was finished on the cross that meant that every a sacrifice for all sin for all time was once and for all never again would something have to be sacrificed for sin you would never again go to the temple once a year to get forgiven did you know that they went once a year to get forgiven okay then they tried to do their best all year they go back again and then heavenly sacrifices they had this whole thing that god had shown them to do and then uh there's all kinds of things you need to go back and read it anyway that's the way you got forgiven that's what that's what freaked out all the high priest when john the baptist started saying you know repent of your sins the kingdom of heaven is at hand well they never heard that before that's why they didn't like him so when new revelation comes to the earth there's always upheaval and you're hearing the new what is the new that means new things will happen new ways will happen new words will happen you're living in a time like that right now yeah because we'll be ruling and reigning with christ this is a whole new time that was a new time a fullness of time has come that was the fullness of time so christ was wreaking heaven on the earth before he ever went into hell then he really wiped up because hell thought they thought they had won the second time satan had a brain freeze honestly he did the father said he lost something in his mind when he fell yeah part of his memory banks because he still thinks even now he's going to win he's already been defeated well he was he's totally defeated but i mean god kicked him out of heaven he didn't win them when he was going to take over and go inside the father and rule from inside the father and be over all the people the people weren't on the earth yet that was us inside god he knew we were in there isn't that interesting he knew about us for a very long time he didn't know who we were he knew we were important he knew we weren't angels because god didn't just speak and make us we lived in him forever until he made this earth time space plan to send us here and when he made adam's body when the word made adam's body and the father leaned over and breathed adam's spiritual being his spirit of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul uh the enemy was right there watching because he was thrown on the earth remember yeah he was watching he knew where that came from he knew that was somebody that came from inside god and then he was not well one way he wasn't happy because now god was sending them which would mean a lot of trouble for him if they ever found out who they were so god had a plan when he sent us people it was to be like him on the earth to take authority over all the power of the enemy crush him push him back take our rightful place that christ won for us he died for your sins but he went into hell to get back your authority that adam had given away because he was righteous and they had no right to hold him so abraham's bosom was ready to see a show and hell was ready to put on a show but there's only one person who put a show on and made a show of it openly and that was the son of the living god [Applause] if you if you don't think they like a show up there you don't know them because god put on a show wasn't that a show when he sent lightning bolts from himself and took satan out right and then one-third of the angels were all kicked out the same way they were celebrating in heaven because they had had it up to here with lucifer i don't know anyone in heaven that cried when he was kicked out the gabriel did not cry and michael certainly did not cry because from that moment on he knew who the enemy was because before that happened there was no enemy heaven was a delightful place it was a wonderful place it was perfect in every way even lucifer was perfect in all his ways until iniquity was found in him and that was that he was greater than god and he was going to take over that didn't happen either so he was kicked down to earth and decided well i'm just going to take over here on this nice place i'll just take over here let me tell you what happened when he first made those plans that didn't work either because then god brought the ice age and he was sitting on a block of ice you got to picture this this is reality movie from heaven when he was first cast out of heaven the dinosaurs were on the earth there was there was no sin on the earth there was no darkness on this there's no evil on the earth okay he brought that with him he began to make it a wilderness the dinosaurs began to kill each other because in the beginning they didn't i saw him i saw the earth when he made it the first time the dinosaurs walked with the watcher angels they left footprints the angels in the ground and scientists are still trying to figure out how they can make it into cavemen because they have blocks of like stone with a put a human footprint they think and dinosaur prince god put water angels on the earth to care for them watch your angels yeah they had flesh on them this is a reality movie this is reality movie night and they were here to care for the dinosaurs and god said well i'm not tolerating this anymore you know he's going to take over the earth so god broke the water vapor shield that covered the earth to put mist on the ground so the dinosaur skin wouldn't fall off there had been no storms on the earth at one point until of course they heard cracks of lightning and then here comes all the other stuff on the earth he began to make it a wilderness god wasn't going to tolerate it so the water vapor shield he put around the earth which every one of your family members has already seen this in heaven you go into this place called creation lab and god recorded all of it you get to actually see how he made the heavens and the earth they know how all of it happened isn't that amazing so everybody gets to find that out they know a whole lot up there and so yeah so god broke the water of april shield it flooded the earth until he covered the whole earth and then he blew on it and froze it and there is satan with all of his plans washed down the tubes again because now he's got a block of ice and he can do nothing on it and there's the ice age somebody didn't enjoy it god removed his glory off the earth and it said darkness covered the earth and then we have verse two [Music] that was all in verse one then comes verse two and darkness was on the face of the deep right the spirit of god was hovering over the waters is that correct over the waters he didn't say there was ground over the waters because in the beginning he made it and it was good he created in the beginning of time and space he made this plane to earth and it was finished it was finished and it was good create ted he created that was past tense right and then we come to verse two so something happened between those two verses a whole lot because then he starts to take it apart and put it back together is that what he says yes there was water on everything water on the sky water on the land he took the water off the firmament that was the air that was the sky that was in the ground of the ground i'm doing my motions again people my staff say don't do that my hands move okay i can't we help it he began to take it apart it clearly explains to you what he did right so he was going to recreate the earth or he would not have told the animals to replenish the earth did you get that word re that's like you remodel your home you can't remodel a home that was never there you can't replenish the earth if it wasn't there before so that's what he did everybody in heaven has already seen everything i'm telling you about he began to take everything apart right so that he could then redo the earth and then he began to make the animals and all the life back on the earth all the growth was back on the earth again and then he did something different than he hadn't done before he was going to make man in that amazing and then there was the word stepped out of the father began to form adam's body and he looks pretty good i've seen adam and eve in heaven yes they have clothes and yes you will have clothing you actually get a wardrobe he can afford more than two garments for you aren't you glad [Music] i get asked that question all the time you well your soul's exposed on your shoes though the soul's exposed yeah ask somebody what the sole your foot is if you need help just take your shoe off and look at it the soles exposed on your on the bottom of your foot you're always touching the ground to heaven they still have boots they have sandals they have all kinds of shoes there to wear beautiful things amazing things and some of them talk to you your clothing will change colors and your clothes will change on you while you're walking down the street if you cannot decide what you should have worn and you picked out three things as you walk each one will come on you women [Applause] heaven is not normal concerning this earth it's heaven where eye has not seen your ear heard or entered in the heart or mind of me and god's prepared for those that love him except in the last it's revealed by thee spirit of god so that means it can be revealed right he's doing that at an accelerated rate and he's shown me a lot on purpose so he wasted hell i'm going to go back to the third day that's okay he wasted hell the first day christ goes well i'm not going to touch him on wait and see if god rescues him and he didn't come and he had taken him into the they had grabbed and put him in the far reaches not the outer reaches i've seen there too you don't want to know about the outer reaches of hell okay the far reaches of hell they dragged him back what good is that going to do if the god of if he shows up right what are you going to do you can't hide anything nothing is hidden from god but they thought well we'll just put him back here and hold him well the second day came and he didn't show up so satan's thinking well i am and now i'm stronger than him i was smarter than him but it didn't work but he still lost part of his brain because he really thought he was going to win and he was going to put on a show to torture the son of god in front of all of his hierarchy so he sent out a message for all the principalities and powers come in and sit on the front row and he moved it from the back of hell to the front where the gates are there's a courtyard the gates of hell the really gates there and they could see from abraham's muslims he couldn't put a show on the only ones who could see would be abraham's bosom right he's going to put a show on showing that he's more powerful than god i'm a torch of the son of god he wasn't the one that was going to torture so here comes the third day right he's got everything set up all the prince pallies and powers the big guys are all sitting right there in the front row i actually was i saw that i was there i saw all the little demons screaming and yelling all they do is scream and yell and complain complain and yell and blaspheme and complain and yell and blaspheme they they all the time because they're they're always everybody none of those demons like each other they want to out do outlie out cheat whatever they can that's what they do to each other and so they were like they were full of themselves because they were on the front row and all the other ones were behind them in a little while though they were going to be glad they weren't on the front row satan put all his uh cleanly attire on he had made and uh all of his faults gems well he had the gems god still put on him if you didn't know god put gemstones on him for a reason he had a reason he put he made mountings like in a ring and set these amazing beautiful gems there were like thousands of them on him and he was glorious he was glorious so he still had that glory he thought it was his he's going to lose it if you know what the word says it says christ what'd he do say it loud yeah that's what he stripped he took every single gemstone off of him that god put on him so here's the show's about to begin satan's going to put on a show he was talking all of his hierarchy right and here's jesus not saying a word just like his father he wasn't saying a word and then all of a sudden there was a role of thunder and all of hell's attention was gotten because they remembered what happens after that roll of thunder comes lightning is going to show up somewhere and then jesus christ stands up and there is a shout from heaven and jesus christ starts releasing the fire of god from himself and melted the faces of all the hierarchy of hell he began to they began to burn in the midst of hell fire with the fire of god literally like blue fire was shooting on his hands and i saw them melt like wax because as a little girl i would see them in different places i saw these demons and their faces were melted like that and like wax and i used to think what is that what did that what did that well i was about to find out and i mean literally saw them melted it says he ruined and spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of it openly and that's what he did he literally ruined them they can't go back they've never been able to fix their self okay satan can't fix you if you're in the army of darkness and you get wounded he can't heal you they got parts missing you can't you can't make them cease to exist but they get wounded they don't get healed okay i've seen them the holy spirit calls them shabby debris and if you knew holy spirit like that's exactly what he would say because i see the hosts going across the sky all the time i'm a seer i see them i see the demonic armies after they've been in a battle with the host of heaven they're hanging out for dear life because nobody wants to help each other like hanging on they have these horrific looks on their face because they have just been wiped out by the host of heaven and i said man they look really bad and the holy spirit said i call that shabby debris and they go i can't think of a better thing to call it because they look like debris you know something washes up on the shore where parts of it are missing that was them we better be glad they don't work together well right we're glad they don't even like each other right because the hosts look out for each other they protect each other look out for each other they're there for each other hell is just the opposite nobody cares about anybody so here comes shabby debris they look like shabby debris that day in hell and this is what jesus was saying you will never have the power to hold a righteous man in this place and anyone who received christ they will never be able to take you there or hold you there amen yeah and when he was done wasting the principalities and powers then he turns to their leader they ran they didn't wait around to see what was going to happen to him they abandoned him they left him they were running over top of the little demons trying to get out of the space they were happy they weren't on the front row that day it worked on their behalf and all of abraham's bosom were shouting and cheering and yelling and celebrating [Applause] because they'd already given themselves to him now there is their messiah wiping out the devil he he literally he literally ripped his clothes off threw him on the dirt and one by one took every single gemstone away from him and he was left with none it was ugly because all he had was these spiky little settings that god had put all over in his wings and his beings he was decorated by god and now he has put false ones in there he's made false ones they don't look anything like what he did but he was he was utterly totally completely defeated he is a doormat he is not over you he is under you he is under our feet so what is under your feet under your feet is a doormat isn't that what he says then don't be afraid of him we're not supposed to have any fear in us right and the fear of the lord is not that you will be afraid that he will hurt you it is you are afraid you will hurt him you're so in love with him you don't want to do anything that would hurt the lord that's what the fear of the lord is the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and with all your getting of wisdom get understanding which is knowledge of the holy one don't you don't you love the word i love it isn't that good so there you go that was a reality show from heaven and then he did the the most the greatest insult he did to satan was to take something that not just his he took you know he had no pride left really out utterly stripped him of all his glory and he fell because of that glory but he did something even worse than that he took away authority he took away authority that he had gained because adam gave it to him and he had been ruling with that authority until something changed that's one of the reasons why christ had to come he had to come he had to walk as a man like you and i choosing not to sin say not to sin he had to choose that with his own will not to sin because him being not just righteous but holy okay and then him being going into hell and they think that they could keep him it was devastating to the enemy when he realized we should have never taken him because it said if they had known they would have never done it right it was bushwhack time the enemy was bushwhacked by the son of god and so he stands there after he stripped all this all the gemstones off of him he reaches down and takes away the keys keys represent authority they have always represented authority and you know that if the wealthiest man in a city back in christ's time and even before that the wealthiest people were given the keys to the city did you know that that's not just something we do here on earth you know when you see someone comes to hollywood or they come to a state they've done something great like oral robots was actually given the key to oklahoma city by the mayor the mayor of the governor one of them and they actually redeemed their self because they were not on god's high list because of the way they had treated oral roberts they scorned him they made fun of him they judged him criticized him in the media and the newspapers but before he died somebody got smart and they apologized to him in public they gave him the key to the city not just the city actually they gave him to see the key to that city but also i think the governor and the mayor were both there apologized repented on behalf of all those who had mistreated him recognized him for the contribution that he had done for them and so they gave him the key to the city that's still significant today when you have a key but the wealthy people were always sat in the city gate back in jesus times and before that in abraham's day the wealthy people sat in the city gate with the elders and they were recognized because they they gave contributions to help the city and so they were given keys and they were given money backs and they had authority they had a say over what went on in that city they were recognized by their wisdom because of their wealth and so that's just something that's always been well he lost all of it in hell that day he lost all of his authority all of his glory all of his a lot of respect from the demonic because they realized then at that very moment our lives aren't going to be the same because now we can be wasted by anyone who is righteous can waste us everyone who receives him will now have power over us so their lives were changing even satan's life was changing he had to get a lot better deception because he no longer had those keys to hell death in the grave i'm i probably won't have time to go into tonight but christ uses those keys he uses them for us you should be really happy about that amen we have so many promises given to no no one else in the earth except those who've received jesus christ you have great power on the inside of you have great authority you have already been given dominion on the earth don't don't act like you're nothing don't say you're nothing you have great value everybody person everyone here is valued by god everyone here was given a gift to use in the natural realm in heaven you're going to use that gift whether it's baking cookies making a really amazing barbecue designing apparel designing interior design designing amusement parks making movies in heaven uh sports in heaven are played as worship yet are really quiet how many people have never heard me talk about this before i know somebody who has let me see your hands okay it makes sense because god gave you that gift they are irrevocable as a matter of fact even the wicked have their gifts and they won't be taken away from them you choose how to use that gift in the earth that's why there's people who belong to satan and they have gifts to act or sing or whatever it is and what they produce is dark because their heart is dark they're going to have the gifts no matter what amen but your gift is so important that that god calls it precious is something special he calls you you are a gift every good and perfect gift that's you comes down from the father of lights that was you you were light you were made out of light he knit you together in your mother's womb at the time of conception that spiritual body made out of light was knit together with that physical little dot of flesh and that's when life begins but when you came you had you were that gift already whether it was someone who was going to sing or be a musician dance create a clothing apparel food spices roads highways anything you see in this place was created by somebody it was designed and invented by somebody you wouldn't have anything to wear to walk on to sleep on to sit on to look at entertainment places to go and enjoy yourself you wouldn't have highways to drive on planes to go in those were gifts god sent people to be and all those gifts are used in heaven for everybody who lives there so it's not boring yes they have stylists there they have salons there they color your hair with light this is heaven culture everyone in heaven has color in their hair so wear it [Music] it's like art is considered a form of art okay they also have the culinary arts in heaven everybody eats food and they love it it tastes better than anything you've had on the earth and don't argue with me because the mirror's supper of the lamb is not grapes and crackers if the lord of glory was going to have a supper he made everything that ever existed he's not going to give you just grapes there'll be unending food everywhere everything you love to eat with no weight gain or food allergies and i i happen to know that that wedding supper is going to last a long long [Music] time he has a really big house [Laughter] this is just reality time i guess we're having a reality heaven show of things that happen throughout time okay even elijah loves to tell the story of the prophets of baal because he saw what happened in the spirit realm when all that went on so when you go to heaven now and he shares it it has a whole different meaning like when you get to heaven and you get to see how christ wasted hell you will shout and scream forever there was the day satan was kicked out there was a day he was crushed down he had authority stripped from him he was unseated from his authority that he operated in the earth for generations and ages because something new was happening the messiah was on the earth and then he went and died for us so that every every sin you ever commit when you repent and say when i repent it will be forgiven he will cleanse me from all unrighteousness like it never happened heaven absolutely celebrates every time somebody gives herself to christ especially all the family members who never get to never miss it every family member saw all of your family get born again they saw the babies being born they saw the weddings every birthday on your birthday they go in heaven get a gift and put it in your mansion that's being built so when you come there every year you were apart they have a gift for you you got a lot of family you'll have them up to the ceiling probably going out the doors your pets will be there taking over your mansion if you had a whole lot you probably have heaven's zoo because he has a sense of humor beyond not just his creativity is beyond what you imagine his humor is beyond anything you imagined and you will not stop laughing okay you will laugh till you fall on the streets of gold and people step over you everybody wants to know you the disciples will come to greet you the prophets we have prophets watching us right now from heaven they're watching this meeting right now while i talk about them okay we have the the ancient prophets we have the new ones who just passed home to heaven and are enjoying their reward and their celebration in the throne room i know i've already seen kim clement up there i've seen oral roberts billy joe daughtry i've seen many people great men and women of god i've seen them in heaven i've seen celebrities in heaven that made it up there like john wayne lives in cowboy heaven did you think they wouldn't have on what was his gift cowboy movies and they don't even have to have ratings on them aren't you glad all family friendly every single one of them when i used to speak in hollywood i would say if you don't want to use that gift you better you better go to heaven because you won't use it down there not only do not have breakfast in hell they don't have movies in hell either okay you don't get popcorn you get nothing in heaven you have this little menu that appears and you pick what you want and there's your food right there while you watch the movie the movie that is being captured probably not far from where you're at shown instantaneously in these cedars in heaven they're called reality theaters it was the very first place they took me they could have taken me anywhere in 1996 i was caught up to heaven for the first time jesus warned me walked through the wall of my home while i was doing dishes although i spent a lot of time in prayer it wasn't during that time he walked in while i was washing dishes not my favorite thing to do i tell people i'm not susie homemaker okay i am a business person but of course i raised three daughters i was a wife i had to take care of my home while i was doing everything else at the same time and so jesus walked through the wall of my home he said go sit down the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and i didn't say no and the first place it took me was to have a fun place because i knew there was a throne room i knew there were certain places already in heaven i knew they were there i knew about the river of life it talks about it in the word of god it says heaven is a country and it's a city so i knew they had both even if i hadn't seen them i knew they were both there go read hebrews 8. correct it's in hebrew right it says heaven is a city it's a country yeah so go read and hebrews actually talks a lot about heaven that's where the great cloud of witnesses is talked about the great people of faith have passed on to so go read hebrews it talks about heaven so i knew there were certain things there but and i was delighted i thought there was probably something fun to do i didn't realize that heaven is almost 50 50. half fun and half profound when his children came home he had to have something for them to enjoy and do and so yeah i was the first place i was taken uh jesus came in the person yes i knew it was him i'd actually seen him cut a few times on the earth before he walked through the wall of my home i've known him since i was four years old i got saved twice age four and age five and this was 1996 when this happened so i had had encounters with angels i could see i was always a seer i'd see the demonic operations i see heaven's operations all around me my grandmother had some of that in her my dad had encounters with angels it was a way of life it wasn't like strange something strange to me but it was absolutely delightful to see that there's so many fun things to do in heaven and what's in my books are encounters i had and how people got stunned when god would take me up let me stand by their family members who had just passed away i heard them talking about their life on earth i knew the family members names i knew what they looked like even though i had never met them on the earth then god would walk me through their mansions i would see how the mansion was built i knew what was on their property and then he would bring me back down and then he would give me their family members names and phone numbers on the earth if he can take you to heaven and show you stuff if he knows there'll be hair on your head he knows all your phone numbers right and i would write it down he'd have me call he'd have me type everything down i heard and saw and then it would call these people and say i didn't have pink hair back then when i used to do that okay he still shows me people but but when i started this whole thing i didn't have pain care and i say uh i believe god has shown me something about your family member in heaven would you like to know what it is and i didn't know these people i i didn't know they didn't even know how i got their number i didn't want to tell my got their number i just said god has shown me something and they will go who are you talking about and i say their family member's name they would get they would i couldn't see but i knew they were shaking on the other end of the line and they go uh yes i want to know will you meet me at the mall will you meet me at the park because they sure weren't going to invite me to their home they never wanted to take me to their home they never ever ever took me to their home and i would show up and i would have everything typed down on a piece of paper god even gave it a title did you know god loves to name things he gave it a title like it was a script and i wrote it like it was a script i put everything in quotes that jesus said that i heard them say you know i described the aromas the emotions the colors everything the frequencies that were there how they traveled what was in their mansion what it looked like what their favorite colors were what their gift was because they were using their gift and i didn't know anything about them and i tell them to sit down and i would hold the paper up here so i didn't look at them and i just began to read and i would hear them laugh and cry and cry and laugh and laugh and cry and they would shake and when i was done i'd say do you believe god showed me this about your family member in heaven and it wasn't for me it was for them and they go i don't know you i never met you but you told me things only my family member would know so i have to believe you saw my family member they were so absolutely undone and then they began to tell me they confirmed what i saw because i knew what they were doing and i knew what their gift was because you used that gift in heaven whether they were a florist in heaven or they're designing apparel in heaven uh whether they were over the youth in heaven which the 13 year old girl was put over the youth of heaven and she was 13. and her whole life she planned to be a youth pastor and she met her kids in her elementary school in her middle school everybody loved her i heard from her mother after i shared all the stuff i saw her with her great grandfather that looked like he was in his 20s and he was taking her on rollercoaster rides in the amusement park and i mean huge roller coasters like the biggest one is called the rush it leaps off the track goes across the sky to another part of the track yeah i thought that was pretty cool and the wild thing was the angels were riding them too they were riding them too i could not see the end of this amusement park i've been there three times i could not see the end to it kids got in bubbles and rode over it in bubbles or you went by you went and learned how to fly like superman then you flew over it guess who teaches you how to fly christopher reeves i hear your thoughts he got born again he got born again what did he do on earth he was superman right he teaches you to fly in heaven so i'm telling you this is all this is in my first trip to heaven and i remember every aroma every emotion i remember i remember every word that people said i remember every creature that i saw what they look like their flowers saying they changed colors the host of heaven were there there was these beautiful angels that were green like dust like green emerald dust stepped out the waterfalls and they cared for the waterfalls and the streams in heaven and they were feminine looking they were so captivating their song was so captivating so i remember all that in my first trip and christ i remember christ took me aside before he brought me back and he goes i want you to tell them on the earth there'll be many people in heaven they never expected to see there but they prayed them in if they don't give up on them we will not give up on them if you belong to me i won't let your words drop to the ground and i got undone i think it was the most spectacular thing that happened when i was there was when he told me that because he said it will give hope to so many people because he's a good god isn't he and so i saw this young girl was talking to her great grandfather as they're walking down this path going through when you're going into a new part of heaven there's gates that are always open there's just like columns with gates there's not walls inside heaven and and that's they were going through these big purple and gold gates and they were going to the amusement park i didn't know that at the time and so the lord said get up there so you can hear what that young girl is saying and she was talking about her mom that they had a great relationship when i see my mom again i'm going to kiss her on both cheeks i'm going to share everything that's happened to me up here in heaven i wish she knew i was a youth leader in heaven and then and she just kept talking then i saw them go on a roller coaster ride and then christ brought me back and i got her mom's number and called her and the funeral had just happened and she was her at that time her only daughter and uh although i was told later that she was profited over by a prophetess that she would have a very short life but she wouldn't pack the whole world for christ which she was because of the testimony and so when i was sharing this with her mom outside jc penney's at a table at the mall she got undone and she began to tell me after i told her all the stuff i saw i saw on the roller coasters i heard the words that she said and she she was crying and weeping and she said that what i told you i've never known you've never met you i've never don't know you but you said things only my daughter knew she goes the day before she died the day before they buried her i was in her room and i saw a journal under her bed that was written she was like seven her daughter was 13 when she passed away she said i start to go through it and look at the pages and i found written on the pages these words last night i dreamed i died early and went to heaven early i saw my great grandfather and i went on roller coaster rides i didn't know that journal was there it was wonderful but he only gave me a peak so as fast as the roller coaster i fell back to earth and her mother was the only one who knew about that journal and i didn't know her mother you know what god was doing he was giving me evidence that heaven was not only real but it was fun she said her daughter every day would kiss her on both cheeks before she went to school when she came on she shared everything that had happened to her life in her life during that day and she had planned her whole life to be a leader a youth pastor and a leader that was her goal and she was doing that in heaven at age 13. i heard her say you know that um i'm cheering my mom on you know she didn't know she couldn't see me okay people never saw me in heaven but i heard all these words and she said that she was a cheerleader and her favorite colors were blue and white she was wearing a blue white tunic top and pant when i saw her it was her favorite color even on earth so you still have your favorite colors in heaven and so all these things everything i said that i wrote down that i remembered was significant to her she's never been the same since then she said she was my only daughter they tell me i can't have children god said tell her that she will have children i'll give her children and she has two twins right now ten-year-old twins with strawberry blonde hair like marissa had blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair twins and they have encounters in heaven so we have a good god that cares about you that cares about me you won't miss your destiny when you go to heaven none of your children will miss their destiny whatever he chose them to be here and that gift he gave them if it was a dancer there'll be a dancer in heaven if it was a cookie baker there'd be a cookie baker in heaven if it was a fisherman there'll be a fisherman in heaven if it was to create and invent all kinds of neat a high-tech gadgets they actually have a place called techno city in heaven where all the geeks live and they can create all kinds of just the wildest craziest things you even beyond what we have here on the earth although i saw some of those being brought to the earth because they have an idea zone in heaven and you see all these little sparkles in it like a million little pieces of glitter and every one of them is an idea an invention and god sends he takes a wave of that and sends it over the earth and it drops all these ideas and inventions in our minds and whoever grabs that idea and creates that idea that's why i see things on the earth already that i've seen in heaven they come from him does it say that they come from him yeah that's how he sends them isn't that amazing so god has a lot of plans for us right here on this earth right now everybody in here is special because you're alive right now everyone in heaven is cheering you on to run your to run your race right now in this kingdom age to live heaven culture to demonstrate and manifest for god it's not about how much education you've had it's not about what race you're born in it has nothing to do with any of that it has to do that you belong to jesus christ that you have given your life to him you've received him he put you here for a purpose he gave you authority power weapons he's now going to add to that creativity and invention say i receive it and he's also right now in this time and people are always asking me you know when are you going to start creating things and put it in the marketplace because i will create heaven on earth not just reveal heaven on earth my first assignment was to reveal it my second one is to create it we're going to create many products and things they have in heaven apparel games things for children we're going to produce movies in the earth places to go for entertainment for everybody to enjoy architecture interior design we're going to create walls that will talk to you and they will have movement in them you won't just paint your walls anymore you won't paint them you want wallpaper you're going to get parts of heaven and put them on there new technology is coming where you'll learn how to paint masterpieces with a light wand i saw people with drive-through tattoo powers and they put it on with light like what marking belongs to god it was stolen by the enemy and he put his marks on people for generations there's a scripture in psalms that says some people worship me in in song some and dance and some will put my marks on them joyce meyers read that now she's getting a tattoo if joyce myers can do i don't know who can say i'm not going to do it i don't know anybody who is as conservative and real as joyce i love joyce everybody say thank god for joyce she keeps us real doesn't she i can't wait to see what she's going to pick we're living in a new time like i was explaining john the baptist brought a new time with him there were new ways to do things okay that had nothing to do with the past and a lot of people rejected it because they knew god had said to do it this way well in that time he did things a certain way he himself does never change but he is a great creator and he does bring new things to the earth all the time and people go well if i can't see it line by line written well it doesn't say he's going to have microwaves do you have one it doesn't say he'll have cell phones but do you own one okay it doesn't even talk about cars but do you have one yes because as time goes by new things are brought to the earth and invented that we use to to improve our life is that correct that so that doesn't mean there's going to be that you won't see new things you've never seen before and these are things i'm talking about that will help all of humanity to either in to either make your life easier or to make you have a happier life a healthier life a more informed life there are new things coming to this earth i saw roads that we traveled on that were made out of light and the fuel was the light i'm glad someone's excited [Laughter] i i was shown these new things we will have hologram computers we can reach in and take the things out of the light and look at them and put them back in there i saw several major diseases including cancer that did not even exist on the earth it'll be abolished just think how much that'll change your life new fuels one is coming from outer space are you all excited saying man because you're staring at me do you know how much that will change our life we won't need the fuel from the desert or the sheiks we won't even need the coal from underground okay we won't even need solar energy i'm not talking about solar energy a whole fuel that god already put up there and all they need is the night the right receiver to bring it down in the transmitters in everybody's home to fuel your entire home and i saw what they look like they're about this big and you can move it wherever you want to you go in the middle of desert and camp and have have energy your bug zappers won't be fly swatters anymore because i take one when i go and i want one that big because i don't like bugs when i was 16 at a youth camp and i was finally invited to a banquet by someone who was brave my mama bought me this pretty dress had white lace sleeves to here and my neck was up to here and i went and took that thing that was hanging in the cabin i put on a walk-out to go meet my date for the banquet and something was moving up my sleeve i already told you i don't like it want no little bug it was this big and it was crawling up my arm this way and i was really shy so i wasn't going to tell anybody it was one of those grasshoppers black and red ones you know those things look like they came either from hell or from some other planet they look like they could take over the world and wanted to they had an attitude if you ever looked him in the eye i wouldn't i wouldn't suggest you do that when i'm i'm here like this right trying to calmly talk first time in my life i went anywhere with the opposite sex at all i got this pretty dress on and and the sleeves you know i was i was i was real skinny i mean real skinny and so that's the only reason why that thing was able to get up there and i've got lace you know lace does not move okay you can't open it up and shake something out so this thing is crawling further and further and i'm like i'm trying to hang on to it right and i'm like i thought it was gonna faint in front of them that's not gonna be a good first impression excuse me and i i was a really fast runner i chased my brothers all the time from my mama i ran so fast back to that cab and locked the door and i threw everything off i was going to take everything and there was that big oaky thing this big i didn't kill it i didn't want to go anywhere near i'm like what i'm gonna do i had to wait for it to walk away from my clothes so i could put him back on and go back out there you know about 15 minutes later and he goes are you okay i am i'm really good i'm all good right now and i sent my friends in the cabin to for the demise of the grasshopper so when i go camping i take big things to deal with the bugs but when you get this energy from space okay you can get the biggest bug zapper and probably put it around your entire tent so anything that comes out there is going to get zapped before it ever gets inside it was the most amazing thing it was just like a they had this thing that you pulled it down from space and everybody had them they just had them in their homes i saw them line highways and a hologram light they didn't have lamp posts like solid like this they had little things like this and all they did was have to place them where they went and attached them to the ground they had one little station a little kind of a thing like that and when they hit it the lights shot up from the ground and let the entire highway all the way down you didn't have to dig in the ground plant wiring run all the way down somewhere and hook it up to something this was a new form of energy that will change our world the missionaries wherever they are they can have power all the time no matter where you are out in the ocean on a boat it doesn't matter where you are because it's going to draw it down from space and he took me quite a while showing me this took me into the future and showed me someone this is going to be a great day for everybody and he said in your life in your lifetime which is probably forever it is going to happen i'm not planning to die i don't know about you i'm staying till he's done with me i'll let him choose that amen [Music] i'm not planning to escape by my rapture rug because even we can't decide that right so i'm just trying i'm just trying to share a little bit about what is coming into your lives it will affect you your kids your grandchildren great grandchildren great great great great great great grandchildren [Music] there have been quite a few people that have been caught up and taken over 100 years into the future i've been taking almost 150 years into the future and the perils times had not happened but it got better and greater and more powerful because the body of christ was standing up and being who god called them to be they no longer tolerated darkness or evil they weren't participating with it by by complaining and saying what they didn't have and who they weren't they stopped saying words of negativity you can't live a positive prosperous life if your soul is continually being fed negative words you just can't do it and actually if all you do is take in the doom and gloom you're not even going to be happy do you know god told me in order to create an event you had to be happy you had to be happy you know actually isn't happy better than sad do you know there's more things released in your body that are good when you are happy when you're sad and oppression comes things start changing even inside the way that your body is forming i don't know all those details about that okay i don't know those details don't care about them i just know that your inward workings of your body begin to not be good and if you live around negativity all the time then that's not good for you but you can change the atmosphere even where you live go in your room and say i'm not participating with all these words i'm evicting all these words out of the atmosphere of where i live i don't have to tolerate them i'm releasing the life of god the power of god the presence of god right here this is the atmosphere i'm gonna breathe it doesn't matter who owns that place if you were there you have the right to change the atmosphere you live in you can imagine if the body of christ ever gets this about the new time and starts operating like that how much change are we going to bring we were sent here to help change things is that right christ came and changed many things just a few short years he was here he rocked this world it's our time to put on a show this is all about the show begins you saw you heard about the show in heaven and let me tell you when all that was going on of the deception of the angels it wasn't just like calmly quietly done that's not the way it was done it was great deception and lucifer never told them i'm going to take over and be evil and kill steal and destroy he didn't say that to any of those angels he said i'm going to be greater than god i care more i'm wiser he doesn't know what i'm doing he doesn't know what i'm saying so i'm going to make sure everybody has wealth everybody has power we can all celebrate together while i rule and then he would have his own concerts and said he trafficked his wares he showed off that he could create because he was highly anointed for that and he would do that and he'd draw angels to himself let me tell you a third of them followed him but two-thirds didn't follow him and angels are real beings like you and i they're not married okay god had some mercy on them i'll be married 40 years to the same human being this november and i'm not picking anyone else okay been through it once didn't just survive but i'm victorious i actually is still very much in love with my husband and everybody knows it's a journey isn't it you learn to love and die and love and die and love and die and love and die to someone dies more than the other there's a lot more love and then you keep loving having grace so they can finish dying to their self and then it's wonderful [Laughter] but you won't be married in heaven you'll be best friends you'll remember you were married you'll do things all over heaven together and you will show off who is your husband who is your wife on the earth you celebrate all over heaven you go look at isn't she gorgeous it's the most beautiful thing you've seen this is who i was married to on earth yeah and they won't talk about any of the hard times they won't talk about any of the crazy times okay oh you share them if you had pets you share them because you live right next door and you're i was a you're parent are you a better parent they'll probably visit you more often you share them it's like children like when when um when parents come home to heaven if you if you had a miscarried little baby and you get that little baby you share them they stay with the mother stay with the father but this is it most of those people go everywhere together in heaven and and there's no like there's not like sleepovers okay although people move in and stay with you for a while i'm just preparing you i'm giving you a heads up warning right now when you come home to heaven all of your family will move into your mansion they probably already got their space picked out because they have missed you and they want to be with you okay this is a good news if you're going on a tour tell them to enjoy their self till you get back only they're probably going to follow you on the tour everybody goes on tours of heaven it doesn't matter if you stay with each other it doesn't matter okay i saw a whole i call them community mansions it was like a big hub like a big huge massive common area like probably like half of denver and off of this this com common area which was so supernatural was things you all enjoyed doing together on the earth it was uh even if it could include outdoor stuff by the way you can't say it was all like under a building no i'm talking about it was everything you enjoyed doing on the earth together as a family and then off of this are all these massive mansions coming off almost like a wheel with spokes and every spoke would be like i don't know i saw mansions the size of a city so i can't ever even say how big these mansions were and so everybody had their own space because you come home as his son and his daughter okay that's how you come home because he is your father when you come home he recognizes your son and your daughter and he gives everybody their own space and you will be very glad you have it you will love whatever it gives you to be so supernatural you could never afford to pay for it buy it or even build it here and it's going to be built around your gift the thing that is your passion that you love the most and then you go on tours all over heaven and christ invites you to his own private mansion where he throws a big party for you and invites all the disciples the apostles the prophets to come and see you and they're coming there to meet you he sends a special chariot or carriage to come and pick you up and then he has you decked out like a king or a queen and then you come and he escorts you into his place and introduces you and everybody celebrates that you're there and then you eat like forever [Music] he has a massive ballroom is the biggest part of his mansion because he loves to dance and on all the all down the walls are like king's tables laden with every kind of dessert you can imagine and his mansion sits in this field of flowers that are like six foot tall all of them sing the most glorious songs they are worshiping the lord of glory they will all know your name they will all welcome you as you come down this magnificent drive to say everybody say jesus deserves his own place just like us and he has one but he made a way so that you will never be away from him do y'all like this reality show tonight [Laughter] some people are hearing it for the first time if we're live streaming are we live streaming some some of these people for the first time in their life are probably getting rocked you know their mind is probably still going bonk after the first time i talk to them about something because that's what heaven does to you when you get there you walk around like you don't even know what to say you're looking at everything you're undone by the ground by the grass by the sky by the beings by the sounds the images of frequencies people riding on their worship you know i mean beams of light shooting by and it's a person coming from somewhere in heaven you step into these transport kiosks that are light beams shooting out and you ride on the light to places around here and you're walking down these streets of gold if you can you can look in them you can it can actually see your image in the streets of gold it looks like uh i don't know it's transparent gold but it's beautiful you can't even tell the depth of it you can't there's gems everywhere massive gems everywhere the mulch and the flower beds are gems like real gems and the angels will come sometimes and grab them up and throw them down to the earth and that's how they get in the meetings so you're you're being undone by everything that you're walking by everything that you're seeing in heaven and you'll never stop feeling that way you will never stop being undone it doesn't matter if people have been there 500 years a thousand years 2000 years they're still surprised by god he's he's always creating new things putting new things through there discovering new things it's so huge and massive you know i mean one day i don't even know if we'll get to seattle before he makes the new earth isn't that amazing i i love him i love him more every day and people go how can you carry that because he lets me he lets me carry it i have a i have a i can't even remember in the natural words anymore i have a photographic memory he gave me that from the time i was a little kid it helped a lot in school i look at a list one time you never have to look it again i remembered everything it said i'd read one thing like you know two weeks later we had a test and i would pass every test because i remember but he wanted somebody with a with a photographic memory to do this so they could remember everything i remember the thousands of times i've been there i remember everything i remember every detail i remember the aromas will get you undone the christ himself carries an aroma and i can go places and i know he was there it's beautiful it's a beautiful smell but i also smell the other side i know when they've been in places and it's putrid it smells like death so yes they both exist heaven exists hell exists just like the bible says okay you have to read the word to know it if you don't know the word then he can't bring it alive to you if you don't read the word he can't bring he can't highlight stuff i know how many people have ever happened you've read a scripture so many times in one day you read it and it comes alive to you [Applause] if you read the word you are storing it in your soul and in a moment when you need it that's how come it comes up in you because you put it there yourself when you read it i play the bible somewhere in my house and it's always feeding my soul you can feed your soul at night while you're sleeping and i don't know why more believers don't but i play powerful anointed worship 24 hours a day in my home because he inhabits the praises of his people whether it's in person or whether it's on a cd okay there's anointed sounds songs frequencies if you play and put them in your home it will draw heaven to your home you know that's what we should all put there right so y'all stand up for a minute i want to thank you for letting me share i don't want to keep it really long because i know i have to be back in the morning i was supposed to share about some of my products i there's one called revealing of the kings it's the spiritual kings in case you didn't know this revelation this is the day he's revealing these spiritual kings who will walk in the earth that's whoever runs after that those are eternal levels of authority christ said you will rule and reign with me now right and the agents to come he will rule with him throughout eternity that's not a temporary position there's lords priests and kings and he told me face to face what i have written on my thigh is not natural kings i am the king of spiritual kings who will walk in high levels of authority in the earth no man can give them that title they will demonstrate they operate in that authority and dominion in the earth and that's how people will know who they are so there are priests it says in the word we are priests and kings to our god and he's the king of king and lord of lords that's what this thing tells you about now scrolls of time to have opened the culture of honor how they live in heaven the kingdom age born again that i already told you about powerful and this one which is hilarious not theirs it's called superheroes and there i am with the superhero costume on that was not my plan kids love it so there i am a superhero you all know that if you pray for others if you stand in the gap for others then you are superheroes for heaven i went to morningstar to speak for the women and they invited me to speak to the five-year-olds i did not know now i wore i have a superhero costume it's not spandex tights okay but it's but a superhero blue pants i mean stretch is superhero blue so i would get it right and and i had my superhero shirt on and all my little things that i wear and i did not know that the bible teacher had just taught them for six weeks that they were superheroes for heaven and i didn't know that had all drawn pictures of me wearing a superhero costume because that wasn't even on the agenda that wasn't on the program for me to even speak to them but when i went to go speak to them god said you're taking that with you when i i am like like am i wearing that on the platform for like all the adults and he said no but take it and then when they said you want to speak to five-year-olds yes i will speak to them because i knew what i was going to wear and so here i come in the back of the room and all the little kids are up there giving testimonies and the bible teachers stand and he starts laughing out loud here i am in my superhero costume and all the kids start screaming and yelling so i kind of ran and i jumped into the scene it was a very memorable meeting and then they called me up front they each gave me their little picture of they drew of me isn't holy spirit awesome he set that whole thing up because i had no idea i just said yes when he said take it and i'm like okay all day good and all the little kids uh we took pictures together and i hugged them i encouraged them i told them how how pleased the father was with a great future they had on this earth and so it was something i won't forget it was also amazing so everybody hold up their hands i'm gonna i'm gonna just speak something into your life i'm a prophesy corporately he won't let me do it individually but you know what this is the time for the corporate body of christ and when i say this this is for everybody watching also hold up your hands okay i speak for the most high god and i say you will be great in the earth i say you will do greater works even than christ did i say you live in a supernatural time where you yourself will create witty ideas and inventions and bring them to mankind to change them forever i say you will walk in truth you will walk in the spirit you will move in the spirit you will travel in the spirit you will shake things you will stun hell you will carry the light of god until you shine like the stars in the heavens you will handle the wealth of the wicked you will push back darkness you will run your race with the host of heaven i declare a decree that you are priests that you are lords that you are kings unto your god receive it says your god amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] and you will live long enjoy happiness and have the most fun you've ever had in your life may you prosper be in health and may the host go with you amen

while they're doing that jesus is right behind me on the platform [Applause] [Music] he's right there [Music] [Applause] wow he has an agenda it's called america all right when she started flagging that sound you heard was his train filling the temple and there was an angel bigger than this building outside he was flapping his wings he was moving his wings and then all the others stepped through him and filled here and then jesus stepped right through that wall that's what you were feeling his presence he was overwhelmed and undone by the worship he loves the hearts of those who worship in spirit and in truth and he walked up to me and said i'm going to speak today and tell this world what i think about [Applause] america who am i i am that i am i am from the beginning and the end there is no man who has lived on this earth that i did not make that my father did not carry until they were sent here we did not create evil that was birthed in a created being because he chose it do not choose darkness it will overtake you and consume you it will blind the light we put inside of you no one will take my country no one will remove my name off of your documents or your buildings no one will remove the blood strikes on your flag [Music] no one can stand before me and say they are greater than i am for i am going to rebirth america it will be greater than it ever was before it has not even seen the peak of its greatness america is great because i created it to be great it is my gift to the nations i created it to stand with my people in israel for america is a friend of israel i hid america in their name j e r u s a l e m if you want to know where america is in the bible it's in the name of jerusalem [Applause] for i have hidden it i hid it before i birthed it the enemy wants it if he thinks he can make decrees over my country i will wipe them out [Applause] i will overturn every wicked law every evil decree i will remove every wicked person for i have chosen someone to sit in the white house and he will sit in the white house as president if you do not like him then you say nothing because you're speaking against my plan you don't know my ways and my thoughts for the generations before him in his line paid a price with their life for the kingdom he could not escape being great he's been thrown into this because i called him into this pray for him pray for everyone who he chooses that he chooses by my will but i will no longer tolerate the evil the decay in this land i will no longer that will not will not tolerate the enemy trying to overtake my country for my name is written in its documents for i was with those who wrote those documents even their names have been slandered and lies told about them i will not tolerate it this is a new age i call it the kingdom age it is time for my people to lay down their differences stop your footing you are helping the enemy i say in this day and age you come together for the world must see you loving each other you have to love each other first before you can love others my blessing falls on agreement for those leaders in my house my house not your house my house it is mine and i am taking it [Music] back those leaders in my house who are not yielding my spirit i will remove you [Applause] in this day it is critical that you work together that you love one another this is not about you being important this is not about you becoming somebody it's about you showing me my love my truth my purposes my plans lay down your plans and find out my plans because i choose to make america greater than ever was before i say the world will race after the pattern i'm going to put in america i see the world run after the products made in america for i have made america it is mine many have paid a price for this land i will not overlook their blood crying out where is justice and liberty and freedom i will not tolerate freedom being taken from this land that even the children cannot be saved in their own schools i will not tolerate it you will see the hand of your god move mightily in this land i know i made this world i do not hate the earth i made it with my own hands from my father spoke and anything you spoke i created it i even changed my very image to come here and walk amongst you i know your weaknesses i know your hurts and your pains i would no longer tolerate it in this country for light shall abound and the darkness for generations shall be pushed back regions of light and glory will be created in this country that sin and crime will not be able to abide in because i will erase even the very first steps to the demonic who have threat there [Applause] but you must stand up and decree and declare and make rulings for in this time my kings my spiritual kings will lay out decrees and rulings and i will do them because they will live holy and they will obey they will let me have my way if you want to know me you must pursue me i do not control i lead and i love but you cannot keep insisting in heaven your own way you can't have my will in your way it does not work because my father's kingdom my father's kingdom the kingdom of heaven is coming to this earth even now the hosts millions and millions of them have been sent from heaven to work with the believers to help defend them and pull down the strongholds they are your weapon in this day and age for i have chosen this time on the earth my father has chosen this time on the earth you can either participate or you can stand and watch it happen but in eternity you will be so thankful that you participated i do not want to hear any more trashing and bashing i don't want to hear evil and wickedness and darkness coming out of your mouth if you say you are mine then stop it for i have said this day i offer you life and death i said choose life because every time you speak death you will perish your soul will perish you must love but you must share the truth you cannot embrace the other false religions you are not helping them do not read their articles or their doctrines because they will clutter your soul you read my word you live by every word that is spoken every spoken word you live by it the written word is a guideline but the spoken word never stops revelation is being released from heaven like never before in this day but the enemy also is releasing deception you do not want to be caught in deception you need to be free and full of me you need to be dangerous against the plans of darkness for i created you perfectly and amazingly and then i gave you the power that i carry operate in it every day of your life it's not something you use in just a time of crisis you live in it it's a lifestyle you rule it's a lifestyle when you rule the enemy will run but i will not tolerate the words that are being spoken against this nation stop cursing it and stop asking us to curse it it says in your own papers and in your songs god bless america i cannot curse it if you have stated that you must bless america bless it in every way bless your families bless your friends even bless your enemies for when you do that it gives us the power to run after them liberty and justice we're birthed in this land the freedom to know me to worship me this land has provided for over two-thirds of the gospel to be preached to these nations of the world why would i curse it you yourselves live here are people they live here why would we curse them great change massive change forced change is now in america i will put a trumpet in the white house [Applause] and he will know me and he will hear me you don't need a preacher in the white house you need a businessman in the white house my father is in business that's why i had to be about his business i am his ceo in heaven i know how important it is business will take the gospel further than the church ever could the marketplace will touch this world with things from heaven anointings from heaven stop running around looking for a plan we have a plan is to make america greater than it ever was before i speak to my leaders if you call yourself a leader of jesus christ and start acting like me my agenda freedom and liberty for all justice for those who cry out for justice to love to share the truth i died to set men free not put them in captivity you must trust me but i am hand picking the people who will be in the white house not for one term but if we ask down for term after term after term i will have the people i want because this is the kingdom age and america will flourish and prosper and the light will grow and grow and go to the world it'll be a pattern of what i'm going to do to all those other countries so you my people and the other countries bless america pray for america you will be seating for the change in your own country i know that i have revivals in many other countries great revivals they were powerful i will not bring up no revival i am coming for a habitation not a visitation this day i vote i vote i vote and i am voting for donald trump he will hear my voice i will put those around him that hear my voice he's already selected some that hear my voice because no matter what you think about him he at least loves this country [Applause] he was born here he grew here he worked here he helped here i've always chosen many and leaders that people would not choose that's because you're not me i see the future i've been to the future you have not been there if you have a better plan present it to my father we've had many discussions and many meetings in heaven we've made great plans to release things down to the earth ideas and inventions and wealth and wealth and wealth and wealth and wealth it took money to build america it will take money to rebuild it and make it greater do not say i want you poor because i desire above all things as your soul prospers and you guard it and you feed it life and you speak life it will prosper and then you will prosper and you will be in health this is a day when you will taste of the powers of the age to come that will be my age that will be my time to sit on the throne in jerusalem but this is this day this is the time when you will rule and reign with me i've written your name on my thigh and now my garments because i am the king of the spiritual kings of this earth and i am the lord of the spiritual lords of this earth eternal positions that you will never attain to unless you are first my priest in love with me consumed by me that know me or that are pursuing me seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness sake don't leave out the righteousness his kingdom come his will be done on earth just like it is in heaven that's why you need revelation of heaven pursue it seek it for yourself but not just listen to it apply it because you will live and not die if you apply it i have given you my word this day to go around this world this is my earth and the fullness thereof and i am changing things because my people have prayed and they have repented and i will come and heal their land and heal any land where my people have prayed and asked me to come to begin to celebrate live a celebrated life [Applause] don't forget to have fun because fun is a weapon too says you're good [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] everyone stand up please going to make a declaration to the lord before he goes he just yelled you rule because i rule and the way they salute in heaven is like this i want everyone to do that and say we rule because he rules you ready we rule because he rules [Applause] wow wow i think he voted whoa can you bring my phone margaret i love it when god confirms things and he made a great distinction between himself and the father didn't he he wanted to know who he was i made a little list of things i knew he wanted me to talk about and then most of this was already in the songs of the decorations and besides i didn't know he was going to speak today i knew i would speak for him he came as the lord of glory and by the way that crown he wears his father took it off his own head and put on his sunset [Applause] he was wearing that crown i'll see if i can share a few of these things if i can remember how to operate this right now in heaven you wouldn't need this that awesome wow i knew he was coming when i saw that angel he's the head of his train when his train his train are the are the angels or the host that's what makes up his garment [Laughter] i was really figured he was coming because of the level of praise but when i saw the angel standing outside i knew he was coming i've been sitting i sat in my sanctuary one time and my pastor would always have me sit on the front row so i could sketch because i've always seen in the spirit realm he had me sit there and draw everything i saw in the spirit realm during the service and until one day when i was on the floor on the front row because jesus came in his train filled our sanctuary and then he came in in his own flaming chariot and i was sitting on that front row thinking he's gonna say something and i mean his eyes were that flames of fire his hair was white as wool his garments were so brilliant i almost couldn't look at them and his chariot stopped and he got off and came up to me i was on the floor and he said you tell my people i only came once a savior when i come back i'm coming as king [Applause] and when he just spoke he was wearing his crown [Laughter] he came as king today [Music] he wants our children to have a future [Applause] he wants our children to know how to rule kick the enemy out of their school train the kids they won't ever forget it he's serious i lost my notes shaking i'm shaking wow i've seen the father come when he comes his rainbow penetrates the building before he ever gets there i've seen him i've seen him come with the living creatures the two that carry his throne there's four around his throne but there's two that hold up the arms of his throne they have four heads you know it talks about the ones with the four hats kneeling they're about 80 foot high and their backs hold the armrest of the father's throne when it talks about the wheels the wheels come out of them and they begin to move and that throne moves like this yeah yeah he was talking about him not humans talking but they were talking to super natural humans here today and around the world if you belong to him you're a supernatural human not of this world he reminded me last night you are the aliens he has repeatedly told me there are no aliens there's no other race out there that you might happen chance find in case you don't like heaven there's heaven and there's the other place and after that if you choose that it's a lake of fire there's no other places to abide that's right i'm choosing into that i've seen the other place you don't want to go there i'm just going to keep sharing this message is called made in america so i am wearing america i've always been very patriotic i have voted in every election from the time i was 18 i voted your votes count you need to vote [Music] in this election you're going to vote for light or darkness there's no other platform that's your choices you choose light or darkness i would say choose light that same god that just spoke is about to display himself in signs and wonders around this world that he will do himself but there'll be ones that we do for him this world has to see us doing those supernatural things because we belong to a supernatural god [Applause] you need to see it the true image of the living god one who loves the one who lives holy and yet they have more fun in heaven than they do on this earth if you're going to live heaven culture you have to have fun he wants every intercessor to come out of the closet and you have fun before you go back in because fun will be your greatest weapon in this season he said you need to have all night fun parties instead of all night prayer meetings because when you come back for the prayer meetings there'll be a whole lot more powerful than when you did it before the fun this is a strange thing to the body of christ we thought they had to be serious and profound well sirius and went to sour somewhere it all went south somewhere [Applause] because when the world hears a believer they don't think wow fun they don't think wow they love us wow have you ever seen a group of people that really cared about each other that is not what they talk about then i go man i want to be like them but they will [Music] they will i saw a time in the earth when people wanted friends to be believers they wanted believers for their friends he said it sounds well but it will be popular to be the friend of a believer because jesus did that in his day i like heavens playing better than ours you can't leave the holy spirit out of anything amen i don't know if you know this but in the baptist convention i may be mistaken about the location but i'm not mistaken about the declaration that they've had a meeting and someone high up said we can no longer resist ignore or shut out the activities and the receiving of the holy spirit it literally was spoken it was either at the beginning of this year or the last part of last year spoken to the highest hierarchy in the baptist convention i i believe i'm trying to remember this correct i like to be correct but somebody was sent out to do a survey i don't know if it was to all the missionaries it was somewhere specific to look at groups of what their people were doing and they came back with a shocking report they had all fallen way behind because they visited many missionary places and the ones that were flourishing and prospering were friends with the holy spirit and then they just looked in general when they saw they began to look in general just everywhere and they were seriously shocked and very concerned for their denomination so they really went to the whoever this person was had the right and the permission to speak to them and they said we can no longer ignore this we're going to fall behind everyone else and there's no life there's life where the spirit is they're being set up for the kingdom age [Applause] because you do know the holy spirit moved his operations to planet earth now he's still in heaven because he's everywhere but he moved his operations from heaven to earth because jesus sent him here all three of them in the course of time are required because of what they did for us to move from heaven people go where's that in the bible i will tell you where it is in the bible jesus was sent first the word he was the word the host still call him the word they have worked closer with him than almost any of the other angelic beings because he is the lord of hosts he's the lord of the host he was involved in all the army activities in heaven when he used to fight for israel they fought the human beings watch out they did they did at that time they fought the human beings and and destroyed them angel wiped out i forgot 185 000 something like that it was crazy they were god's chosen people they represented him in this earth they were in trouble of course evil and wickedness which is always controlled parts of this earth and people on this earth you know the devil can't do something himself he has to have a living soul to control we've always said he needs the spirit well he does he possesses the spirit but he still has to have control of the soul because the soul is what you act with it's what you think you choose and display that would be you that's why he wants to destroy your soul that's why god has given revelation on the soul you are a living soul that is a powerful declaration that's one of the things about being a little mini god you know you're not that ye are gods it's not some wild weird thing we're not taking over heaven we're not going to become god but we're supposed to operate in the way they operate when they speak things happen when you speak down here things are supposed to happen they have creative power why do you think we create an event down here we do it because that's their likeness it's what they do really it's not hard when you get revelation of understanding of the scriptures that we were made in his image that means he has a body god hazard body the father has a body a powerful body he's magnificent his hair is white as wool i i touch it sometimes when he takes me up to the stone it's alive it's living it's moving everything in heaven has life in it it's alive he wants our earth to be alive he wants you to be alive we're supposed to be carriers of life because he carried life and centered this earth you're supposed to carry life that's his image the word was magnificent he was fully spiritual he did not look like jesus christ he changed his very appearance he didn't have flesh the father put flesh on him like melchizedek had melchizedek has flesh he's always had flesh he's ahead of a whole tribe of angels that have flesh before we were sent here angels are made in tribes that's why there's tribes on the earth that's why there's tribes in israel that wasn't a new thing god did the angels are created in tribes we had a whole tribe here today you know tribe of the host here god is very detailed and specific when he makes anything we need to be the same way he likes to use the word strategic he's very strategic in his plans right now he's got strategy laid out and designed i've been shown the next couple hundred years for america it's gonna get a whole lot better because when god steps in life comes with him truth comes with him creativity and blessings come with him this habitation you have no way can you even imagine in your mind or even myself and all that i have seen and been shown and i've seen supernatural shocking amazing things but even i cannot contain the scope of what is going to happen through this habitation and it's starting in this generation of people it's a typing group of people we're that type and group of people right now because you know why you're alive right now that's why you're included he timed your birth on the earth to be a part of this some of you may not have any idea what i'm talking about i'm talking for god this is how he talks he has a plan follow his plan you have to know him to do this okay you can't go out there and rule and reign over the darkness if you don't know jesus christ remember the seven sons of skeva that was a bad day that was a bad choice and there were seven of them not one they thought they could use his name and take over demons they got overtaken they probably never tried that again you're not going to get away with saying you're using the power of god on this day his name is holy but this is also a day of greatness and excitement and celebration and i've learned something from the father if i do not celebrate every day of my life what i do i might become weary sometimes it's hard work it's wonderful work it's amazing work i don't have a life because i gave it to him you know it's easy to celebrate god and the vision when i'm alone with him but i have to live with people who are not on the level i'm on and i want them to be there don't drag them there it does not work i'm learning to love my family until god can change them and deal with them it's not my job to deal with them i cannot stop and fix everything for everybody out there that i hear from and it pulls on my heart because i love people but i cannot fix you i give you revelation if you apply it then god's power will fix you god will not let me do personal ministry don't call my office and ask for it and then say i'm mean and ugly because i won't do it this is what god said if you obey it will all be okay i am not going to disobey him i wasn't called to be in the five-fold ministry i'm not a pastor hallelujah bless every pastor on the earth god i want supernatural blessings this day to begin to fall on their sacrifice they've given their life for they've been bitten by sheep spitting by sheep talk bad about sheep keep going yes i will they've been abandoned and rejected by sheep laughed at by sheep even the clothes they where they picked on the way they designed the church they picked at it they've pointed fingers at their family when their own family is in deep trouble you sheep straighten up amen because when you're in trouble guess who you call to help rescue you [Music] don't love your pastor when they come to rescue already be loving them it'll be a pleasure to rescue you [Applause] honor needs i tell you heaven culture honor there's love and honor honor is the second biggest thing in heaven culture you have to honor each other don't fight over what you don't believe or agree on talk about what you do [Music] every single one of you have gifts and god put them in there we need each other we are not an island to ourselves you cannot isolate yourself when you isolate yourself now i'm not talking about when god calls you away to himself he does that he used to do it to me all the time but i still had to come back in the mass and the tribe i lived in and love them and care about them not everyone in my family is happy about me no is that is that amazing i'd have to say half of them are excited the other half don't care someone come correct me i just love them i ask god to bless them i have their face at my war room and i loose the holy spirit on them all the time then there are some who are part of what i do then i gotta be there one-on-one with them where they learn to guard their soul and lose stuff from their soul this is a new time on the earth we need to live a new way okay you need to be like jesus he changed his very appearance the holy spirit was very close to him before the earth was made and they got consumed with all of us they would do things together there's a whole area beyond heaven i call it the retreat even they need to get away sometimes that's why you need to do that when god calls you apart to be with him that's one thing but getting away just to have fun is something that's just as necessary have fun with your family for heaven's sakes they need to see some fun let's all say this father i ask for it and receive funds to have fun when it comes i'll use it to have fun because that's why you're sending it we are his children we can ask more than just our basic needs being met you have not because you asked not people always think that's the spiritual side of everything but we live in a physical realm in these physical bodies it needs to have a break you need to take a break even jesus took a break from the disciples of heaven's name he needed it hard-headed i know what it's like to live with fishermen [Laughter] i know in scottish fishermen i know the scottish ways very well [Applause] and i'm irish and jewish whoa what a dynamite yeah it was quite interesting we'll be married 40 years next year it's been a wild journey [Applause] marriage is bliss in the good times in the fun times always that's why god sends the angels on assignment with the opposite kind of personality they're not given a marriage nor married they are not unhappy about that the ones that chose it before on the earth have regretted it ever since but he'll send the serious ones with the comedians there are comedian angels i have met some they're the ones that give you those awesome jokes to tell that's them [Music] that's that's who they are and they do it on assignment and the holy one profound one does not want to hear the jokes they are focused on their assignment well so is the other one he's just enjoying it while he's on it they sharpen each other and then god makes it even better he sends them home on sabbatical to have fun at the front at the playport they have a playport it's in the sky then they have to go and have fun together after they completed their assignment [Music] together you're going to get a whole new view i'm going to come and just speak about angels one time you will laugh most of the time and then you will pray for them i'm gonna keep reading i'm listening if i ever write people go you need to write a book of angels if i did it won't be what you expect we'll have the section holy profound the fun they have them i'm going to just start sharing what he said he wanted me to talk about how he made america and the people who made america great god's always had people and he would he would assign them he would anoint them is that strange he anointed people that weren't even believers he gives anointings the anointing draws people and that's why people have the ability to influence people it's an anointing sometimes the enemy gets ahold of those people and they are anointed still anointed he doesn't take the anointing away but then it draws people to the darkness and that's why we have so many dark movies and dark songs because they have darkness in them because if they were filled with light that same anointing would create amazing fantastic things that's why he's getting hollywood saved [Applause] [Music] i'll be going there next month [Music] i have a key to hollywood a key to l.a actually he even showed me the seven golden angels that stand around uh la the ones that the city was named for [Music] los angeles the city of angels the first time i went i saw them and this person who brought me started taking me to significant places so i could tell what i saw in the spirit realm i saw those seven angels they were taller than mountains and they had these vials standing over the city waiting to pour them and they poured them before i left because god had was pouring out an anointing on hollywood to help show the truth and bring light and change the producers directors the scriptwriters the special effects people [Applause] hollywood is right [Music] [Applause] they'll still make intense exciting adventurous funny movies but it will not have darkness or evil in it and if it has evil they'll be overcome and defeated by the good in there not everyone will be a bible movie but the whole the whole life of heaven and what god wants to be seen and lived on the earth will be portrayed in every movie there'll be goodness there'll be power there'll be light there'll be hope in all of them yes the blessed coast and so yeah a lot of stuff was planted in california i laugh every time i hear a prophet say it's going to fall off the face of the earth i just saw it fall off into the ocean went well you didn't see a literal thing you must have seen the darkness falling off into the ocean [Applause] he's always had people in america that would make america great our forefathers were some of those we grew up we my age grew up in school knowing the truth about them and what they did for our country and they always talked about god they talked about god we prayed every day in school remember those days in the public school we prayed [Music] that's because god created america and then he anointed people who paid for america to be great people have usually talked down the people where great wealth those people great wealth help build this country they're people who built whole states they founded host states the beginning of host states but two very wealthy people who founded almost all of florida and paid for all the universities and the hospitals and the great places and uh many the beautiful structures and buildings they were they were paid for for about two by two people so he would he would choose people with great wealth and anoint them and have the wealth because they put it back in the country he's going to do that again he's already he's already picked up people to do that and then god said in america i mean you the people he meet the people in america and he said then i set up a miracle i'd be run by the people for the people he put those words in there that was him to have freedom of liberty to worship him to separate the uh the um the government from interfering with the church not the other way around separation of church and state church is first separate church so the state cannot interfere with it that's true then what he himself talked about the gospel he had me put in there the notes i had already he already given me two-thirds of the gospel that's not for me that's from him was paid for by people in america other countries were involved they always happened great revivals happened the welsh revival there's so many in scotland where my husband's from the covenanters those people were the holy people in scotland they were powerful powerful people in ireland i can't even begin to tell you about ireland with colombo and patrick and they had friends of angels angels were their friends and they didn't worship them they sent them on assignments bangor island ireland to this day is called the valley of the angels and they still see these luminous angels in that place because of the price people paid to pay theirs so they had prices paid somewhere in our own country there was a 100-year non-stop prayer meeting and people would work for each other just as they could be in this this cycle of prayer they were crying out for god to come to this country and do something a 100 years before we were here before we who were sitting here were here they did that people have always paid a price here in america died many of them died even in the founding of it and then he made america to stand as israel's friend i already had that in my notes to stand and be a friend of israel and sometimes we weren't always that friend but that is going to change [Applause] it will change many things will change he said i established and made and birthed in america america is different from almost any other nation it is that's why they all want to come here and i know they love there's some that love where they are but people who really want true freedom and liberty they come here for that liberty and freedom there's a lot of very good moral people that come here because they know they can live they're not coming here so they can be beat up and die they're coming here to actually have a life yes and to get born again they're going to get born again i've seen i've already been shown millions at a time will run into the kingdom [Applause] millions of muslims will run into the kingdom [Applause] he didn't tell me that he showed me that he he he cannot ignore who ishmael was in case you wondered this where that whole thing came from he's not gonna he's not gonna ignore ishmael and who his father was right he said he even said they would be mighty in the land and they are they need to know the true god he said he birthed in america and made in america liberty and freedom to worship god in america more freedom in america than any other country if you don't believe that go visit the other countries there's more churches in america than anywhere someone came to our town i think we have like a thousand they came for the super bowl one thousand volunteers were all from the churches they had a plan most places that uh the super bowl comes they have all these party zones everywhere i mean everywhere's party party not the good kind of party and very little things for families we had mass family zones all over our city for all the people who came to the super bowl so they could have fun with their families we had one little tiny area downtown somewhere that was the other party zone and the super bowl committee said they would come back they had never seen such harmony and unity between the volunteers and the people in the city and they were so excited about the the thing that we welcomed all the families we had stuff at the beach we had stuff for the on the river all over our city family zones when god is in your city it is what happens amen and then he said i'm going to share some of the i'm going to give some of the first for america it's important to know about your country our military i i love that you were blowing was that the bugle what were you blowing yeah that was so god because i already had down here to talk about the military my boy this whole group is just they're all hearing what was in my notes or what he said himself if you don't have a church in this area come here he said the military he said i birthed and patterned the military here after heaven's military they have a military they have an army michael that's his job in heaven he's the archangel over the host he has a military headquarters in heaven they have barracks 200 and some feet high i couldn't see the end of those barracks and they were designed and created for one thing to destroy the actions of the army of darkness so they didn't have a job for a long time and now until lucifer decided to take over they didn't know what they were going to be doing they sure did their maneuvers really well and it's not a tourist attraction in heaven by the way people go there they don't stay long they're far too busy to stop and chat with you so now they've all been sent down here isn't that exciting for them said our military was raised up to care to care not just for this country but other countries he said america has gone and defended almost all the other world leader countries that stood for justice and freedom even the small ones who had nobody even the smallest countries they went there even if they weren't thanked they went there because we we don't like injustice our military my husband is a marine he will always be a marine he forgets embarks order sometimes i don't listen to them if i get a kiss i will listen [Music] [Applause] i am not your squadron do i look like a squadron i will show up in fatigues if that's what you want me to wear i will wear them all the time you want me to look like this then i better get a kiss [Applause] [Music] if you think god just lets me run up and ignore my husband you are so wrong you need to get our dvd and cd called passionate power yep it was something he had me activate no my husband i have to make him happy make him feel important and let him have a good time and fish as much as he wants to even though he smells like bait i celebrate when he catches a fish and when i'm gone he sends me a picture every day that's his gift so god designed uh our military he wants he wants us to have a strong military because as long as evil wicked people in the world that want to just kill destroy you have to have that strength as part of your protection and protection for others and he said they stood the our military stands for uh righteousness which means uh in order to be in the military uh tell you they deal with those who are not keeping their self in order because when you're in the military you live military you represent the military as they find out too much stuff is going on you are in trouble they want you to live right because you know that's why you're there to fight right so righteousness justice and liberty is really the hallmark of our military we need to honor them more they're going to be respected in ways we've never seen before in the future one other one other thing and and actually the father absolutely loves nasa because they show us all of his space art nasa introduced for the first time to this world god's art in outer space maybe you never thought of it that way that's how he thinks of it it's not a bunch of dust particles that came together he designed every one of those nebulas spoke them into existence and then the lord of glory made them the word stepped out and made them every one of them is put in a specific place that's why the planets aren't all falling out of the sky and by the way there's a difference in using the word universe and the word cosmos universe is just the universe it is not necessarily made by divine design but the word cosmos means a creator designed it and made it [Applause] the bible calls it the cosmos man came up with universe same thing but it is the cosmos designed by a creator and perfect design i like that word cosmic we're going to have some cosmic times on this earth [Music] nasa was birthed here in america and made in america the greatest place space exploration facility in the world was in america other countries pursued it but america made it a part of them it was also funded and paid for by the people in america we paid for all that stuff that went on and it meant something because it wasn't just discovering new places and images there were so many things created just in the course of making that possible that we all enjoy now new technology we never had before new products we never had before on the earth that increased safety and excitement and let me tell you just if you've never looked at those galleries you need to go online to nasa.com which now get this since the space exploration with humans is done they're still setting the hubble and the other one out there we're learning more and more about what god made out there so they're not they haven't stopped doing something if you ever go to the nasa center in florida it has turned into a huge facility where you can tour it learn things experience things see things they even have kids space camp to be a junior astronaut so they've not wasted all that money we've spent but they have released 99 of all the photos for free and you can get them and put them on anything and you don't have to pay for it from nasa if you go to the nasa galleries you can download download if you want something that's high def and you're going to use it for something specific you may pay a little bit for it but most of it because the people paid for it they gave it to us how about that so that was something that was made in america a first in america was nasa and then he said some of the greatest inventions and scientists were homegrown in america or america drew some of the greatest to our country because of the freedom and liberty they had to create and we have worked closely with israel and their brilliant minds that god gave them and some of our creativity worked together to bring things to this country and this time god will bring listen to us the jewish business leaders together with american business leaders to do contracts with them to do contracts in business and do projects together for the first time god is introducing and birthing and releasing in this time the kingdom age from america we're going to go ahead and pass the baskets we're going to work she's going to keep going so if you guys want to uh bless her and be a part of the offering we're going to go ahead and pass the baskets and we understand if you have to go but we're going to let cat keep going so yeah so we're going to pass the baskets all right thank you for the commercial thank you god for blessing everyone who gives to what you're doing in this time [Applause] increase them in any way every way god and i'm i am still believing and declaring the thousand-fold return the hundred-fold and thousands of return especially if you call them to be in business god let their business come into fruition let it be in their hands let them see the plan one last commercial make about to go m.z gomez gateway on mount zion then we'll just give her one check so she doesn't have a whole bunch of checksuits god is uh one another thing made in america or birth in america is the revelation and details about the kingdom age is coming from me i live here details on heaven culture and how to live that how to work with the host of heaven as your weapon and i know it's happening in other places but the fullness of the of the revelation and the detail on it he is birthing here from america as a pattern we will be a pattern the believers who live here will be a pattern for the other believers to run after that same pattern because then they will prosper and flourish and push back darkness god always raises up a type of people when he introduces something new in the earth we're it that's why you're sitting here that's why you're hearing these words so he's birthing the kingdom age the fullness and understanding of it jesus introduced it but we've never really seen the fullness of the kingdom or even understood what it was it's in all of you if jesus christ lives in you because he's an orchestrator of the kingdom age he releases it from you it's a lifestyle it's a lifestyle you live in this earth prospering and using it to build this kingdom or take this message of the kingdom because the message of the kingdom has power in it yeah it does it's the gospel parents grab your children parents grab your children there get your children it's releasing revelation as a pattern to follow to rule and reign with christ to use our powerful weapons including the host of heaven remember they're bored they have nothing to do they are not defending heaven they didn't even do anything about when lucifer fell and one-third of the angels god himself kicked him out he's always reminding the devil you have lost yeah [Applause] then his son reminded them in hell on the third day when he wasted them [Music] he wasted them in hell demonstrated that not only he had power and authority but all those who follow him have the same power and authority that he lived in it is ours now it's our time to demonstrate through our life and receiving and choosing this lifestyle we will demonstrate that same authority and power over all the power of the darkness it's because this is a new time this is exciting i'm ex i'm getting excited yes he said he said um because of what america has stood for and was created for to bless the world to be a light to the nations to become a pattern of heaven on this earth that is all of our calling to represent heaven on this earth it's wonderful to live in heaven but if it's not your time you are not going anywhere [Applause] our life spans are going to be extended in the kingdom age because we are that generation and type of people that will taste to the i'm talking about the power when jesus lives on the earth and sits in jerusalem on the throne man's lifespan will be extended for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years but there will be a generation on the earth a taste of that the power of that age well there's only one more age after this one it's the millennial age so we are that people that will experience and taste of the powers of the age to come so everybody stand up please that's why you are so important to god and the people around the world that belong to him you are important to god we are to represent heaven live heaven culture in this earth operate like christ did on this earth to bring hope jesus brought hope god is not the author of doom and gloom it is not time he could not possibly put his wrath right now because we wouldn't be able to do the things he wants us to do this is not the end of the end it's not the perilous times this is some of the greatest times on this earth oh we are totally getting the wealth of the wicked there's many ways he's going to do that i know one of the ways that we will do that is by the things we put in the marketplace that they can't create and they don't have they will race after those things in the marketplace i was sitting there today and you said the world will race after made in america products [Applause] especially china i don't know how they feel about that [Applause] i can't leave without telling you to be very careful about what you're buying check out what you're buying make sure it's a good product make sure it's not going to fall apart or explode there's other countries that have been allowed to bring things into our countries that have no guidelines for their products not even their own people are protected and they're putting they are they're putting asbestos in formaldehyde and let even in toys you can get a little i'm just telling y'all the truth okay you can get a tester you can buy a little tester i don't know where it is sometimes they give them away free probably go online and look for them i i'd go in the store and i would look at everything i'm not doing that to put fear in you i'm telling you that to protect yourself and your children that's why we need stuff made here now other countries like england and france and italy and other countries are other good solid countries that make amazing products that have guidelines for their materials but there's others that have started flooding the marketplace that have no guidelines and they shouldn't allow them in here without checking them out they should have to have the same guidelines do you agree i'm sure everyone agrees but people are not aware that almost 80 percent of all the products on the shelves are not good things i look at every label it takes a while even some of the food now is being sent overseas to be processed i will give you a tip organic farms will explode in america organic farms if you can go organic go organic they don't use pesticides they don't use fillers they don't use hormones in the in the meat and in the animals you know a long time ago they didn't really do all that until they wanted to start mass producing stuff well one of the things that will be changing in america is the way we process stuff even ourselves is going to get better i'm not telling you not to eat i'm just telling you be be aware of where you're buying stuff they have organic markets and if they don't have them you contact them and tell them to bring them here we actually ate at an organic restaurant in denver it's called mod market i'm giving them a free commercial fresh from the farm and the i think the mills mall it's near that uh that restaurant that has the bony fish on it i won't be going there if you like fish go there but we ate there and the food was delicious and it was fresh all of it was fresh so it is increasing if you if you see organic you know make sure it's a responsible company but organic farms are going to explode because there is a generation my two of my daughters fall in that 30 year old category and they refuse to give any of their children anything that is not they eat healthy they are healthy and every now and then they let them splurge you know they don't say you can't ever have a pizza but if they do they get an organic one learn to make them yourself because you can buy stuff and make good stuff amen i don't know where that came from i guess god cares he cares about you but our marketplace will majorly change in america all right we're going to all look up to heaven and we're going to do it what the lord said we're all going to say god bless america three times god bless america god bless america god bless america father right now i just impart to all of your children here god the desire to prosper and flourish and be in hell we want sickness and disease to be far from us we want prosperity to fall upon all of your children father the blessings we bless our friends everybody say i bless my friends i bless my family i bless my enemies go sick them holy spirit say i receive revelation so i can be creation [Applause] a new creation that lives heaven culture that loves god that wants his way and his will and don't forget to send the fun [Music] we love to just look up in the sky and and watch what was happening and when kat began to talk about fun i showed margaret the birds were going nuts did you see they were all of a sudden there was a whole bunch and they kept flying by and having fun and then the eagles showed up who saw the eagles oh yeah they were just going so they creation responded to that

everybody i hope you're having a great day we are right here in sunny florida and yes it's actually sunny by the way that system that the weather warriors took authority over last night is like gone gone it's gone so thank you everybody for participating and because all of this that we do belongs to god we're going to start with everyone out there asking for grace so you're going to learn something before we start our q a session you actually should do this when you first wake up in the morning i'm talking about grace for abundant life maybe you never heard about that but it's definitely in the bible there's actually a scripture which you know that should be maybe a homework assignment for everyone who's a part of this there's a scripture that says god said as a child i filled my son with my grace now this is god the father speaking it's in the word of god he is also the one who has the throne of grace jesus christ gives grace for abundant life god gives grace god jesus you all know of course that i'm up very early i didn't wear my shirt that says you know what does it say i'm not a morning person i'm not a morning person and i know you're like weirded out by this but this is my morning right now this is my morning okay now if you called me at six am i probably wouldn't even have gone to bed yet so i'm doing this because i love you so christ gives grace for eternal life that's eternal life grace that's when he died on the cross he gave we got that but the father who sits on the throne of grace come before my throne of grace to find grace for help in time of need that is abundant life grace and you know there's an action it says find it that means you come and you ask for it so as a child god the father filled his son with his grace for abundant life is one of the things that helped him survive on this earth okay that's how he could still be happy filled with god in heaven abundant life grace is fueled from heaven if you will look up to heaven every morning when you wake up and you say father i ask for and receive grace for this day like right now i feel it it feels like light electricity pouring into me a lot of people don't know this is something you can actually get every day and it's like new every day and so we're all going to do this together so everybody even here in the studio say it after i do so everybody can know they have to do it father father i ask for i ask for and receive grace and receive grace for this day for this day amen amen there you go now we are all filled with grace what does that mean that means you're going to be happy things aren't going to be bothering you for whatever you're going to go through that day you just got grace for that so you could live abundantly because christ comes to bring life and bring it more abundantly please don't forget that if it's the only thing you leave with today and i talk to you just like you right here in front of me and being 1 to 15 i have no problem communicating with people and i love people because you know i survived them was triumphant living with that whole family with our alligator in the bathtub and you know umpteen toad frogs that my seven brothers would go out and collect and my mom would have to set them free every night um so we definitely had a different household so i love all of you if you're bashing trash you know we're gonna have to we're gonna have to ban you um but we love you anyway so i'll say that right in the beginning i love everybody even those who don't want that you don't understand don't be filled with fear that god has more and it's called revelation so that's what you're going to get today as we answer these questions that you are asking and jen will take a couple from the comments you know we're gonna we're gonna we've already got a few that we're gonna answer because we've been promising a long time so we're gonna get started so uh and i do have a few more things to share later but right now we're going to start the q a session awesome let's have it jan we are ready you guys can't see me but i'm over here off to the side hi okay um all right so this question is from sharon it doesn't say where she's from okay sharon yes and uh she would like to know that since there is no night time in heaven are there bedrooms in your mansion okay i'm sure everybody heard that but this is from sharon a question from sharon she wants to know since there's no nighttime in heaven i don't know if you knew that but there isn't you know there's no shadow turning there's no darkness at all and having the there's different colors that come in the sky different times well there's not time in heaven just waves of color come to the sky of heaven which would sort of change the effect of the light coming from god himself all light in heaven comes from god there's no sun there's no moon in heaven so there's always daylight there's always light and you don't have per se a bedroom in your mansion because no one's going to be sleeping you do have special rooms in your mansion where they have beautiful lounges for you to lounge on sometimes people want to go in there and and you still go and set yourself apart to read the word and even though god is everywhere in heaven his presence is with you some people just go to a special place in their mansion and just have conversations with him sometimes your special friends visit you and so you do have like the most beautiful place the most comfortable place in your mansion would probably be like your area where you're going to lounge and relax and so but per se is a bed you don't need that and people think how lovely and wonderful well let me give you a clue in the nurseries with the millions of babies there's many nurseries all over heaven they don't sleep either can you imagine being on the list to be one of the angels that care for these little babies and you have to play with them all the time because they don't sleep either but it is wonderful to think that your body doesn't have to be restored all the time like we do on this earth your flesh needs rest and sometimes some people need more than others i sleep four hours a day sometimes three i go about 20 hours a day then i'm going inactive and my family's adapted to that but some people need eight they need 10 hours i'm so glad that i'm up for 20 hours so let's go to the next question jen okay this is there's no name on this one at all but um they wanted to know what is a cherub what is a tear-up oh that's the first time i've been asked that well it's part of the angel tribes in heaven and a chair of people normally on earth if you said the word cherub and this is an anonymous question so hello anonymous whoever you are [Laughter] you ask you did a rare thing you asked the question no one's ever asked me before it talks about the cherubim now it literally says the cherubim in heaven people say many different ways uh actually the cherubim are very different creatures in heaven they are part of the angelic tribe a chair of most people shows a little fat baby angel i have never seen any in heaven i'm not saying they aren't there i've just never seen a little fat baby angel naked no not that either and uh but a cherubim is fantastic they have eyes and all their wings they're very uh powerful beings and intelligent beings in heaven and like the living creatures it talks about in revelation 4. why don't you all go read revelation 4. guess what you get a lot of revelation about heaven itself that's when john was caught up into the heavens and he was in heaven itself and saw many things he actually saw the cherubim in heaven around the throne that had many eyes and their bodies and their wings but a cheer up like people i'm sure and all the valentine cars people i've probably been buying there's probably little baby cherubs holding a heart or something like that but but normally that's probably just in heaven if you said cherub that would be short for cherubim that would be an abbreviation for true of them who are anything but little fat baby angels so there you go that's all i'm going to give you today about the cherub they're part of the angelic tribe there you go and i'm waiting on the next question next question okay this one's like a long list but i'm not going to read all of them i think we need a drum roll for this yeah this is one person's one person now we love it when you send and ask us a question but it's kind of hard when you ask 50 or if you send five paragraphs to ask your question um it's just go to the heart of it and let's hear what okay so this is from paulette in new york hi paula from new york and she she sent seven questions but i'm only gonna do i'm only gonna do one pick one right now and maybe the other ones will show up on a podcast or something okay okay um i had it picked out where is it okay here we go where did the other races of people come from which that's a bible story so i guess she's wanting to know paulette wants to know where did all the other races of the people come from i assume she definitely means on earth right so you need to make sure you say earth or heaven where did the other race because there's races of people who died and moved to heaven too so for me i need a little bit a little bit detail so where did the other races come from on the earth well at one point there weren't races they didn't they weren't even divided into races they just had people on the earth and everyone spoke the same language and everyone spoke the same language which was kind of wild if you can imagine so everyone who'd been born on the earth at one point there was a point on the earth when everyone spoke the same language but we don't do that now and the bible does talk about the tower of babel which did happen it was something that it happened where god uh decided to separate the races and give them different languages and you can imagine when that did happen that some people after they could understand everybody for so long and back then people lived a very long time and you know i know there were some people who lived actually to be 700 years old i think enoch was only 300 that was like young back then so back in this time when for for years and years and generations had gone by everybody understood everybody and yet in the moment of a day there came a time when a lot of people didn't understand everyone else and only certain groups of people i'm sure he chose whole families and relations to those families gave them a different language and that caused those people to separate create their own groups of people and maybe even move where they could all be together so they could understand each other all the people on the earth according to the bible adam was the very first one and it talks about adam being the first man on the earth adam and then of course he created eve they were the first ones he put them in the garden of eden a lot of people know that part and then of course they had sons and then the population began to build but there came a point and it was at the time of noah that this happened this certain thing happened that that was when he got wiped out the earth because the people were so wicked so evil can you imagine that there are probably hundreds of thousands of people on the earth that they were so evil and wicked that he only kept noah and his immediate family and they were kept on the ark and the bible says from the time of noah onward everyone on the earth came from the lineage of noah so i can say what i know as far as what the scriptures say that from the time of noah everyone on this earth is related to him because of course everybody else was taken off the earth and people newly born on the earth all came from the lineage of noah so i can just say that and there was a time when the groups of people were separated by god given different languages so we'll just go with that for right now uh there is some things i may as well just add this to cause discussions between between all of you there what there are some theories that people believe after adam and eve god kept creating people now i don't know and if you find it in the word maybe you could inform us in the comments i can't find it in the world where it says every single human being came from adam and eve because the the race was all destroyed but at one point when noah was saved the word does say that from the time of noah everyone else on the earth was related from the lineage of noah so there is this possibility that people talk about all the time that god could have made adam and eve he could have made other people on the earth because he was really trying to accelerate populating the earth and there's always questions like well who did adam and eve's sons mary who did they married was it their sisters was it someone else where did other people come from i think we will all probably wait until we get to heaven to get that question answered so there you go next question okay this is actually from facebook um this is specifically for you and um they must be maybe new people that haven't heard stuff from them okay yeah there's always new people you need to consider that i'm going to add this for free there are people who find me and that's what they say it's very funny i found you on youtube i found you on facebook or i met you on youtube or i met you on facebook i met you on twitter i met you on the podcast for the first time and now we have instagram and now we have instagram hey so we're really expanding out there and so every day throughout the day there are new people discovering me so they don't know a lot of the revelation those of you who have been watching and listening for 10 years you know a lot but you still have to consider here's some new person who's watching maybe just found me by accident like oh my gosh look at that person she's got pink hair but she's talking about god okay so what is the question well it's from jonathan and patricia and it says do you leave your body when you visit heaven oh that is a very good question jonathan and patricia jonathan and patricia welcome to our q a session and that is a wonderful that's a wonderful question they want to know that when i am caught up to heaven do i leave my body because some people think where does your body go does your spirit man go and that'll give me an opportunity to answer a couple other things to make it clear i don't go in my body my physical body stays here on the earth my family all know that because if they come in my room or if i'm sitting in my desk or something else if they come up and speak to me and there's no response at all i'm just like staring saying nothing they know that my spirit man is in heaven so i am caught up by my spirit and i am taken to heaven i don't make myself go okay god's never done that with me he's always just caught me up either by the spirit of god sometimes jesus comes and just catches me by my spirit when i'm in heaven i don't look down and see my body i don't look down i am focused on what they want to show me in heaven and yes this has been going on for a long time for a very long time since early 90s i've been caught up i had got off to heaven taken on tours of heaven for the purpose of revealing to the earth what heaven is like how heaven operates what the people look like what their mansions look like places that are made in heaven things you get to do there what about your family members all kinds of things god has me reveal and i actually have a commission i he came to jesus came to me in person face to face and said the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and guess what i didn't say no so it is my spiritual body and this is why it's wonderful i know for sure jesse duplantis go check him out jesse duplantis he lives in new orleans or right outside new orleans louisiana he literally was caught up in his physical body and taken to heaven if you if that happens to you you will know now i know that you know paul didn't know but a lot of people at that time probably hadn't been caught up to heaven if you're caught up in your physical body your physical body is not accustomed to the glory the power and the life of god that is in heaven and eventually your physical body would get weak in heaven however your spiritual body that is is all spirit it's made out of light heaven itself is made out of light it's a building substance so everywhere you go in heaven in your spiritual body you can touch the ground you actually sit in your mansion i have guests in your mansion you travel all over heaven you know on light or sound you enjoy a literal life and that's the proper way to say it so every time i go to heaven i experience everything that is there but it is my spiritual body and when god is done he sends he brings my my spiritual body back zip right inside my body and then i'm aware of everything i have every memory of being there the smells the emotions the things i saw it's all retained because your spirit man has a mind okay your soul which is in your spirit man is what you express emotions from it's what you gather information with so your spirit man and your soul i was caught up to heaven i have both of those my physical body just sits and does nothing so there you go here's the answer all right next question is from bonnie and it says do people who accept christ on their death bed have big elaborate mansions do people on their deathbed have big elaborate mansions in heaven that's really um more than one question but i'll go ahead and answer that question the bible clearly says that god will reward us for our lives lived on the earth you're not going to escape being rewarded by god now what some people think of as a reward may not be the the powerful supernatural reward that we get in heaven and the thing that he loves the most is if you used the gift he put in you like whitney houston she used her gift she sang she used it all the time it blessed god she got she gave herself back to christ the night before she died and let me tell you what she had fantastic reward in heaven i didn't see her mansion but i was actually caught up to heaven and i saw her receiving rewards from the father at the throne this was right after she had passed and you know what this is the other thing whether you have a massive mansion because you really gave your entire life every hour of the day you helped people loved people you use the gift he put in you you ran your race holy on purpose they're going to have fantastic mansions because they gave more of their self now you cannot work for your salvation i have to say that that salvation is free and there is no one in heaven that is sad disappointed or upset so no matter what they ended up with to live in they were filled with joy with celebration with excitement because of what god had made for them but god is a just god and those who really served him loved him and loved others and was forgiving all the time and didn't live with the fence in them of course their mansion is going to be fantastic i have seen mansions in heaven that were the size of new york city i hope that stretches your mind on realizing how huge heaven is it's fantastic it is amazing there are sky mansions mansions under the crystal sea there's an amazon forest and amazing i just say amazon to give you an idea uh there's like massive trees that would be the size of 12 massive trees here they're like 500 feet high there's wonderful beautiful things there so there's there's like forest there's the mountain of spices there's passionate paradise that's about the love of christ and worshiping him so many places in heaven with many different mansions i've never seen a shack or just a little cabin if someone had a cabin it was on the property of their amazing mansion and family members do live right next door each other but when you come home to heaven you don't come as somebody's husband or wife you come home to heaven as the father son or daughter and he makes sure everybody gets a mansion so absolutely i've seen such amazing beautiful mansions and they were the mansions of little grandma intercessors that prayed in their closet and prayed in three or four moves of god forgave anyone who came against them just poured out their life all day for god and even though no one on the earth knew them god was quite aware of what they were doing for him and he rewarded them powerfully but everyone in heaven celebrates the fact that they're there so next question okay next question is okay and i'm only going to mention this because this is like a major topic with a lot of things and a lot of people have said if you don't do this specific thing you won't go to heaven oh this is a good one yes and if and i know what you're going to say so of course you do you're my sister and i've known you since you were a baby but i love sharing this too because it debunks so much stuff of why you get sent in we are myth busters today yes and it's important to do that so people know the truth it says the truth will make you free and we are definitely filled with truth and revelation from the father so we're going to do it right now this is from anna and she would like to know do you have to be water baptized in order to well she didn't say in order to go to heaven but oh okay but it's necessary to be water baptized okay but you can expound on that foreign if you don't get baptized you won't go to heaven if you don't tithe you better you know if you don't go to church yes there's many things um over time that has been developed in the mind of man and man and if you do not many times have revelation from god or the scriptures aren't open to you or let's just say you never read the bible you need to read the bible the true word of god okay and people go what translations do you read i'm just this is a free tip from catker i love the amplified bible i read that's on my desk i have the king james version because it has a lot of stuff that is truth in revelation that's not even put in other translations i i love the amplified i love the everyday bible that's an older bible i absolutely love my main reading bible is the scofield bible because of all of the comments the commentaries that are put in there the revelation that god gave that mr scofield that that really explain and expound with revelation on the word of god so i would definitely say the niv the king james the amplified the everyday bible i'm trying to think of some other versions of it some my my husband likes to read the one that's more like everyday language it might be well it's not the enemy if he was here would ask him but i'll find out let people know later because they're always asking me which ones are okay there are newer translations however that leave out some of the word of god some aren't even a complete bible i'm not talking about just the new testament it's great if you start with the new testament i also love the not just the historical part of the the old testament but the miraculous that happened hey people the parting of the red sea all of that is real when elijah was on mount carmel okay those powerful things that happened way back in those days are exciting to read when you see even god's hand move back then the new testament of course is about jesus christ what he did for us the acts of the apostles did you know that's what the book of acts was about is what they did operating in the word of god the power of god that jesus christ gave them when he raised up these apostles under him but there are some newer translations there's every kind of bible out there trust me even ones that are not good okay that you don't want to read and by the way this is for free also free tip do not read false religions words like their bibles like it's not wise to fill yourself with the quran it's not wise to read the book of mormon it is not wise at all to read the satanic bible none of these things are about false religions that do not believe in jesus christ his blood that he is the son of god or they leave out main events that are going to happen there will be a tribulation i've seen the timeline of god that's embedded in the floor behind his throne and these things are going to happen the millennial reign of christ which you could also say the thousand-year reign of jesus christ on this earth it will happen by the way that's quite a ways away from here i've been taking over 100 years into the future we're still here so that's also a free tip you're not going to be you're not going to be raptured out of here in the next few days or the next few years it's not going to happen in 10 20 30 40 50 60 i just could gone it's going to happen when the father decides what will happen but if you get a bible and it does not include major acts of god or events that god has already ordained will happen he needs these events to happen for his purposes don't read a bible that leaves major things out especially accountability especially where it talks about sin make sure that you repent of your sins there's all kinds of stuff going on and it's all kind of teachings literally in some churches they teach that you don't need jesus christ to go to heaven or that everyone's going to heaven no matter what they've done or the whole world's going to heaven i promise you the whole world's not going to heaven but you give yourself to jesus christ you find a word of god that is supposed to be like a plum line of decisions that you make sometimes it will help you learn how to pray how to develop an intimate relationship with jesus christ so i'm glad this question was asked so there are many different translations of what people call the bible and if they're not a whole word of god the whole new testament or the whole of you know the old testament or just both of them together that's not a truth that's not all the truth you find a word and you find the church that teaches the whole truth you can't leave the holy spirit out of your life he's the third member of the trinity he is god also so i can tell you right now the bibles i read have the whole council of god in them and i've talked so long i forgot what the original question was is it necessary to be water baptized and i didn't even answer that question and he just went out but that's okay i would have wheeled you back in when you were so worried you know why the word of god by the way it talks about being water baptized yes it's in the bible you give yourself to jesus christ repent of your sins okay because you're not going to heaven if you don't repent and i'll tell you why the father told me he's not letting evil wickedness and sin into heaven that's his home he said if i let everyone come to heaven without receiving my son heaven would be just like the earth and you don't want to live in eternity in the earth right you're going to live in heaven and i need to i need a break just a minute okay it is necessary to be water baptized because that is an outward representation that you gave yourself to jesus christ and when you do that it's like you died with him that's what it is when you get when he he he wipes away all of your sin and fills you with him okay water baptism is an outward expression that you received christ and your sins were wiped away so it's like you died and were resurrected with him in him and now he lives in you and that's what water baptism is that's why it is important to have it done however it's not going to keep you from going to heaven okay if you don't receive holy spirit of course that is such a power living in you he will become your best friend he is my best friend holy spirit is and and he tweaks me all the time he makes me laugh he shows me things to come he opens up the word of god how do you get him the same way you get christ you receive christ first and then you invite holy spirit to indwell you and let me tell you he's not going to say no so these are all a necessary process because when you get saved it's wonderful the salvation is free you have grace for eternal life your name is written in the lamb's book of life but it's important to do these other things because they increase your intimacy with christ they open up the knowledge and the understanding of god himself so water baptism is showing and let me tell you you don't have to do it in church a lot of churches have a baptismal they'll be glad to do that for you but i know people who've gotten baptized in horse troughs and swimming pools yeah one of my own dollars was baptized in the swimming pool at this private school that allowed everyone to come they had ceremonies and they did that they just baptized you in water and let me tell you the most important thing it says if you believe on jesus christ you shall be saved but being water baptized being filled with the holy spirit finding a good truth speaking church because it says to not forsake the gathering together of yourselves that means you can be part of a prayer group that means that someone who has a home church you can attend that some people watch church online and they give and tithe into that place wherever you are fed whatever feeds you in the word of god if there's somebody who does that whether it's a church a prayer group it could be a school of the spirit go where you can get more of god so it's not absolutely necessary because i will go back to the same thing that jesus said to the thief on the cross yay the thief on the cross the thief on the cross recognized that jesus christ was the son of god and he received him by the words he spoke to jesus himself remember me when you come into your kingdom remember me because he knew who he was but the other thief rejected him guess where that thief went okay this thief on the cross received jesus christ and christ answered him and said today you shall be with me in paradise now at that time when people who were accounted just and righteous because they they recognized god and received him then god kept them in a place in the earth called paradise it was down here it was a spiritual place a beautiful place so when abraham isaac jacob when all those great men women you know esther ruth when they passed they descended into paradise or abraham's bosom and it was not hell it was not hell that was for the wicked dead so i can tell you that because the thief on the cross he went and when and later on in that day this is when they're hanging on the cross this happened all right uh when they when the thieves died when they both died the one who rejected christ went into hell the other thief was in paradise when abraham's bosom which you know according to the word when christ's spirit man left the cross he descended into paradise or abraham's bosom he preached the gospel to all of them because according to them they their messiah had not come yet so you're getting a lot of scripture right now it's important to know this though so abraham isaac david all those righteous men um that would also be joseph you know the one who raised jesus these people before christ died on the cross ascended after he wiped up hell according to colossians he wiped up hell on the third day he spoiled and ruined prince valors and powers melted them okay and he took the keys of hell death and the grave from lucifer and then at that point christ rose up got his body back his physical body back so if you want to know is your spirit man busy can it see and hear and touch and feel christ did all those things in his spirit man descended into abraham's bosom saw the thief welcomed him greeted him like he said he would and then preach the gospel to all those who were there they were held captive in that place because heaven had to be chris had to pearl his blood on the altar in heaven and everyone sins from that point when they repented and you got forgiveness when you died from that point you just you ascended into heaven and abraham's bosom was cleaned out he led captivity captive and they all went up to heaven with christ so that changed everything that's why it was necessary so christ to do that so does that because this is another kind of you you answered someone's question i was going to ask okay but they just asked a further question um about paradise yeah so is it uh is it temporary or is it no longer existing paradise was like i said it was another word and it was called both places in the bible called it said abraham is more paradise it was the place where the those who were counted just and righteous by god because they believed in him and this is before christ came to the earth and died for us it was a place that was created so they had a place to stay and live there was buildings there was a river i've seen that place a beautiful place that god kept his that he counted as just and righteous it was emptied out when christ went there when his spiritual body left the cross and he went into abraham's bosom met actually he met in person abraham isaac jacob king david solomon adam was there the only ones not there were elijah and nina they actually were taken to heaven itself by by god the father he caught them up and took them in their physical bodies so they they were the only ones up in heaven besides all of the angels the living creatures um god you know the father or son holy spirit they all lived in heaven but after that happened it says in the word that people no longer descended they ascended christ descended for us and he cleaned that place out by preaching the gospel to them not hell okay he didn't go there to preach the gospel and then after he preached the gospel then he went over to hell christ did and then he was there and it says in the bible for three days he was there and then of course we know what happened on the third day and then christ after he was done wiping up hell taking the keys he went back up to the tomb got his physical body it was glorified instantly which is what we will experience on the day that dead and christ will rise our spirit men our spirit bodies have been living in heaven that's us will be rejoined with our physical body it will be glorified that means you can never sin never fall never die never get sick that you will be immortal it says mortality will take on immortality that's us we're mortals now we may be supernatural morals but to come a time in your life because of your receiving of jesus christ that you will be immortal and that's scriptural so there you go so it's empty abraham's bosom paradise is empty now there's no one yeah because when you die whoever owns you oh comes and gets you comes together and that's the best way the father said to me the first time i've got to heaven when you die whoever owns you will come for you so make sure you are praying for all of your loved ones who don't know christ because god gives us promises in the word and it says because we are believers who have received christ and bleed christ that there are things we can ask him if we don't doubt in our heart but believe what we say will come to pass then we will have whatsoever we say and the greatest thing you can do with that scripture is stand and say i stand for the salvation of my family members for all those who don't know christ i declare they will know him love and receive him and that we will be together for eternity that is a powerful declaration but once you've prayed that for them don't talk about how bad they are okay you don't want to do that that's like being double-minded if you're declaring they're going to know christ pray for them love them you may not be able to validate what they're doing don't validate their sin okay every time you see them love them and just tell them god loves them keep praying for them but it's a powerful prayer for a believer to stand for their family members because it says you and your household shall be saved and so that's because you know christ but uh so that answers that question very good um let's take a quick break oh yeah we want to uh tell everybody what we're going to show them yes we're going to take a little break and let you know we have some new things that we are going to we've been doing actually and one of them is called cat on the go and you become a part of my life where i'm going what i'm doing and we stop and make a little mini video and share that little piece of life so we're going to take a moment and let you see one right now hi everybody this is pat on the go and here i am say hi welcome hey everybody yeah we're very busy so we won't be talking to you very long but we're here discussing illustrations of the things that will become images in the resurrection movie is that right right it's exciting isn't it to be a part of it but it is a lot of work trust me it takes hours to do this you know we have to make sketches and he takes it makes it look amazingly beautiful okay i don't do that part he does and then we come back and there's edits and then he has to change things and i change things and he changes things but it's going to be amazing when it's all done and we can't we cannot we cannot wait to you know take that throne that throne that satan's been sitting on hollywood he's going down people going down god is taking it and we are doing this back again i hope you enjoyed that and so we did these cat on the gos different at different times on different days but you will enjoy every one of them so what is the next question um well this one's a bit of a tough subject and i the question flew by really fast so i didn't catch who asked it but um someone uh i think it was their nephew or something has recently committed suicide and they feel they're in heaven and um i didn't get to like i said i didn't get to read all of the question but what is god's say about that yes what does god say about when someone commits suicide so that is a very interesting question for me exciting but now you go that's just weird this is exciting not when god has caught you up on purpose to give you revelation yes and i have revelation on suicide i never knew my whole life now there were really strong christians i knew growing up and then later in life and they were going through a horrific struggles and they they ended their life and i inside knew that they were in heaven some of them i saw later in heaven and so the father on purpose said i'm going to show you the truth about suicide and he said first before i catch you up you're going to go to webster's dictionary and look up what it says about suicide and i was quite surprised because we all know people who do that what they call suicide what is called suicide people are either under horrific stress or trauma and it can be physical emotional or mental there's three areas in life where the enemy will just bombard you and crush you until you no longer can stand it and then people in their life take their life and everyone tags it suicide but god doesn't do that god is just and righteous so when i looked up the word suicide in the webster's dictionary it said someone who commits suicide is in their right mind with all of their senses they are knowledge of their mind their will and their emotions they know exactly what they're doing they're not in trauma or stress and they take their life and god said to me that would be like a terrorist or a suicide bomber there are people who plan on purpose in their right mind to on purpose die and most of the time our last time that is to hurt other people yeah like let's say um 9 11. okay all those people who are involved with the the death of all those people when those planes hit the buildings they knew their life would be taken that was suicide these people willingly knowingly got on those planes to on purpose go kill people and end many people's lives and that is called suicide what people this is the father speaking to me what people are experiencing they're not ending their life they can't bear the pain they're in whether it's mental emotional or physical sometimes people are in accidents the pain has agony the medicines sometimes the medicines even will give you thoughts of suicide and some people just can't no longer handle the suffering and god said they don't want to take their life or end their life they're ending their suffering and he said to me i would be unjust especially if this person had received my son and they couldn't handle the suffering they were ending the suffering he said i do not send those people to hell and i do not call that suicide and so therefore that is a very important answer and the first time i released that people were in shock but it makes sense because if somebody knew christ but then some tragedy happened to them whether physical mental or emotional that wasn't even their fault and they couldn't bear the suffering so they all they want to do is go home to heaven this does not give you excuse because you're going through a hard time to to take your life to go to heaven that's not right but people who are in agony on strong medications going through trauma's therapy you know when they get to the point where they cannot handle living they end their suffering and after he taught me that he took me to heaven and showed me three different people and i think it's even in one of my books where he talks about this whole thing about ending your suffering or taking your life there's a difference so you know a terrorist suicide person someone like that that is suicide but someone who's ending their suffering because of the trauma even some children do it teenagers older people people every age suffer but this is the good news if at any time when they were still in the right mind if you can get them to choose to lose i was just going to say i will tell you god was so adamant about this that he told me i'm going to put despair on you for a week and you will not be able to bear it and people go why would he do that so i would totally understand what people are feeling when they get to that point and he said right before suicide there is despair despair when you get into despair there's no hope no way out it's absolute agony in your mind to even exist and he said i'm going to put i'll let you experience it and he he literally put despair on me and for a week i would go climb in my car this was years and years ago he did this and i would all i would do is cry out to him i couldn't bear it i let me tell you i couldn't think right my emotions were a mess physically i had no energy i couldn't even think of a way out but i knew in my mind this was something god was letting me experience i think it's the only way i actually survived it at the end of the seven days he just came and took it off and joy and celebration flooded myself he said i don't want you to ever forget that is what people experience when they go through oppression depression deep depression then there is a spirit of depression on people and then there's despair after despair gets in then that's when the suicidal thoughts start coming people need to not keep that in them that's why he tells me god says don't even let sadness be in you do not let sadness rule your life most of the time you don't even know why you're sad you need to say i choose as an act of my will to lose all sadness all oppression all depression [Music] all despair and for some people you need to say this i lose every suicidal thought from me i will not keep it in my soul and then you say and i choose with my will to bind the life of god the love of god the presence of god his joy his celebration those i bind to my soul and no one can take them from you i hope this really helps somebody today but it does give hope for all those if your family member was in agony in the end of their suffering i promise you and especially if you made a stand for them to know christ they will be in heaven this is the hope we have and a promise we have from jesus christ and people tell me sometimes you don't talk about jesus he is my everything he is my number one my husband is my number two and that's not ever going to be changed don't run out in the spirit and become so supernatural to signs and wonders and forget who gave you the right to do that we can't go through this life and be successful and happy if you do not make jesus christ your number one before you start looking for someone else to fill a void in your life make sure jesus is there first so i think we're probably going to have to end this i might take one more question quick one one more question and then we have to go on to something else this is from i hope i'm saying this right it's um karina and she would like to know if you have any insight on tattoos this is another good one i love these ones i have revelation on because you know um earthwise time i've been around for a while may not look like it and i think like a child because the more i know god the more i act like one and think like one but for years i was told that tattoos were a sin a crime against god a blaspheme in leviticus it talks about them it says you shall not mark yourself and so people let me give you the revelation god gave me that scripture was talking about the culture of that day this is in the old testament in leviticus in the old testament it said you shall not mark yourself with the marks of the dead now in some of the new translations they may have changed that scripture or say you will not have tattoos on you but that's wrong because that's not the great translation god does mark people himself as invisible was a tattoo it is a visible permanent mark he marked cain in the bible remember that when he had even killed label but so people would not kill cain god put a mark on him letting people know do not kill him that was a permanent visible mark in the bible it says some people will mark me mark me put my marks on them and so there are people who have a permanent visible mark on them we in this time and age we call that tattooing and let me tell you even in heaven when you get there it says god will put his mark in your forehead the name of the city of your god will be put a permanent visible mark in your forehead and it will be put in the palm of your hand this is in the word of god people so heaven puts permanent marks on you it also says in the bible that god will mark 144 000 jews that will do powerful things for him in the last day so what are you going to say to those people you can't go to heaven because you have those marks on you there will be people that will put marks on their self because god has even asked them they will not represent hell okay these marks cannot represent hell because what you put on you says who you serve yeah and so that part is very important as signs of things that represent death or hell should not be put on your body and if you had that done a long time ago i would encourage you to go back and have them changed i do know that it's possible i do know this in this great move of god coming where the fire of god will be loosed over people he will actually erase a lot of the other kind of tattoos off of you but you cannot put that as something you can't just put in a box because that scripture in leviticus says in the culture of that day they were marking themselves with satanic marks all kinds of people back in the way back in the day in the old testament they were cutting themselves and cutting off parts of their body and giving them to idols worshiping idols okay it also says you should not cut yourself uh you should not worship a false god all this was the culture that was taken place back in the old testament in this in the leviticus in those days so but it does say you should not mark yourself with the marks of the dead i will also add this if you're young and you are still living under the covering of your parents don't run out and get one just because i said that to you when you are on your own if you want to have something that represents heaven revelation that is going to be your own decision when you're out on your own but don't do something that's going to call cause grief in your family or strife in your family okay make sure that that is going to be okay with with god and if you're under your parents you honor your father and your mother and let me tell you i always did that and if god ever tells me to get one i'm going to wear it i keep saying i may get it i'll make it if you got better on my face it'd probably be would we a wing of the living creature with eyes in it or something but right now i'm not planning that but i need to give you truth and that is true that marking yourself in today's world they would call that a tattoo it doesn't it's not all jesus has wrong jesus himself has on his entire thigh has written a permanent visible mark that says he is the king of kings those are spiritual kings and the lord of lords so our own lord and savior has that mark on him and god has used it in the past and present okay to let people know they live for me they represent me so go you be powerful re please run after jesus christ first get revelation ask for revelation yourself and we're going to end our session right now so that i can go and do something our q a session and go into something else and i hope you have a blessed day and i release the life of god in part the life of god the joy of the lord in jesus name and so we're going to go on to our next session yeah we're just going to switch we're going to switch topics right now and we're going to talk about the guardian zone yay we love our guardian and we love this because this is a plan that god gave us again the things that we do no matter what those things are if god creates an event through us or a move of god he's starting he has us make a mark or a logo for it because he's marking it as his it will cause a move of god with whatever that purpose is and we love it when he does that and for years because my book was actually written in 2005 2006 my first book and he gave me a deadline to have it published by may of 2007 and it was i actually met that deadline and it wasn't easy because i still lived with all of with my family my my mom my mom my sisters a couple of my sisters lived with us my niece my daughters my husband and i we all have one big home together and i had to write that book in the midst of that so all you people that god have asked you to write you don't have an excuse you find time you do it he wants that he needs that message given to people whether it's just to make people laugh to give them a revelation on how to do any ideas and inventions let's say it's uh it's powerful revelation on the word itself uh maybe a prophetic book about things to come you have to step out and start that book and i had to write it we're living with all of that stuff going on in my own home it was never quiet i never had any really quiet time and it's a good thing i do stay up and my my greatest creative time is from midnight to 4 a.m is when i in those hours that's when i wrote all my books just when i do all my sketches most all of them are done during that time and so sometimes you just have to find a way to do it by the way at our our events we have different events and heavens invitation this is going to be for free right now heaven's invitation is coming up in june and we will have a pr a free author how to become a published author or self-published author workshop and when you can get something for free that is a good thing and there are different methods that you can use to write and you stick to that protocol but let me tell you only 10 of all books that are started ever get published and it is possible to get published so i want to encourage you in that moment but i'm going to talk about the guardian zone and the holy spirit and the father dropped this in my spirit and we actually designed a logo several years ago which represented the guardian zone and and that image that you're going to see or you are seeing right now it represents two flows something is flowing in so it can flow out so as the support and supply comes in that's your giving then the revelation can go out and what people do when they join the guardian zone you're a member but we call you a guardian how about that god does love to give titles i know man talks about not having titles but god is really big on giving titles to people especially in these powerful days we're in now so you will become a guardian by your continual support in giving your financial giving and we actually have people right now on phones that you can call this very moment and they will answer the phone they take down your information and how you would like to give it it doesn't matter if it's weekly monthly you know it can be annually whatever but most people choose to give monthly or or weekly whatever god puts in your heart to give whatever is in there to give it it helps us to release more revelation like the studio it costs money okay it costs money and you'd be surprised probably if you've never done it what it costs to do things like this because we have really good cameras now we have professional lights we have an awesome media desk let me tell you what my one sister my one sister hello patty uh paid for this media desk knowing what would be used for she will get reward because of purchasing this for so we could have a professional looking desk to do all of our media and our broadcast we're going to be doing webinars really they are going to be coming up we're going to do webinars we're going to do all kinds of things from here we will actually have weather warriors weather broadcast we have a green screen that's uh we're setting all that up so we can do stuff with the green screen and there'll be a point where we do weather warriors and you literally will see on the green screen the weather the destructive weather or the threat of it you'll see it on the green screen and as we're declaring and decreeing over you may see things changed immediately or we will come back the next day and show you the actual thing that happened let's just say a big tropical storm is coming and it was building and growing it was really getting bad and we all take authority over that in our with our weather warriors group from all over the world now we have people in every country now that do this um and it's gonna be powerful and by the way i might as well just tell you we are planning a webinar for weather warrior training instead of making everybody come here to do that we're already working on setting all that up sometime in the spring i can't give you a date at this moment but we will have a webinar it will cost a small fee because we will need people to be here that aren't normally here we'll have all kinds of other stuff that we'll have to have and things going on it will not be very much but let me tell you it's cheaper than flying getting a hotel and having to sit and wait in between the events it will be powerful focused training on how to be a weather warrior and you will be so filled with it and trained with it no matter what comes up anywhere and if you see or hear something coming up in the world that is destructive you should take authority over it because you're over the weather not under it so there's my free clip that's just one of the things that some of our funds are used for and some of these funds that people are you're giving right now that's what the guardian zone is is helping to support heaven's plan to release heaven on earth and create products that represent heaven on earth and put them in the marketplace and you have to supply for me because i don't get a big check from a church somewhere you know i love church by the way i'm going to give a plug to church god is not abandoning the church he's going to settle set it free the ones who are teaching deception like it's okay to send all you want to you that's called deception uh pray for those people but don't stay there okay the church is the way god designed so that we could all have members to be together to fellowship together to break bread together and to help each other it's very important we have many revivals in the past it wouldn't have been possible if people in churches involved in church were not there and so i do know there's a lot of home churches as many new ways god is doing things we're in a new time in the spirit realm and in god's plan so i'm all for home churches churches and offices these are people who teach the word they they pray for people they have prayer groups intercessory groups schools of the spirit now schools of the supernatural it's just exploding everywhere so there's many ways to get to know god get more of god but these funds that you give us help to provide provide for me personally and to help take revelation places we never could do it before and it helps us to put new materials out there for people so i really appreciate every person and many people have responded to become a guardian and i'm just going to share a little bit the numbers are on the screen right now to call and like i said we actually have staff right now waiting to take down your information if you'd like to become a member of the guardian zone and you don't want to go online yourself to do it you can actually call and they can take all your information and they will sign you up in the guardian zone and then what you're going to get is i send revelation reports to you at different times throughout the year i have special gifts that are being designed as tokens of our appreciation that you will receive and every year you will get towards the end of the year you'll get a real beautiful collectible item from my heart to yours and you will have god's blessings on you because this is heaven's plan and so uh people have all kinds of questions sometimes about this god is not against people giving especially if it's his plan and it helps those who are pouring out their life to do what god is asking and if people around this world weren't willing to give their life to christ not just receive christ but spend their life giving the truth praying for people i know powerful men and women of god that are out there right now around the world helping people and giving to them if they're doing that is a god thing people complain about paying tithes or giving offerings or you know the bible is free the bible itself isn't free actually unless you go to a group like maybe the salvation army the gideons you probably can get a free bible but all these bibles are being the wonderful ones filled with truth have all kinds of helps in them and things that people spent a lot of their life doing translations in different languages for different purposes we probably eventually i don't know when we'll probably have a revelation bible filled with revelation on the word of god itself and the times and all those things right now he's got me on many different platforms doing things but i can tell you those who are doing it and then they put that in the bookstore to be sold you cannot walk in a bible bookstore and just take products out of there and walk away and say i'm taking these free it's like going to anyone who has their business and this is how they make their money and i want you to know that even jesus made money on this earth he had a business he was a carpenter he didn't give it away for free that was his living paul worked with fabrics and i know he did make tents but he also made banners and all kinds of beautiful things he made a living even while he was ministering and when christ was ministering i'm sure there was a point where he did stop doing that but it's okay to be in business and minister also at the same time and so you go to the store and you go to places all the time to spend your money you're getting what you paid for but here when we do things like this and every day we're putting stuff out there i i believe right now there's probably 500 hours on youtube of me talking about heaven on every kind of subject possible and that we do not charge for that we don't charge of course for facebook uh all the stuff we put out there when i go and speak you know when i go places i'm invited to speak sometimes they have to charge a fee because they have to run to place they have to pay security they have to pay the ushers they have to pay people to come and be a part of that and so i can hear the phones ringing right now that makes me very happy but even ourselves in our own events that we hold every single year we will not ever charge people to attend those events that means that we are taking on all the expense and i'm just going to give you a tip because some people never know if somebody goes and they're going to hold a big event like in a hotel unless it's a three-day event and it's a major hotel they could be paying 20 000 to rent the space in that hotel because this is the hotel's property you also bring most of the time your own equipment like your speakers your microphone your technical technical stuff you have to carry and take it into these places people are really blessed if they find a church that might let them rent the church to have a meeting and so that's probably a little bit less expensive but i know we ourselves in the past we would pay like twelve hundred dollars a day to be at the marriott those meetings we held there they weren't free for us but we didn't charge anyone that's something god ask of me personally so our main events which would be heaven's invitation that's heaven inviting you to get revelation that's always in june okay then we have the dread champions that is the manifested sons of god that is for men and older teens teenagers boys uh that is just for them and they have powerful events with the men and then we have the wonder women that is our all women event and i can tell you what we shake hell we shake hell we send the armies of heaven all over the world we had people women from 40 almost 40 different places i'm talking about countries that come to these events it's always going to be usually the first weekend in november and so uh we are already putting stuff out there to save the save the date for these meetings that are coming up we're already making major plans for them and of course weather warriors will also be an annual event and uh like i said we're we are right now creating a webinar where we can do that and people from all over the world will be able to join on that webinar we will get the dates to you as soon as we have it all set up like i said there'll be a small fee you you'll pay that to join us you'll be given a special link to go to so that you can watch it and only the people who up who will sign up for that event for that webinar they will be able to see it and be trained powerfully it will be over the course of two days that we will have that this is something new for us but we will begin if i mentor my mentoring in the future will only be done the webinar so it's going to be very powerful that we have this source of media to use so i'm just giving you some tips on what do we do with that money okay i am not just by myself i'm not sitting here alone by myself i have staff all around me i have staff in the other rooms of our office right now one day we will have a huge place because god has already shown me that and i do know what will happen and eventually we will have staff and facilities around this world but this is where we are starting okay uh my my family you know we still live here because right now this is where god has us so it's like we're in our office 24 hours a day that's what it feels like sometimes and so it powerfully helps us you know god blesses us and the word talks about giving offerings and sharing i don't usually go into that part of it it's what is in your heart if you receive revelation if it has changed your life we will eventually one day actually have a program that does nothing but share testimonies from around this world of how revelation has changed their life it's the more of god it comes from his self it's from his throne and we love sharing that a lot of my staff learn to adapt to heaven culture that's what we call it and we explain in many of my messages out there you learn how to live heaven culture you learn how to take authority you learn how to work with the army of heaven you are trained because it is our job the bible says that the fifo ministry is here to train you we're not supposed to just share a few good words and sing a couple nice songs you need to lead changed okay we go from glory to glory by getting more of god and then applying it if you receive if you go to church you get a powerful message and they give things to inspire you and to help you that means you apply it to your life and so i tell people i'm not here just to talk to you i'm here to help change you and trust me until you are walking in the spirit okay that means your flesh has died to itself when you walk in the spirit it blesses the heart of god but your life begins to be it's like you breathe him in and you breathe him out walking in the spirit brings life okay it even says that in the word of god walking in the spirit is not partnering with hell not tolerating hell in your life all that stuff is true in the bible there is a hell i have been there and seen it there certainly is a literal heaven i've been there and seen it many times and god has powerful things for us right now in this slide so make sure you call the number on there and you join the

and i was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it looked like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause their soul to prosper all the time and then they'll live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering here so cat um well those of you who don't know the lord's been taking her to heaven for several years and showing her things and bringing her back and allowing her to share with us so let's just welcome cat kerr [Applause] your soul is one of the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well i'm this and that no adam became a living say it loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to god that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life is probably one of the least talked about things in the church is a soul growing up i always heard that it was bad went but god made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul how why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with god and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your soul is fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody can wound and hurt you and it stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand i was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time i never usually know but i looked at my clock and i was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it looked like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause their soul to prosper all the time and then they'll live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that word be means live it's called divine health so i since i learned about this the father taught me about that he said people can lose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you lose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can lose from your soul and he said i know most people bind the devil with the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talk about the loosing thing what are you going to do with the leucine key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of god to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about god will never be taken from you and so people i know you know you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it i'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to lose that that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out say what's loose on earth is loose in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of god as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're going to do a soul checkup i hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming i hope you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're going to do some spiritual warfare with the host they'll be excited you may leave with an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're going to have some fire sent the angels already outside waiting but they're going to do that tomorrow night i did this recently where i mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time to start getting i want to say drops of it the fire of god is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our god is a consuming fire i'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of christ send the fire i want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart i mean literally makes your your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with god the fire it burns it out and then he puts himself in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from god too stones of fire i find in one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that satan left on some other planet was in the bible and i already knew what they were so god made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is i'm like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to lucifer okay they were inside god or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the river of life that's in him the river flows out of him the gems

good morning everybody [Music] this is almost my morning [Laughter] how many people don't know me or know anything about me anybody got dragged here [Laughter] i'm so glad you're here i prayed for you a long time ago that people would understand heaven is different they live differently there uh hair color is heaven culture i didn't ask for this i am not a paint care person well i am now but years ago when the lord came to me in person because even as a child i would say if jesus ever comes to me in person and asks me to do something there's no way i'm not saying yes this is like an eight-year-old okay so i was strange even back then i've been a seer my whole life i was born with that gift that does not belong to the enemy most people when you mentor mention the seer or the spirit realm they think you're part of the new age movement no it was around long before the new age movement was here okay it belongs to god it's sent from heaven he needs seers on this earth and he needs prophets that are seers more than anything else because we say what we see whatever he takes us and shows us the difference between a prophet and the seed of prophet is we actually get to see what he's saying not just hear him say it therefore we give details and i can assure you what i say to you today will be things he told me or showed me or both and maybe things you never heard of before or even thought of before but i speak on behalf of heaven on this earth that is my commission it's not my gift my gift my passion is photography so you see before you a photographer minding her own business which is now god's business remember when jesus said i must be about the father's business remember when he said that i understand what he meant when he said that okay because he had the life of a carpenter correct say amen he was sent is a carpenter corrupt right he was then as a businessman and he knew who he was long before he got to that place of being a businessman god loves business people because they have openings that a lot of people who are in you know if they're christian leaders or in any way associated with a christian i don't like to say religious because god's not religious he wants a relationship with you and even that is sometimes new to people that never heard that man man created religion christ created a relationship he died for every single person right on the planet he didn't die just for a denomination and saying that i was part of the assemblies of god almost all of my entire life and grew up in that atmosphere which was awesome we had holy spirit we had the gifts working we had miracles we sent missionaries all over the world i helped to serve at our family church not my dad's church but it was our family's church i'm from a family of 15 children i'm number three that means i died a long time ago i also can read your thoughts just a tip i belong to jesus christ since i was four years old that was well over 60 years ago i forget how old i am because i don't look at age god counts time by events and so he chose me for a certain time on this earth to do things and say things for him i never asked to be caught up to heaven he decided that i was going to be a photographer i was going to work in business i loved working with ceos for over 25 years i was working in business he took me out of that at one point in my life and he said i'm gonna prepare you for what is coming and the next season of your life he didn't say it would be to be caught up to having non-stop to give revelation on what heaven is like i would have done it anyway because by that time i was besotted with him i sought him earnestly on purpose fiercely for over 20 years now remember i was born again at four this is when i'm into my 20s by this point in my life and in my 30s i really passionately and i raised three children i'm married there's my husband of 43 years sitting right there y'all pray for him okay he has to live with me i'm not normal [Laughter] you can't be normal when you've been to heaven as many times as i have been there this is not really reality to me standing here this is a vapor in time your life right now is a vapor in time your future is going to be so powerful and great and grand and i'm not just talking about when you get to heaven i'm talking about because of the time you live in right now one of the most amazing fascinating powerful times to be alive on the earth is actually right now and anytime god before he did something great the enemy showed up to try to steal that time the enemy wants his time his time is not yet and the father would tell me all the time he's only given satan a bump in the road that's what he calls the tribulation in the paris times and there's people now even saying they're not going to have that they're wrong i've seen god's timeline part of it and he is going to have those things happen for his own purposes he needs them to happen in the earth they'll be for a short time but the times we're entering into now will be for generations maybe you didn't think that again i've seen 50 to 100 years into the future and the mere perilous times had not happened the tribulation had not happened and i think it would be better if we stop saying he's going to come tomorrow i will say he's going to come when the father tells him to is the correct thing to say christ is coming back i absolutely believe in the rapture i absolutely believe that those times will happen but those aren't these times we haven't even done the works alone the greater works christ passionately said certain things would happen and some of them haven't even happened he's not willing to wrap it up and end it in the midst of darkness amen things are getting greater and greater and more and more powerful in these days we literally will learn to rule like christ did in the earth the bible clearly says don't tell me what the word says i know what it says people better know what it says it says we will rule and reign with christ now say now and in the time to come we will that's who we are we have authority as believers if you're not a member of the body of christ you have no authority you have no authority over satan you have no authority in the spirit realm you have no authority to speak for god if you're not belong to jesus christ and you have not had your sins washed away you are not righteous i hope you say amen god does not agree with it's okay to sin all the time whenever you feel like it that's right god does not agree with once you get saved and if you if you sin and keep on sinning the grace will cover it that's only if you repent that's what the word says is that correct christ is righteous and just if you repent of your sins he will cleanse you from all unrighteousness is that what that says that means when you sin say you're not saved when you sin something happens in your soul when i have you say it that's why i do that when you sin that makes you unrighteous when you repent he wipes it away and you are righteous i just as blunt as i can be i i love the truth i live by the truth i have to myself it doesn't matter that he catches me up to heaven all the time shows me mysteries takes me into the past takes me into the future i know what his heart is i know what his words are i know what his ways are i walk in them i know his will is not always what ours is the best way you can live is his will his way not his will your way he he desires so much for us to attain to everything that christ won for us this is one of those times where we're going to rise above our lives and all the way we've been living in the past that doesn't mean he won't desire holiness in our life that means we'll be doing things we never dreamed we would be doing and therefore when he's going to do something like that he has to clean the platform off a platform of man that platform of the enemy and crush the enemy and push him back so that we will have freedom to move around this earth not just in this country which by the way will be absolutely not just restored but almost reborn this is not the time for america to go down the tube and end we are this is what the father says you are a baby country you're still a baby you have begun to walk in all that i desire and i created you to do in this earth you are it will be a great light to this world a place where people can come to know my son a place where they can walk in the glory that is created by those who love me a place where people come to see the miraculous as a normal way of life amen a place will come to america not to find the american dream but define me a place where prosperity will happen because two-thirds of the gospel has been paid for by people from this country i am not going to ignore the cries or the prayers of my people they are precious to me they allow me to give me permission to move and operate on their behalf and even over those who would take steal and try to steal cheat and steal and take this country away if you're interested the father calls biden a villain you should say amen a villain in any movie is the worst people who promotes and carries out evil deeds and the father is well aware of everything that's going on behind the barbed wire and he's not going to tolerate it because of the importance of these days for god for his son for holy spirit in this earth and especially particularly a miracle because it helps others know and learn about jesus christ and let me tell you that is not going to stop happening they have carried the message of the gospel of the kingdom they will now begin to carry the knowledge and the power of the glory he is not going to give up his time for the glory to be seen and known in this world there's actually scriptures written about the glory of god the number one is christ in you is the hope of glory do you know what that means that means you will begin to create glory for god and you will carry that glory amen literally the light of god will come from you that scripture also means that you will release that glory and operate in that glory how do you think the knowledge of it is going to go around this world we will demonstrate it things beyond your imagination are the days we're stepping into because of that god won't even send new creations and inventions to this earth because he's not willing for the wicked you have them say amen he's well aware of everything that's going on he's not oblivious to it it's not that he doesn't care he does care he just has a plan amen and it may not line up with man's dates that they keep trying to give that he's going to do something they were all wrong or he would have done it he won't even give me a date he'll say i'm going to do this and i'll say god's going to do this it doesn't bother me that it doesn't happen for a year or several months or even weeks i've waited 45 years before for him to do something he promised me and i never gave up and he did it amen my family understands faith we lived by faith god was welcome in our home so his holy spirit so was jesus christ he was our healer you got 15 kids you need jesus as your healer from being shot point blank with a shotgun to being bit by deadly spiders from being hunted by people kidnapped and then brought back we stood in faithful albums and every one of them we had victory why can i not stand for a few months to see god act in my country and in my nation this is not just about america this is about the whole world right now he is exposing evil all over the world in great detail and most people will be shocked and i promise you you will know what was going on you actually see the evidence hear the hear hear the testimonies see the videos of the horrific things that have been already got they already have the evidence right now this moment i'm standing here they have the evidence and i will promise you this trump is our president if you don't want that you need to lose something out of your soul because you're fighting against god not trump god picked somebody who couldn't be bought who couldn't be forced who couldn't have fear put in them who could not be controlled he picked him on purpose and he picked a businessman he has already proven himself that he loves this country and he loves the people in this country and there's actually you should know by now persecution comes because the enemy doesn't like certain things the persecution is the proof that you're going to get what you ask for you have properties and lands and blessings in this life with what say persecution you should always rejoice when persecution comes that means you're doing exactly what god wants [Applause] it's really evidence i rejoice i compass and say man you should be rejoicing and dancing you've got all that persecution you're going to get something great from god and he never saw it that way i said that's how jesus seems he wasn't concerned at all about persecution he didn't care that the religious hierarchy didn't like him he was a threat to them he was also a character when he walked in this earth he was funny people loved to be with him even sinners i'm sure he captivated them in revelation they never expected to hear they heard words they never heard before and it made them burn inside people burn in heaven because of the revelation they live in in the parts of god they see you never got to see they get to see parts of the future they get to see parts of the new earth they saw how things were done by god way in the past before even the physical realm was created your family members are living in the greatest place possible they are happy they're rejoicing they're blessed beyond measure they have mansions no human hands can afford to build your mama and your dad your grandparents great grandparents don't want to come back not because they don't love you but they're one of the one who loves them the most you can have the understanding of that love it makes it a lot easier to live in this world when you see it through christ's eyes when he was on that cross dying for all of us and he understood that people didn't understand they didn't have a clue the ones who were even reviling against him at that point he died anyway didn't he what little is it to us to die to our flesh sometimes if we have a choice to be kind to someone even if they're being mean to us it's one of the greatest things you can do to pierce the enemy you pierce the heart of the enemy when you love instead of fighting back against people when you're kind even when you're spent is fought upon or mistreated or wrongfully accused when you choose to love doesn't mean you're just being foolish it means you're piercing the enemy your worship also pierces the enemy it goes right through the second heaven maybe you didn't know about that satan has built his own little tiny tiny kingdom up there he sits on a throne of skulls and he rules from up there because he's a prince in power in the air so he can do things in the spirit realm the spirit realm is both both sides are there all the time this is not heaven all right you're not living in heaven right now we're having more heaven sent down than ever before that heaven is not deserved and neither is hell heaven is beyond your imagination with the glory with the beauty the splendor the creativity the wonder of being there in his presence all the time with him you ride on your worship across the skies of heaven into the throne room you're transported through beams of light from one side of heaven to the other the food is everywhere there's no weight gain or food allergies on heaven everyone is young there is no age there is no time there's amazing fun exciting things to do because the father is a father it says you must be like a little child because when you get there you're going to be shocked to see how many fun things he made for you [Music] you may be 90 now but you feel like you're 9 when you get there there's laughter everywhere in heaven people love it it is love because he's there and he chose this time not us many people are in fear they shouldn't be if they belong to him he actually said i have not given you a spirit of fear but of power say power i want you to notice that's the number one thing he says has given us he gives us power that power he gives us as a believer is over all the power of the enemy that means no matter what's going on around us we have authority to speak against that you have authority to speak against anything the enemy is doing to you because jesus gave us that every demon should run in fear when you get up in the morning hell should tremble when you open your mouth and speak things to people amen because you have authority in your mouth you have the word of god you have the power of god you have the life of god you get revelation you have you have his plans his will for your life he chose you and put you on the earth that's why you're here right now no matter who you were birthed out of you were birthed from him first and he went down his timeline and chose when you would be here because he needs you here so these days are going to be different than anything we've ever lived before i've already seen these days i've seen well into the next 50 years that should be normal so i have no fear of anything he holds my life in his hand and the father holds the breath of every being on this earth and there are some so wicked he said all i have to do is remove it and they're out there are some very wicked people in this world right now they may not live through this yes god has done that before in the past he wiped everybody off the earth it was so wicked as bad as it is right now it is not as bad as it was to the tase of noah i know people think it is but it's not it's i'm not i talk about those horrific things that they did back then but there are people wicked enough to want that to happen and the thing is when the enemy finds enough and he's actually found a lot of humans who are willing to do things his way but the enemy's already lost because this is not his time even when it is his time he's not going to get what he wants because even those who are believers at the time of the tribulation and the parasites will be some of the strongest believers ever walked on this earth they won't even be afraid to die i know i've seen the movies from the time i was young i've seen the movies about you know during those days how bad it will be uh nobody will be forced to take the mark the mark is not the michael chip you can't see it that mark satan's going to put on people will be seen three blocks away because he's full of himself and he wants people to know who gave themselves to him so that won't be something that is forced on anybody he wants people to willingly do that and right now he's found a lot of willing people but it's still not the time for him to have authority in this earth therefore god is going to take and wipe the platform clean not just in america but he will remove evil from many different places and high authority and leadership in many different countries around this world i know everybody said well we're going to have the harvest it still won't be the final harvest the first waves of harvest we get those people need to be mentored to walk in the supernatural and learn how to roll with jesus christ so we don't know how to do that how are we going to mentor them we can't be normal we cannot be normal you can't live your life every day like it's the same you live your life with passion and excitement that we've been given great authority actually he gave us the earth amen we are stewards of this earth we're stewards of what goes on around here and god said i will allow what you allow i will not allow what you don't allow that's also in the bible so why are we allowing things everything you say from your mouth is written down you should go back and read the scripts i started counting my words a long time ago because i see scribe angels writing things down about ten years ago i woke up and there were two things sitting on the end of my bed and then one scribe angel looked at me said we have been sent for the words of all the leaders in the body of christ at this point now we will write down everything they say whether in public or in private and from those words are speaking god will decide who will have a leadership in these great end days and who will not have leadership those who will operate in power and authority those who will not allow to operate in power and authority if there's sin in their lives they will not be allowed to operate not in these greater days of glory he said people can fake many things they can fake being in the five-fold ministry they can fake by things they say and yet they're sinning behind the scenes but god sees everything that's right he's not watching you to hit you over the head with something he's watching you to see what is in your heart what do you desire to do for others that thing to esteem others more highly than yourself goes a long way in heaven i was raised that way my dad was raised that way i'm from seven generations of believers who actually believed i was the one who didn't want to be known or seen by anybody i was not someone who would put pink in my hair was the quiet one watch out for the quiet ones they're thinking and they're watching all the time i can just tell you god had a plan for my life i had a little plan i was going to get me a nice apartment and be in some big company because i loved working in business i'd like to see things happen and god had another plan no i'm going to give you pink hair i'm going to take you up to have a non-stop and you're going to go all over the world and speak to everybody you're going to hug them and let them kiss you on the cheek if they want to i was not a person that wanted to be hugged or kissed by anybody and yet i mean been kissed thousands of times by people around the world you know greet each other with a brotherly kiss that kind of a kiss so he's changed me he's changed the way i think the way i look at people i look at him through his eyes he loves you more than you ever ever can imagine no matter who you are even what you've done even with your failures with your mistakes things that you gave up on he has not given up on you and he has not given up on this country amen he has repeatedly told me america is not evil it isn't america itself is not it's one nation under god and he says that to me all the time it's my country it's mine and he said in 2015 i put my hand on the country and i turned that map red and he had already declared that trump would be president for eight years knowing every single thing that would happen and god says oh no he means right now not talking about in 2024 he's talking about right now he said to me trump won the election he didn't lose that makes him president the other side lied and cheated that disqualifies them he said if in the olympics they are caught cheating they are not congratulated they are not honored they're not rewarded they are removed and they have absolute all the proof they need that that happened just because the civil courts wouldn't hear the cases doesn't mean justice is not coming and i can promise you trump knows all of this he's not been lazy he's been very busy behind the scenes so are many other smart smart and intel smart people around the world that know what is right and what is not right and they don't need any more evidence than they have to take all of them to prison or be shot for treason these i'm speaking truth not making it up this is true trump is still our president he won the election uh on the election date and when they said we're going to stop the counting the holy spirit who is right beside me said that's really going to cheat and steal and change all the votes he said that to me right when they said those words we're going to stop the voting we'll pick it up tomorrow and then we'll see what happens well by that time almost 80 million people had already voted for trump yes and if you'll notice you never saw biden's people he never had rallies because he had no people but they didn't know what they were going to do they knew from the beginning they would cheat they already had their plans laid out that all those the voting machines and the dominion system already working on their behalf and i know most of you weren't aware of that but they switched so many votes overnight that before trump can switch them to biden and finally there's one county that is given permission to recount have 2.1 million of the ballots looked at individually all over again to make sure that they were counting but that's still not how he's going to be put back in office there's already things that have happened even in our military i will tell you this that the ones who are sitting there illegitimately god says are illegitimate in in dc he says the ones behind barbed wire that's how he talks about him [Music] are still hoping we will give up and let them do what they want to and this is what the father says there was a couple things they never considered when they plotted this whole thing together with the intel you know with the wicked rich with the fake news media i mean there's so many that are going to be probably be either put in prison lose what they have built up lose their fortunes because they will have been busted you're going to lose they'll lose all the way around there's no way they will ever win anything or have anything this is from the father himself he said number one they're trying to do this in a country that already is free they're not going to a third world country that isn't free they're trying to take things away from americans they're different they were born free they live free they make up their own mind they want a future he said there'll never be civil war that's what they were hoping for that we would be killing each other he said but americans true americans the red-blooded americans have a hope for a dream and a future they have a family they want a life and they want to live and they are not willing to give it up they didn't vote for evil they didn't choose evil he said an evil is not in power right now he will remind you of a scripture and the righteous are in power that people rejoice is that what it says well trump isn't power the other side is not they're illegitimate they stole the election he knows that almost 80 million people know that it was stolen because everybody knows who they voted for amen so this is an epic time in our country to show when truth prevails and the people prevail this country belongs to god and we the people amen the other thing they will never consider [Applause] and god says all the time i'm in your papers i'm on your money i'm written in your in your constitution you said i'm everywhere because i was allowed to be in this country he said when you look at the two differences between the illegitimate ones and the actual president i am welcome in this country by trump he even made that statement many times he recognizes who god is he invites god to be here he he loves christians he loves their faith he loves the the churches he loves and he wants us to have freedom and according to our constitution we have every right to have church to come together to meet is that correct so when the other side wants to wipe it out disallow it abolish it and crush it that should show you right there they're lost they have already lost what they want to plot and plan i'm not willing for that to happen amen and with all the prayers that have come forth on behalf of this country you need to know that when you pray they fill these bowls before the altar of god your prayers your worship fill these huge bowls and when they're full god tips them when they're tipped a whole new move of god comes to this earth so what is about to happen isn't crash and burn to be destroyed is about to be wiped clean of the evil and a powerful move of god is about to hit this country [Applause] and this is what the one who made everything is saying amen his words count above the others right amen but jesus christ wants is he not is not the earth his and the bones thereof the earth is who the lord and the fullness thereof then if it is his and he's already got this time planned who do you think is going to win jesus it doesn't matter how bad it looks or sounds and i would encourage everybody to stop watching the fake news because they plotted and planned to brainwash people all along they understand how that works and they have done that to many people i have family members i have friends that listen to it and all they know is this they hate trump they can't even tell you why they hate it they just know they hate him right and so they're brainwashed into thinking he's so bad they gotta vote for the other side they don't even know what the other side stands for i know i met somebody the other day before i came oh i like who's in there now i said you like evil you want terrorists to come into our country without any boundaries you want human trafficking and drugs to keep rushing into our country without anyone stopping them you want law and order taken away so people can come and burn your place or take whatever they want to from you and they're looking at me really strange well that's not what's going to happen i said they've already signed papers are you not listening to what they're saying oh no i just know they're good and trump is bad and that's what some people think they don't have a clue because they were taught for all those years continually when the same thing is put into you over and over again in your soul and you don't stop it or you don't lose it from there it builds in you as a man thinketh in his heart that's your soul so is he that means what you let in is what you will become your heart he talks about the bible all the time isn't this human beating heart it's the core the word heart means the core of something the center of something the core of your being is your soul you are a soul that's what god said when he made adam he became a living soul that is very key the other thing the body of christ needs to learn is what does that mean why is my soul so important why do you think he says to guard it you decide what goes in there you decide what you watch what you hear and what you say and all three of those things will affect who you are that's what will come out of you what you allow in there if you don't like you maybe you should change what you're saying or what you're watching because it will influence your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choose and your emotions how you respond to all that what do you act out in your life what do you actually say about you are you manifesting from christ his character his purposes his words clearly written because that's what he wants from us the world should look at us and see christ when they hear us they should hear christ is that right does christian mean christ's life then we need to start acting like that because when you do you terrify the devil if he can't crush you and put fear in you which has always been his greatest weapon his second greatest weapon is deception he's been working overtime with deception deceiving people taking up parts of the word making whole bibles that left hope books of the bible out or twist what they say i tell people make sure if you read the word of god it's got the whole counsel of god there's some that take out the the millennial reign of christ they even take out the tribulation some of them even say it's okay to sin and there's some people never heard any of this before but it's true because the enemy is doing whatever he can to deceive us amen and obviously some people have been deceived by believing a lie so i don't work for hell i don't represent hell i have nothing to do with hell there's no darkness in me i do not tolerate any acts or words or thoughts of the enemy yes yes i serve the most high god and him alone will i serve it's okay with me if people don't like my pink hair they will be taken to the welcome center when they get to heaven because you see people with every color of hair in heaven that's where the rainbow lives and the one who carried you you lived in that rainbow before you came here you had a little spirit of life that was your little spirit person lived in the father that's why we are his offspring you wrote on the rays of the rainbow in and out of him you played in the river of life inside of him you jumped on the stones of fire that burn with passion for you and online and that river of life goes over those those gemstones massive gemstone filled with a fire it shoots that rainbow out of him you lived there so he made a plan with the words on how to bring redemption how to bring mankind back to him in heaven some of the angels still call jesus christ the word you all know what the bible says the word was with god and was god and there was nothing that was made that was not made by him he had flesh put on him he agreed to come and die and that put on that cross and carry to that cross every sin wicked evil act word intentions he drank it in the cup in the garden even when he didn't want to did he give up his will did he say to the father not my will but your will be done and he drank all that evil he died in the garden when he surrendered himself because it wasn't just his body that had to hang on that cross every evil act and sin had to be put on that cross and someone who was perfect and holy had to carry that to the cross he was guiltless he was innocent no sin in his life even when he walked on this earth and yet he was willing to take that in him that is why he is the only one who can forgive your sins because he took those sins to the cross there's no other being that can do that for you there's no other religion out there that can say that you can get into heaven he is your way back to the father and part of his reward was when you die and moved to heaven you're not lost you didn't lose somebody they moved jesus christ is to walk you up the steps of the throne and say hear father i have brought your son or your daughter back to you that is why heaven rejoices and throws the biggest party ever every time someone comes home because jesus is going to get to do that that's part of his reward he loves to call you to get undone and when you step out of whatever you came in whether it's one of heaven's elevators whether it's a starship or it's christ's chariot there's many ways he can take you up to heaven when you get out you'll step into the river of life right there coming out of the city and he will start throwing water on you and you will have a water fight that's what you will have and you're going to see people dancing and singing all over even outside the gates they'll be celebrating there's music everywhere the flowers sing the trees seeing the ground is alive the sky is alive and you're stepping into life and some people like i thought we couldn't play music i thought it was going to be silent in heaven that was only one dime it was only one time it was silent in heaven that was it not since then you look for someone to be quiet you'll find a place and then the trees will start talking to you or the rocks or the creatures there's life everywhere so they have actually got a welcome center i'm not making it up you're going to laugh even harder when you see the humor of god this whole family i knew growing up in our city that owned all the funeral homes were strong believers they had compassion and kindness for people and one of the heads of all that was about ready to go home to heaven and god had me take this paper scroll paper and write in gold ink his word for that man that was ready for me to get a word for a person i usually prophesied corporately and i took it to the funeral home he was even in his 90s he was still there greeting people's families he had known for a long time and he's about to go inside and i said richard could i give you something and he said well what do you have i said i have a word from god for you and he started to cry on the sidewalk he said all my years of living and caring and loving no one has ever given me a word from god [Music] i said well he's gonna tell you your future in heaven gonna tell you what you're gonna be doing and god wrote all these beautiful words about him about he had been given a heart to care and great compassion and understanding to help people go through a time in their life and god said you always got them when they were going to heaven but now you will get them when they're coming to heaven because i'm putting you and all your family in charge of the welcome center and this is the hillary said you may tell everybody that you now your family now gets them going and coming and he was so undone and i said god would not let me just speak that word to you he has this scroll prepared as if he had handwritten himself it was this beautiful paper parchment paper i said this is your word and when you go home in a couple of weeks she said you'll be going in a couple of weeks you can let your brother know who's remaining what his future will be i said when he said that to me right yeah he took me up to heaven i saw your brothers they all look alike i saw your brothers i saw your father in this beautiful building and i saw people when they would get out of these transports and they're like this [Laughter] and they would walk in and say come on we're going to make it all okay yes you're in heaven i know it's more than you ever dreamed just come with us and we're going to explain and they had such compassion and kindness for the people and i love to tell that story because it shows you the humor of god but the reward of god he doesn't forget the kind acts that you do so i actually can say and you can say you know who's running the welcome center it is the heritage family from the hardest people and and i went to visit him once when he was in the hospice and i took him a picture of the portal in heaven i've been taken to where people look down and see their families and they can declare over them they go every year to sing happy birthday to you from from heaven and it's a beautiful place i was taken to they have them all over heaven and i i put that right beside where he was lying so he could look at it and he said i will never forget your act of kindness that you gave me god's word when i needed it the most and he said i am so looking forward to running the welcome center [Applause] and about a week after i went by there i was driving down the road and i knew where that where he was and that beat this beautiful hospice place and i actually saw him leaving with angels being taken up to heaven and god said look to the right and he said richard's leaving because i was obedient he allowed me to see him leaping and so i was very blessed so i started calling people richard richard heart just went to heaven before anyone else knew he went to heaven i just saw him he's leaving forever people are used to that for me and then they said then they had a head on the news because he was well known all the city uh we we we mourn the passing of richard harter to this day such that and i want thank you god for letting me see that so they celebrate from the time they step out of that old body this body is part of you it's what sleeps but you your spirit man never sleeps even when you're sleeping now your soul never sleeps that's a spiritual part of you your soul is awake you play music christian music at night you're feeding your soul if you play the word of god at night somewhere that's feeding your soul even things that like learning or mentoring tapes you're feeding your spirit man that's going in your soul what you hear goes in your soul and it can begin to change you some people i can't sleep in music i have it going 24 hours a day in my place in more than one room i want to saturate my walls i can walk in my home even if it's not on and i hear the music that plays all the time that remains in the room your words remain in your rooms where you live sometimes i walk in someone's home and hear things i don't like i'll step outside and i'll pray over them and break the enemy off at their home images remain in your home by stuff you watch we need a great understanding of our soul your soul doesn't sleep okay you feed it 24 hours a day your body gets fed three times a day sometimes five times a day in america probably five times or more and now you're all eating cake so you can add that to your wrist so your body gets fed several times a day right your spirit man god said sometimes once a week i feed mine every day i make sure my spirit man gets back the word of god whether i listen to it whether i read it or i listen to powerful speakers online now we got the internet god designed the internet by the way not the devil it does not belong to the devil amen and these words of god coming literally some people will have angelic beans come out of their computers this is a portal this is a portal it is a portal your computer is a portal your ipad is a portal whatever can carry images or transmit stuff it can transmit heaven or the other place you need to be careful what you put on here amen i'll be somewhere and i'll see things up like i'll see things come right out of the tv i'm very careful i need to tissue somebody i'm very careful about what my eyes see okay i don't want to put stuff in my soul it doesn't belong there i'm going to keep it sorry i'm going to keep my soul pure i want it pure and it's not that hard it's a lifestyle being like christ should be a lifestyle it's not a sunday thing although i'm thankful people actually go on sunday of course some people can't even go on sunday now but i want you know california is breaking all the rules right now california has had it with the lockdowns that's right and i noticed he's been speaking about america and that's what i'm leading up to you have to remember what the father said okay the enemy is not in power right now in this country it is not god still is trump still is he is a president he is the one who's in power he is in office so when the righteous are in office or they're in power the people rejoice that's why he's telling everybody to eat cake amen the worst thing you can do to the enemy right now is to you celebrate like it's already happened you know what this scripture says call those things that be not as though they were that means you act like they've already happened so if you believe victory is coming and it is then you should act like it he sets a table a table is what you eat from it's what you celebrate from that's what he's saying he's saying that scripture even the myth of every one thing around you he can set a temple of celebration for your life and it missed everything around you and that will begin to combat darkness because the enemy sees he's not winning hallelujah our life gets brighter that he put in us when he got born again you got part of the light of god put in you some people's light would blind the enemy some of you can already see it when you begin to stand for what is right and you don't step back that life society begins to blind the enemy and he gets terrified and i ask the father what else can they do they prayed they fasted they laid on their face they've encouraged people and he said they can eat cake and celebrate [Applause] and every time he's called me up to heaven guess what they're doing they're eating cake because they've already seen the victory happen amen the father's been from the beginning to the end in the end of the beginning and then he'll let you know you were there too before he made this earth and he sent you from himself he had already been from the end of the beginning the beginning of the end he'd already been there you were in him when he went there and made things you were in him living in him you've already been yourself from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning because you're you're eternal beings we are eternal amen you're born again one day you'll be immortal immortal means you can't sin you can't get sick you can't die that's your future some of those behind that barbed wire will not have that future amen so these are great days that we're living in but the father chose to explain things to you so it's perfectly clear to you like it is to him our country has a great future because it will impact this world we will be we'll we will be changers atmosphere changers amen we walk into place because of christ in us the atmosphere will change smith wigglesworth used to walk into places and people would fall on their face begin to cry out to god that was a measure the measure he's given us now is beyond that original measure you drive past people's homes and they'll in your homes fall out under the glory people will see your roofs on fire because the fire of god in you in your home people will walk in and out of the walls to go speak someplace one day i won't come by plane i'll walk through the wall and come right out on the platform these are greater days of glory that we're entering into and he has to expose the evil and it has to be dealt with it can't be taken off the earth at this time but it will be crushed back and we will rule with great authority and dominion we were given it by christ jesus he never let anything stop him in this earth not even time he was over time he would step in the spirit realm and walk through the people he didn't walk around the people i've been to the amount of the precipice i've been there i was in israel last year on the tour that they bushwhacked me with because no one told me i'd have to be on the bus at 8 am [Laughter] when i laid down at 7 am and no one told me as the speaker of this tour to 18 places in israel i climbed the mountains i went down inside of mountains i've been to every significant place in israel the dimensions in the bible and i thought i was going to have a nice place to speak in the hotel and i do a couple meetings a day and i have to go here my husband was laughing the whole time and i tell them steve showed someone you bushwhacked me they hooked a microphone on me and recorded everything he said wherever god says the prophets i do it well he had something to say everywhere i went where the fire came down before elijah i got to speak on the sea of galilee they had a fox so thick the boat couldn't leave so i commanded the fog to lift and it was gone in three minutes i don't tolerate the weather being over me it wasn't over christ was it right he was not afraid of anything in the enemy the enemy would run from him the demons would scream when he would be around them and he walked as a righteous man on this earth he chose he had to choose with his will he had to live just like us he was still the son of god but he's also called the son of man he's appointed with every single thing that we're tempted with or attacked with and yet he was victorious in every way in his life why because he was setting an example for us you can live that way i live that way it's different but it's fun it's fun to walk holy because you choose to be holy people say you can't be holy i said the bible says we can it says he's coming for a church this is one of the reasons why he's not coming right now should be pretty evident the world will know us by our love for each other i challenge you to go talk to some worldly people and ask them if you think the church loves one another it says in the bible they will know us by our love for each other so guess what he's not coming right now roll up your rapture rug and stick in the closet it clearly says the wealth of the wicked and they sure have a lot that's been pretty evident for everybody the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just and the righteous that has not been transferred yet are you willing to leave without that it says even by christ himself the works i did you will do how many people do you know are walking on water raising the dead that stinks they're in the grave so long making food appear everywhere wherever they need it to appear stepping in a boat and transporting it in time itself stepping in the spirit room and walking through places we need to already be doing that because those greater works are coming rapidly when you will raise the dead of the funeral that was cremated where you will stop an earthquake that started until it to put it back the way it was before it came where you tell the weather what it can and cannot do we have to be ready for those things because he's not holding them back once he does this what he is going to do is setting the platform for us he's not doing it just to bless the world it is for the body of christ to step up and be who we were called to be you were born here because he wants you here you're an american you're here to represent god himself that's why he made america he calls it his gift his first gift was his son his second gift to the world was america where people walk in righteousness and they have liberty and freedom and justice in their country where they honor and respect him and they're not ashamed of who he is the moral majority in this country did vote on november 3rd and they chose justice liberty and freedom we didn't choose the other stuff that the devil tried slipping in their lives are not going to be good because they chose what was wrong and they feed upon people and they destroy people they want to crush our country they want to make it into a third world country they don't care about anybody's color of their skin they care about nothing but evil and wickedness hurting and harming they will use anything they can to make their point and they will lie every time they do it so god is not tolerating what they have said will happen it will not happen and it will not remain and it will not be forever it will not be very long down the road before what he showed me will happen he showed me when that freedom is announced he showed me when they will be forced to announce the election was [Applause] [Music] stolen for these four years he needs to continue what he has started god gave him to start in this country i think he's going to be a little bit more tempered having had to see all the evil but i promise you he despises evil and when god first showed me trump he said he is an all-american boy who is all for america that's how god himself described him and he has lived that before all of us even with a hate never and our history our country has a president been so wrongly accused and hated and just people feed on that i mean they feed evil feeds on that and then when others came in to join them and decided to collude with them that means it became a part of what they were planning to block everything we said that was truth they wouldn't allow they don't want people to know the truth they think if they can keep the truth from being heard that what they want will happen but they're wrong about that too some networks will be lost they won't exist anymore because of the lies they conspired to overthrow this country anyone who committed conspiracy to overthrow the presidency or the overseer of the country are going to prison amen please don't hear about already overseas they're making arrests for those who from other countries leaders of other countries people in high places in other countries have already been arrested and i think they're going to get as many from there as they can and then they're going to it's going to happen here you will see you will see justice justice will be served amen [Applause] to miss your destiny nor your future amen it's just going to get greater and greater in the days to come these are not the days of great darkness there will not be cities burning other than the ones they burned their south and all those cities that have been burned people were paid to do that they were all hired even the people for black lives matter antifa they have paid for all of that to be done not to help anyone they're using them they even make promises to china for things and now people are wanting to collect on the promises so now some of them behind the barbed wire are hiding because they can't deliver what they thought what they would already have in their hand by now they thought we'll have civil war half the people will be dead we'll just go in and collect everything and take over [Music] we're not gonna have civil war we don't want civil war we have freedom we have our lives we love our families so they're never going to get us to do that amen and this is from the father they will never get your guns there's far too many red lakes in america he even shocks me sometimes with some of the things that he says but i have to agree because i know some of those run nets he said they'll never reach them they'll be dead before they can get to them one of the reasons why they haven't done anything is we can still get them because we have our arms it's written in our papers we have the right to bear arms is that correct we have many freedoms and liberties given to us in our constitution they're trying to twist everything they can it's still not gonna work and until god i'm glad you're gonna do something quicker than later because the rednecks i'm gonna wait much longer my brother has a hotline to him you haven't heard about my brother you go back and look at some of those videos you hear about him he is all for justice he has to make out himself he has a hotline from homeland security and some other groups that are organized should they need their help their guns are ready and trump said there's a reason why i said go home and go home and stay safe you know i will be back he's trying to keep us you know not not get upset or not have fear come in us and the other thing god promised was he will take the virus off the face of the earth [Applause] [Music] devious purposes to bring heart to you the social distancing was to keep us apart so we wouldn't come together although the bible is very clear don't forsake the gathering together of yourselves and so he's against social distancing in case you wonder he doesn't like it there's no social distancing in heaven and there's no mask in heaven there's not even handshakes choose only hugs and i keep telling people we're gonna have a mass burning party one day i am not ignorant to the fact that there are some people who have compromised lives already you know they have issues if they want to wear them let them wear them i'm not against them wearing them i'm against me being forced to wear one when i don't need what i [Music] and i don't like it every time they say the new normal they can have them in normal but it's not going to be in this country safer to apart no we're not safer apart right that's never been true we're safer together amen we're here together we're in this together and we have a god who has a plan he says he hasn't gone on dates everyone else pip so they've jumped off the wagon they're wagging a victory in celebration they just think we're just going to give it and i'm not rolling over to anybody no i'm not giving that up i know god has a plan and hang in there you're going to be really happy that you were some of the ones who said all along victory is coming and everyone will have to eat their words but they'll still be happy that we're free amen so you remember jesus who we belong to and gave ourselves to hold your life in his hand no man holds your life in their hand he wants us all to be free even the bible said god never intended for a person to be over us he wasn't all for the kings at all he didn't appoint kings man wanted a king to be maybe you didn't know that back in the old days they demanded to have a king be over them and so from that point on there's always been leaders presidents kings those in authority over people that's why he said when the righteous are in power the people rejoice because they have a good one when the wicked is they're not going to rejoice amen we are rejoicing amen hallelujah so i won't talk but a few minutes more because you know i'm you know when i'm finally awake which i'm kind of awake you don't know but i'm actually sleeping it's hard to get up in the morning for me that's my that's my night time and i tell people it's not the next day until i go to sleep and i wake up then it's the next day my family has mostly adapted to the way uh my hours are i like that since i was little my husband used to go to sleep at ten o'clock no matter what was going on he can hang in there until midnight at least sometimes one in the morning my mom will hang in there to two or three in the morning with me she's gonna be 90 next year and she said if she had her way she'd be taking a plum switch up to that barbed wire and be making some changes herself [Laughter] she's still my mom and i'm blessed that she lives with me but she definitely has her own opinions about things and she's not happy with it either but she also understands and she does pray for people people who are seniors in certain situations in their life she prays all the time for them she actually has an anointing for people for married couples that can't have children she's highly anointed if she prays for you i have a baby in nine months it has happened over and over and over usually when she comes to me she has her own prayer line so she's brought many babies from heaven to earth by praying for people releasing her anointing to to bring them from heaven to earth for god she still does that she still prays for people and it works her faith is there she operates i operate you know in the revelation zone she operates in the baby zone so i i love what i do i love people i can honestly say i love you i love you with the father's love and he does have great plans for us and i wish everyone could hear these words he cares he doesn't like sickness and disease he doesn't like anger he doesn't like violence he doesn't like life being taken from us that's nothing he purposed for us and so if people don't know jesus christ i will encourage anybody watching right now that you make sure you receive jesus christ as your savior it gives you more than just hell insurance okay it gives you authority dominion it helps you to step into the supernatural and in these days of greater glory we'll see things never seen before on the earth with the signs and wonders that will be done people will be shocked and stunned to see really the power of god in us because of his son so i look forward to seeing you all again and i i pray that you have a blessed day oh i'm absolutely going to be speaking at the inaugural prayer breakfast okay i got to pray for him back in 2000 when they had the last prayer breakfast i actually got to pray for him for the vice president for their families for the future of america and i'm telling you god and don't and you reserve your judgment for pence okay don't judge people when you don't know everything you don't understand covert activities you don't know what's going on so reserve your judgment for him okay they're very close they really care for each other i know people in their administration so don't jump on something because you see something or hear something you can't tell everything that's going on especially if it's covert it won't be covered amen so we will see what is decided about that what decisions are made i do know that god did pick pence for eight years also like he did the president and i need to let you know that means if trump won the election that means vice president pence also won that election amen so we'll see what god's going to do i do want you to get ready to celebrate in your life like you never have before eat cake in moderation and right now i had already asked them if i could teach you a dance [Applause] if i if i could teach this dance to you i'm kind of fine if i actually have now i do have music can you all play everybody dance now can you dance now i'm teaching them you might have to play that one from your phone dancing [Applause] [Music] everybody i'm trying to stop it first because i have to teach it to you first because we can play it up here through this pa system my husband's brother now we're going to okay this first if you go why do you do this because it's heaven culture okay uh church is supposed to be fun amen it is god in heaven but when i started speaking not only did i have to show up with my pink hair which freaked out a lot of pastors i don't know why i thought you know and i even knew like 40 some pastors in mine was sitting they said you've gone too far you fell off the edge so now we can't work with you it's just while some people will look and go know that you don't qualify anymore well you know the holy spirit already warned me and he i actually saw angels doing this dance that we're going to learn in my own church we had a prophet several prophets coming at a panel they did a q a session and all their angels were standing behind them on the platform because i see the angels see all of yours by the way they're excited because they you're going to do this famous they're going to be doing this dance with you okay and so i saw them doing this dance and i'm like well that's wow that looks like fun what was that the holy spirit said they're doing the revelation dance because the people have received revelation this day and they're excited and then i went to canada about two weeks later and i was speaking with people there we had four hour meetings they would break for lunch and we'd come back i said boy they did it and and in the second meeting the hospital said you're going to teach them all that dance what dance the humor in all this is all three of my daughters their gift is dance they do ballet do all the traditional beautiful stuff they're anointed people been raised from the dead when they dance they've been healed when they dance it is who they are and i don't dance at all i've been kicked out of jazzercise classes okay and now he's telling me all my daughters laugh hysterically every time i talk about it you have to teach them you're teaching everyone in there this dance because we want them to celebrate they're going to learn to celebrate when they receive revelation they need to celebrate and so i did and i think the only song i at that time knew about was when the saints come marching in so i talked to him and so when i get back to where i live um i heard this music and the holy spirit said that's the music we want you to learn to teach it to them and that's that's that's a secular song he said yes but we like that song we want everyone to tell us they're going to dance when they get to heaven they may as well practice now and so ever since then i have taught this dance to that song and does anybody here know that dance anyone i know you do you really come up here if anyone has done the students before you can come up here a couple of you come up here everything on camera is going to be doing this dance too they will jump in and do it a lot of them already know it it's actually caught the revelation names but for some reason because i talked to my angels everybody calls it if you google angel dance it will bring up congregations all over the world doing this dance and so it's it has three movements that's all i'll tell you what they each mean and then i'll show you with you the first one is that um i'm receiving revelation it's treasure so i'm digging up treasure that's that's the first movement the second one is i'm celebrating the revelation the third one is i'm gonna share it everywhere [Applause] and i didn't know anything about counts or beats or nothing okay i can't even play a tina marine i was going off the stage that is not my gift i can't even keep me to that and so someone uh the holy spirit said you gotta do to account eight and i'm like i was coming and then this angel appears again when i wake up in the morning which is noon this angel appears to me in my room and he goes watch i don't know if he was happy with the assignment or not he said watch this and he did the whole thing and he was speaking he said wow we're digging up revelation that's like treasure you know he did it to the count of eight he said now we're celebrating the revelation and now we're gonna share it everywhere and he said he looked at me goes did you get that i said i got it he goes good you go oh my gosh so that's what we're going to do so we're going to practice so we're going to practice up here first okay are you ready uh you can play with me okay so we're going to practice it first you can watch his practices and you're all going to get a practice [Music] ready [Music] okay cut now it's your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] your turn are all getting ready to do this dance with you it's crazy so we're going to start when i say start we'll all start together the thing is when you turn around don't do like rapid okay because somebody's going to be halfway in this when you're already going all the way so you're kind of tired together so are you ready yeah okay here we go we're gonna practice go ahead and start the music [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's go [Music] [Applause] okay we're going to go three times all the way around and then we can all just go okay okay are you ready to start the music your kids can come up if you want to wait wait wait wait wait everybody [Applause] [Music] okay here we go again [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh i can tell you uh probably my hardest group to teach was a group of 80 baptist ministers [Applause] god doesn't cut any i was invited in canada they had a monthly prayer meeting unit for like 15 years right they'd have a guest speaker well they didn't tell anybody i was going to be there so when we got there margaret and i sat at this table we could see eyes piercing us right who's this woman with pink hair i'm like margaret i think they got tired feather feathering in their mind and this little guy gets up and they all knew him because there was a few catholics there there were a few presbyterians a few but mostly retired practice winners not even like new young ones and by the time i got up and i introduced myself and and the guy played his little accordion for worship that wasn't enough to burn my flesh all their angels were behind them laughing so hard they could hardly stand up and so i said i was here to share heaven they got to call me up in heaven and they were like this there was not one bit of emotion on their faces they were so angry at the the guy who was the head of the breakfast and i said i'm just going to press him and i started talking about what it was like to stand before the son of god and of course in their mind i could read it no one can stand see the face of god then die they would die i mean that's what was in their minds and then about five minutes in they started to cry i saw tears coming down their eyes and then across their arms and they sat there they were so undone by the love of god and explaining what it was like to see before him and the ways of consuming passion that came from him and how you well he welcomed you home to heaven as his son and daughter no one cared in that room that i was a woman nobody cared i had pink hair they began to shake visibly shake sitting in their seats because of the presence of the holy spirit they didn't even know they didn't know how to respond they didn't know what to do all they could do was shake and then when we got vienna said now i'm going to teach you something they do in heaven by that time they didn't care what i said i said so heaven does this dance angels do the same uh revelation about heaven and about the father and about his son they do this dance would you all like to learn this dance and they yelled at the top of their lungs yes and we had our little computer with us and we were going to plug it in to get the music that music and i said when we do it to this music you may not understand but we have to do everybody dance now because you know they don't dance in church they don't raise hands in church and i'll tell you before we were done they were dancing raising their hands and we couldn't get our music converted so the little guy said well i can play you know uh when the saints come marching in on my little thing got up and learned that dance and they were laughing and they were crying in her hands okay in the beginning when he did his little recording thing he was saying it's okay to raise your hand god won't strike you down and none of them raised their hand they were all like they were doing the whole thing the best part was they were going to have a second meeting and they called all their friends you have to come this person didn't say lady this person has been the handwritten talked about the throne of god there was twice as many pastors in that room it was like there were 200 glasses in that room and the animals couldn't wait until i said now we're going to learn a dance it was life changing life changing for all of them so if they can do it you can do it amen and we did that all over america wherever i traveled in the world everybody learned that dance and we know some pastors that had it taken on purpose and they welcome people to the church then they play the dance on the screen and everybody gets up they either want to stay or they want to leave but heaven is like that they celebrate all the time you know and people love their life there they can't wait for you to get there they make plans for you they get these little things to actually record places that they go that they can keep that they know you will love specifically to go and see in heaven so you're going to be really busy when you get there amen so the other thing i want to do is lay hands on every person here amen and i'm going to give out importations to everybody amen if you want it i promise you that i'm healthy and whole but you know it says that that you get implications by the laying on of hands is that right so i'm not going to mock laying my hand on you i'm actually going to put my hand on you right here i'm going to release the love of god so the way i usually do this is we get a line going and you walk i'll like i'll stand here and that line will form all the way around and you come up to me and i'm just going to say come here honey are you just come up here and i'll go i i impart the love of god into you and it will go from here because i operate in it it'll go here into your heart okay and you'll begin to feel his presence in you so and remember whatever it is you need from him because this is from him you can ask for if you need healing if you need finances if you need you know things in your mind restored whatever it is you can ask me for it at that moment okay so oh and make sure you say i receive it okay everybody practice i receive it and that's you saying yes that you do accept that so remember you have not because you asked not so by coming being willing to come up here you're saying you're going to have it amen so we need to get that line somebody needs to get that line going maybe i think we usually start where we start from the back or the front i don't remember yeah so i think the last the last row come around here and just get in line right here and as you receive it just go back and sit down this doesn't take very long because i'm not going to go to every person and take hours to do that okay this is an accelerate accelerated way to receive we're entering into accelerated days so it won't take very long to do that all right that's what i was thinking

[Applause] if you see me making hand motions i'm copying the angels in the room they never are stagnant they're always moving they're always moving and so they really loved anything that worships the lord every time they go wild leaving in the throne room when when you're worshiping or adoring jesus christ just for a while but a lot of them they were going like this well most of them were going like this except the ones behind her one behind her was going so i have to call you when i'm watching it's hard not to do it the throne room is a powerful powerful place it is so amazing to have been there and the seraphim when the seraphim starts singing they come out of the glory cloud over the throne and their hair is on fire it's like blue fire and they sing and they sing and they sing and they sing i keep inviting them to come so if they ever showed them though your hair probably turned blue and catch on fire there's some of the fire carriers in the throne room but to be there on purpose there's nothing like no one is up there crying that they died as hard as that might seem to you to imagine they're not no one's crying no one is sad no one is grieving no one remembers anything bad that rhyme that wasn't me his holy spirit they they don't they're so in the glory really and that thing about for all of sin that comes short of the glory of god it's not about you committing sins i hear that you know if they don't have revelation they don't understand what that means that means you you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying it for him releasing it for him it comes out of you like shockwaves begin to permeate everything it touches every person every place we we we don't do that we don't know how to do that it's something we'll do now in this time you are in one of the most important times on the face of the earth one of the most blessed times regardless of what your i see your ears here no you were chosen from the beginning of time to be here you were meant to be here all of your family members are so excited you're here amen you're not looking at the mass you're not looking at the virus which is you know pretty much gonna be taken off the face of the earth by god it's being used against everybody it really is i'm not saying it's not there i'm not saying it hasn't touched some people but it's nothing like what they're saying it is you need to know the truth i bring the truth i have to speak the truth okay all of this that you're living in now will be like dust in a very short time acceleration in this world and not just america this whole thing is yes it's here we know it's here uh we we talk about it we share what do we do but let me tell you it's worldwide what god is going to do he he is planning and his plan will take place it will say it will say god's will god's way not man's way not the enemy's way it will be god's way this country will be known by the glory of god the presence of god and he's setting it up you yes to understand there's covert operations in heaven and there's covert operations on earth and maybe you don't know all that but yes things are happening you cannot see but you will see them suddenly say suddenly it will all be known say everything will be known all the stuff about the elections will be known [Applause] and we will celebrate [Applause] and i know wonderful people talk about revivals a lot of people talk about moves of god a revival is kind of i don't want to say stagnant but it's kind of centralized in certain places what's coming isn't going to be centralized moves of god will come together to create one thing and that is called a habitation say habitation is what is coming it can't be controlled it can't be stopped and it can't be changed it's coming from heaven and we will be the habitation no one can move us or take us from the place god puts us so no matter how people are putting it what really is coming is a habitation of god yes that has never happened before on the face of the earth and you will not just get delivered you'll get to share it you get to experience it you get to carry it say carry it say the knowledge of the glory will happen because we will carry that glory all over this world so don't think of yourself of being left out okay that's not possible say if i'm alive and breathing i'm part of it that's how it's gonna be this time amen amen say for generations step out of your box and just say it for generations until god is done the boy will grow and build and cover the whole earth like the waters cover the sea the world will know there is a god and they better decide amen the other thing that i know is truth we can all say this together nothing that was done through cheating stealing lying unjust accusations will not escape being brought to justice [Applause] and let me tell you the god side knows a whole lot that's been going on that maybe you don't know and i am talking about trump that's okay if you're not okay come outside we'll get you saved and you know the person who likes him the least is the devil truly the one who's most terrified of him of trump is the devil say the devil doesn't like him maybe i should one of the few presidents who has said to the people i'm here to give your country back to you and i'm here to welcome jesus back into the white house he wasn't always perfect everyone knows that especially the fake news but they're stuck on it they all they do is hit replay and i've traveled all over the world when all that stuff started people were what's wrong with your news i want nothing not my news and not my news by the way you'd be better off not listening to anybody okay they know that they can brainwash you they know that they can compromise your soul to believe exactly what they're saying and that's why they keep saying it if you've never heard things about people that have gotten brainwashed that's how they do it they get you in a place so you will believe what they're saying then they'll say it over and over and over and guess what's going to come out of your soul say as a man thinketh in his heart that's his soul so is he that's what's happened to all of them their souls have been compromised they know it okay the darkness knows it all the others who are part of all that mess they all know that and that's why they keep it going that's why they don't want the truth to be known that's why they don't want us saying anything that's why they block you or be in you whatever they're doing they're so terrified that people will hear the truth and begin to believe it they don't want them i know i know i have i have really close friends who just did that they fed on it they're not the same people they're not the same people that's why every now and then anyway free soul checkup and i offer help to all those out there who have been compromised lose it from your soul and i'm really serious about that he made us that we can loose things remember the keys of the kingdom what you loose on earth will be loose from heaven what you bind on earth can be bound on him loose all the bad all the negative all the hurt trauma tragedies all of the fear all the fake news every word you've ever heard lose it all from your soul heaven will come down and pull it out and they really do that they will do that i've seen people change in three minutes from doing that then then you bind the things of god i choose my will to find the life of god the love of god the presence of god his will his way his word i find the truth to my soul and there is no one on the earth that can take it out of you that's what they need to heal the world actually needs a soul checkup right so it's not that hard to be free it's not number one you have to know that you're not you need to know when you've been deceived because the devil for eons and ages always use fear as his number one weapon now it's deception it really is because when you say yes to deception you're deceived and when you're deceived you can't see the truth understand the truth or even want to know the truth so this whole country and other people all over the world i always do those soul checkups if you hear me doing it that's why i'm doing it i want them to be free right that's right and after the first election i offered it free to all the democrats a post-election therapy i called it to have your soul set free and a lot of people did it and i have that a lot of people call me contact let me play says hey i did that i'm free we will get some new networks i promise you the truth is some of them will close and be shut down we'll keep on with the truth okay from the justice that's coming some of them will lose their network and you don't even know this but some ceos have already started stepping down the thing about deception is when you aren't deceived and you willingly knowingly do what's wrong and you know commit crime you're quite aware that it just might not work yeah so this whole thing that they're doing when they see isn't working they just put more barbed wire around them he's not god they can't stop god i'm not going to stop god so i also knew this that when these things the landslide starts can't stop it that's called justice amen a lot of them will try to run some may end their life we need to pray for those people because they don't want they don't want what that word was saying up there about the shame they didn't want people to know what they were doing but everyone's going to know what everybody was doing because it's already been collected amen and so they they have proof all the proof they need and i will just mention this for those who don't know this is a truth meeting how about that this is the truth the truth is that they've already been uh tried in a different kind of a court and been found um guilty and uh in case you didn't know uh trump is actually a president i just say that he did win he wants anyone they tried to steal it it's not going to work [Music] and the crazy thing in all this is they're trying they when i say they i mean the left delivers whatever you want to call them they god calls me villains i'll just say what he does the villains we're hoping we would just give up and do what they wanted they forgot one thing we we the people do not a third world country where we are in control say we are free and we're staying free man that made a big mistake and one thing he didn't consider that we wouldn't don't all dumb goblin has happened no they're not smart because we run closer to him we get closer to him we hear him clear we become more dangerous against hell that's what happens when you press on god's people that's exactly what happened so mistake number one was that you thought everybody would just dump god and give him up they don't know us say they don't know us they're about to find out amen [Music] so that was their first mistake the second mistake is we're already free we live free say we're free right now we aren't bound get anything to villains has written down his new laws and i have to say this to you because the father said this to him he said tell them this please it says when the righteous are in power the people rejoice so why don't you rejoice because the truth is the humans have no power they are not in power say the villains are not in power the righteous are in power so we're going to keep rejoicing while they remove the others the best show on earth jesus christ wiping out hell these are going to be glorious days and i am so excited to be here okay i got born again i i came out born again i think i do remember at age four receiving christ and because i'm a senior i saw him step inside of me you can't tell a child is four years old that he's not real and that doesn't really happen you're really more open to it than most people when they get older it's a little bit harder because your mind gets in the way i saw him step inside of me i liked it so much when i turned five for my birthday i did it all over again this is how precious jesus he stepped out to step back in [Music] for a birthday present so living life with heaven all the time is definitely different i tell people all the time i'm i'm like an eight-year-old if you pick on me you're picking on nate road they forget it really soon right they see a pretty flower a crawling bug or a piece of cake and they forget it so he really did i i worked with ceos most of the time i was i love business i'm a business person actually i'm a ceo hey this is how we dress when you get in here and having your ceo right they're the best apparel ever you don't get a nightgown in the bathrobe and having people i hope you didn't not for the one who owns everything he's not going to give you that that's not what people wear up there you have an apparel wardrobe room it's like a thousand square feet maybe more than that and every kind of beautiful amazing thing because there's so many things to do in heaven you can't ride a roller coaster in a gown in case you wonder i wouldn't try it for so long i grew up in the church trust me from the day i was born i was in church and i was there for every revival every special visitor it didn't matter if it lasted six weeks i was there every night for six weeks along with all my siblings and my parents would space the older ones in between the younger ones you know when you got 15 i mean several people i was i was an adult at age eight that's why he kept me video see i earned it because from that age i had to help take care of my 12 of my siblings everyone was a chief okay they were all in charge all highly anointed uh you know they they needed to be tempered a whole lot they practiced on me and from a very young age i could see in the spirit room i understood it being the father son holy spirit i remember when i invited the holy spirit he came inside me like a whirlwind and he's been there ever since and i can tell you how that happens who wants to know how he can be everywhere at the same time anybody want to know he has unlimited layers of himself one of the key words in heaven is layers there's layers of everything layers of space you can have like 10 places on your space your one mansion's on and it's hard to explain except when they teach me how to say it you can see it and so on your mansion let's say you have a city i've seen some people's mansions the size of new york city so maybe you better expand your thinking say expand that and on your management property there are these doors suspended just above the ground a beautiful door different colors different doors like around your or your whole property where your actual mansion is sitting on whether it's in the middle of the crystal sea under the crystal sea on top of the mountain spices in the valley of the falls uh wherever it is that he puts it uh on that property will be doors and if if you open the door you can see the other space that yours with places in there that are yours you can walk around the door like i could walk around this this is how there's no limit to space in heaven here's the door let's pretend this is the door you can walk around the door you see the door right you see it you can walk around it's just this but if you open the door you step into another whole area that belongs to you that could be in the valley of the falls the mansion out here is maybe on the beach of the crystal sea or the mountain spices so you get many he said what do you say i go to repair a place for you in my father's house a world not a flat place in the sky are many mansions i go there to prepare a place for you so he's not going to tell you any more than that oh until you get there and then you find out really how magnificent and amazing he is there's so many things adventure excitement intensity a joy humor all of that is in heaven that's why we have it here say it was there first it trickled down to here they have mountains they have valleys they have oceans you can ride a 200 foot wave and not die when you crash off of your board because you haven't done enough times up there the waves can change direction while you're on them okay they can open up they can swing you back and forth is heaven it says eyes have not seen your ear heard or entered in the heart or mind of man but he has prepared for you except and unless is revealed by the spirit of god i stand on that scripture for every time they've taken me every time they've shown me i can stand on that because of that i can see i can know and i can't understand and that's my commission my commission is to reveal heaven to this earth that's why i go all the time non-stop they have not stopped since 1996 taking me i used to try to count gave that up pretty soon and guess what when does he do it whenever he wants to why i gave him permission you have my permission to do with me whatever you want if you ever said that you better watch out because these are the days of the glorious signs and wonders that manifested signs with through the daughters and sons of god on the earth those aren't other beings who are going to come here and have it yes you say it's us we're your sons and daughters we'll manifest and demonstrate [Applause] hearing things and uh seeing things you never saw before and don't worry when he tells you you're going to hear him how does he do that uh step up and do that step out go up to the front of the funeral and raise the dead that was cremated [Music] [Applause] that happened a few times maybe facebook won't block it that's probably going to be replaced also by the way yeah they'll just be replaced and you know they didn't really do all that until guess who started running for office because he's a threat he said you can't be bought talk about trump again i don't mind insane it can't be bought can't be controlled they can't make him afraid and he already knows the truth so they can't convince him to lie they can't even deceive him he knew all of them before this started happening because the wealthy and the rich are invited to everybody's inner circle whether the good or not they know he knew the corruption that's why he was willing to do it we don't know what they're lying out of their teeth i know what they're doing i know all the stuff they're involved in no hey yes i will run and they were afraid from the day he said that they tried everything we could of 17 people trying to get that spot on the republican ticket and god told me i will eliminate them one by one by one and they will be forced to put him there guess what happened they were forced to put him there amen i know even even through history there's always been people that nobody else would have picked but god and some of them were very colorful yeah but if anybody ever heard all the stuff that was said against him they would think he wasn't worth anything and yet right now he's very valuable to god if anybody likes it or not he will be leading all this stuff that's going to be happening and while we've been out here some people not maybe y'all people are afraid not knowing what their life is going to be like how's everything what about all these horrible things being made from the villains laugh that's what heaven is doing about it there probably was never anything on the papers just so you know that they didn't waste the time to do it they whatever they can get away with the food people they're doing this is to say this is truth we just can't be deceived amen and most of people i've talked to i start to start a conversation anywhere in the airport the grocery store i don't care where it is so what did you think about the elections see i used to say hey i voted for trump 90 of everyone i talked to by the way you voted for trump yeah they did and the ones that didn't don't even know what the other ones are doing up there right now i confronted one of those the other day in my own yard yeah my husband hired him to mow front yard and came to the back he should have never done that i was about there i was back there because we released a home from friends of ours who were pastors in new york so uh the guy was replacing the little fertilizer fertilizer see i can't even think that what are they called where's my husband where are they putting the ground those tubes to kill the bugs that come in to eat your house up terminator see my natural brain don't ask me a question heaven spirit round future past you know anything about god father son holy spirit the 12 you know what are they the 12 the 24 elders know i know all of them already oh the seven spirits of god aren't just his attributes those are seven spiritual beings in case you wonder oh yeah they are actually seven smooth the wednesdays so they're seven spiritual beings it's one of the images they use god sends them on special assignments i laugh when you hear cloak and dagger that's usually about you know murder mysteries but actually holy spirit wears a club all the time he loves to he wears one the seven spirits of god wear them that came from heaven that's not a hell thing hell stole too many things okay say house deals because they can't create something new and so anyway so i was back there with a guy replacing those termite tubes and i said the same thing hey so uh he's up say he's a millennial too i said so what did you think about the elections i think they were stolen yes they were still on the lousy themselves they're all villains i want you to say what god calls them and then comes around the corner the other guy so what do you think about the elections oh i think i am so glad they got someone in there the other one was such a rotten lousy guy oh you're talking about fighting right might as well say his name yeah now i'm talking about something so oh no no no no he is the good guy do you know what the other ones are doing do you even know what they're doing well i know they're doing good things for this country but you cannot watch one single thing that they said they're doing and you don't know that they want to let all the terrorists in the world here with no pulse bar did you know they want to break down the law so all those human trafficking people can come through and just gather more to take out and and you obviously don't know that they're going to wipe out church completely because they don't want god here and this guy guy had already said to me god bless you well that's who you believe then you don't need to know those people up there because god's not blessing now he's going to remove them oh i don't think that let's just end this really quick conversation i would tell you they have all the evidence if they had no no i'm not talking about civil civil evidence i'm talking about military tribunal evidence i'm talking videos i'm talking testimonies i'm talking things that have been taped that you would be so horrified to find out what they actually have been doing even before they started their what they knew who they connected to what they've been doing all around this world it's already there it's there and they have it these guys who are in there now faking who they think they are they will be wiped out and god will say exactly who our president is back there maybe not in that spot but he's going to play back he will still run this country he is president he doesn't have to be proven to be president he already has won he won the other guy over here going yes yay the termite guy and this guy was probably in his late 40s and this young guy knew more than he did he was he was very aware of what was going on you'd be surprised if you talked to how many people voted for the other guy don't know anything that they're doing because all they know is they hate the other one and that was their plan we will bring this i'm serious it's what they do in other countries they brainwash people to believe what they want to then they go do whatever they feel like that's how those people live that's how people live in venezuela and other countries they know what socialism and communism is and they don't want it this way they try to escape so they made a few announcements and the whole rest of their campaign on the left was how horrible he is and if you ask him why is he horrible well i don't know but he's just i can free you from that right now in your soul do you wanna then they run come over here i'll get rid of that of your soul you need to get that out of your shoulder you can live a normal life again and actually tomorrow's when i talk about america this is this commercial for tomorrow amen because heaven is celebrating everywhere right now they're celebrating because they do know what time it is on god's timeline and if people don't know this is i'm talking about pastors and i won't talk about pastors revenge as well okay evangelists kind of got it made because they're still going for the big harvest right now we're going to talk about the naked harvest we're going on with the big harvest that's what we're here for what no you should be a voice for truth no matter what else you do you should say the truth let people know where you stand with what god wants what god asks of us let life live let life live and don't take it amen and anyone who wants to take life you're already in a really hard spot but god if you voted for life to be taken from babies you are in trouble and i can honestly say that according to the word of god you're in trouble you are and one day you'll be falling on your face repenting when you find out the truth of what the other ones were doing continually amen so i gotta let go let's let go and set it back here somewhere up here because god is right now beginning to create that habitation and people need to know number one the world's not ending now i'm talking about heaven it's not over say it's not over i just the father says it's over not even jesus knows when it's over and i have new spheres not coming for a church that is fighting each other angry at each other despising each other spitting on each other shall i continue coming for a church and a bride who has no sin and no flesh showing up in flesh and fleshy fighting it is what the spiritual mind is life refreshing mind it is he said i offer you life and death what do you say to choose my life a lot of people miss that this time around because life is what you're going to get everybody's going to get life even the ones who didn't want it it's going to come it's not going to stop from coming and he knows his timing he has a timeline around his behind his own throne his throne is in the middle of the throne room it's not on the back wall and you'd always seen these paintings there's god on his throne and there's millions of people all over here who can't get to him he didn't ever do that it's in the middle when four sets of steps and people run up there all the time all the time if you make it to heaven you're going to get to see god okay you get to see father you get to see jesus i never understood these people that said there's levels you have to get you after you get up there no the bible doesn't say does that no no it says the pure in heart shall see god amen and that means it can be now once you get born again or when you go to heaven people need to get over that no one can see the face of god and live oh trust me everything within you that was wrong would die instantly if you saw him but the bible clearly says the pure heart shall see god right so guess what i see him i see him i see jesus christ i didn't see the invisible spirit of god i see the outline of his person usually fires going around him or whirlwinds of the rainbow or going around him but i see him he's big and he is called the drama king in heaven well he sure creates drama every time he touches the earth doesn't he they were not suspecting him back in the day when he fell and began to do things that people were spinning and jumping over furniture and they really were doing crazy wild things way back they didn't even know what they didn't really know what they had they just knew it felt good we should be well acquainted with it he is my best friend and he speaks to me all the time guess what he's always speaking always say always are you hearing him you're hearing but maybe we need to unclutter our soul the more stuff you get in the layers you are a later being holy spirit as unlimited layers thank you holy spirit for reminding me i was supposed to talk about that see i told you you don't smell the time holy spirit is very powerful being he's still with celebration and joy drama excitement that's him if there's enough roar in heaven holy spirit there then i get corrected doctrinally i thought he moved to the earth why don't you have a conversation with him i'll let you talk to him about that and see what he says to you okay he has unlimited layers of himself so when he involves you you don't get a little piece you get a hold of him he takes a layer of himself and throws it in you that's how that happens unlimited layers that's how he can be everywhere all the same time all over the world know everything see everything hear everything you can invade any places he's invited to somebody's not invited to he's the most exciting single beings the most excited being in existence right now right now i see jesus can't come back right now the father's up there delegating through governmental stuff all the stuff that's going on right now on earth but the holy spirit well he didn't move his operations here that doctrinal person was right he did jesus said when i leave i will send who the holy spirit the comforter the one who will walk alongside hey walk alongside yeah unless you invite him in if you ever wonder what spiritual protocol is even in heaven you must invite okay you must invite i'll prove it you invited jesus christ right yes say yes he did we can take care of that right now [Music] you must invite jesus christ to be your savior repent of your sins invite him to come in this is all scriptural john 3 16 he will come into you he also has unlimited layers and he made you with unlimited layers of you everyone in here has layers that look just like you is this exciting yeah it should be it's the way you meet your soul your soul your emotions are all your layers the more emotional we are the more layers of you you have in you what does it do with those layers well when you get born again because you invited him right he takes one and he seats it in heavenly places and it's you it literally is it literally really truthfully is you it's a part of you it looks just like you still connected to your soul so all around your will let's say this is your will it's a strong column off of that from all these layers that look just like you but they move like they're living because they are this is a spiritual part of you not talking about your flesh your flesh suit is your flesh seep okay until it gets super glued together at the end that's glorified when you're glorified that'll happen one day okay you don't get glorified in heaven you can glorify when your spirit person who moves to heaven while your body rests or if it's blown up or eaten by a shark or burnt up to nothing he knows where every cell and molecule of you is this is true because some people think you can't get cremated say it's cheaper say it's cheaper your family member was standing right here said why didn't you cremate me you would have saved money and god will still put everybody back together again one day because is he going to leave all the people who were burnt out somewhere no no you get your body back say yay he's going to look a whole lot better [Music] your spiritual bodies didn't turn you right now you go man i look good because guess what everyone says in heaven man you look good you look funny you look good too but they recognize you it says so in the bible it says you will be known that means your images you'll be known as you were known on the earth so people will know you everyone in heaven knows your first name everyone's going to want a hug say no masks in heaven no social distancing in heaven no handshakes in heaven they give up hugs father abraham will probably be the first one if you make it to the gate because sometimes your family members are waiting outside the gate when you come up to heaven there's a landing place you come no matter how they bring you in jesus's own chariot somebody's chariot a spaceship a world war ii biplane whatever people come in many different things whatever would delight you the most is how you're going to be taken some people step in the elevator and they just go they don't want to mess around they're the people with few layers in their soul okay they got five layers just taken young their angels stepped in this spiritual elevator they step in with the person and up they go and they're there they bypass going to see the whole galaxies and everything which he will take you to see if you want to so even leaving is an experience is a powerful experience but you have layers in you and he made you that way number one spirit soul and body shall we count them say spirits that's a layer body that's a layer soul that's a layer even your body has layers right the skin the muscles the bones you have layers there's no way you can deny that you have layers your spiritual layers are some of the most exciting so people who have a lot of emotions down here probably going to be magnified in heaven your personality gets magnified in heaven yes the jokes are better okay number one there's nothing defiling nothing breaking nothing evil nothing that anybody couldn't see the movies are all clean the jokes are clean stay clean it's heaven most exciting intense beautiful amazing that would wonder and splendor and creatures you've never even seen before are there but he made you layer for different reasons okay so when this layer that you're wearing right now sleeps or like i said it's melted down or whatever happens to it's going to be okay god got it okay he's got that thing so yeah make sure you get cremated it's cheaper i meant people said i'm on i want to give my family member a funeral but would have been seventy thousand dollars of what i had to create it for seven months they're probably happy you did that because guess what we're all going to be back say we'll all be back we get our bodies back they will be young they will be timeless timeless there's no time in heaven everyone is young time doesn't go by okay it comes from god time comes from the father he's in charge of time okay he does things in heaven by events say by events on god's timeline it's whatever event is on there is what's happening there's an event right now it's not send jesus to get the people on the rapture rug that's not what's on there that's way way down way away okay say beginning of time i could draw a timeline all the way down to here [Music] we still have all of this left at least several hundred years maybe more i might still be here amen y'all want to be here during all that time yes are you sure about that no i am i've not been given an option when i said yes to do this and my family knows they already know i'll be here when they're gone their kids are gone their grandkids are going the great friends i'll still be here i'll make them some brownies because he chose me for that and i said yes you know john could have still been here say john that beloved the one who jesus loved will be very scriptural could have remained and be here right now if he chose that god's not a respecter you just have to say yes and you have to be willing yes is nice willing is better willing and obedient is what he needs okay for people who have commissions like that and that's not even my gift my gift i as you look at me i am a photographer my passion that i'd rather do 24 hours a day if i could would be photography i create moments in time that's how i look at it i don't just take a picture there is no taking picture if you take pictures around me i will correct you hold the camera up get the light on it before you bring it down if you stand there you're gonna have a shadow and all those things are outlined when i travel and speak overseas people always want to take pictures what's got a picture of the castle all their 15 friends are lined up you see the top of the castle if i can help you please if you all will stand like this leave a space for the castle then like this you'll all be in it but you can see the castle because this is what you take a picture of right now so that's what i am i was sent from god in my soul photographer when i go to heaven i'll have my own studio please come it'll be for free which is a joke because nothing costs anything anyway i will for sure have a studio because i know whatever gift he made you is what you would do in heaven is what you love the most that's how heaven uprights that's why there's so many things to do in heaven does that make sense to your head well most people thought we would just be worshipping you never stop because when you see all the things he made for you you will worship in the middle of the street anywhere everywhere you start shouting praises to god because he remembered all the things that you love amen there'll be pictures of some of your family members in your mansion and right now they take pictures that you if you lost if they were burned up in a fighter they'll be in your mountain on the wall it's one of the things he does i know i saw somebody's mansion and i saw siblings they have right now and i saw other ones like probably maybe i don't know 10 11 12 something like that they weren't even born yet and i know how many siblings this other person will have so people's mountains will be quite a delight to you your crowning room is massive because you get more than one crown [Music] he gives them out say he gives them out at one time we will throw a specific one we're not going to throw all of them at him we bury him maybe i don't know it's okay to laugh you need to know that humor is one of the number one things in heaven there is peace people go well peace be with them they die don't even rest in the arms of jesus they're not resting [Music] they're riding a roller coaster they're eating desserts somewhere because jesus loves desserts honey was his number one thing he ate while he was on the earth and guess what his cousin ate it too right what did johnny where's the last thing say it loud his family was hooked on honey jesus loved honey we made that that feast for them on the shore fish and it was honey he loves honey guess what he still loves me i have a jar in my pantry that says this is for jesus if he shows up i'm ready and to make this whole thing even funnier people don't think they'll laugh sometimes you laugh or cry when i talk about it sometimes you just don't know what to say because your your natural brains like blanked out a long time ago it's going to be in the ground anyway or where else it ever is but but i was the person in the family of 15 who wanted to number one be alone in a family of 14 siblings i always wanted to be alone was that ever going to happen do you think it was ever going to be about me say no really loud i wanted to be alone and i didn't care if anybody knew who i was i don't know if they knew my name i didn't want to hug anyone i didn't want to hug anybody that won't be kissed don't go to italy unless you want to be kissed if you go to a meeting 500 people you're going to get a thousand kisses because they don't just kiss you once they kiss you on both cheeks kiss kiss kiss kiss by these 400 people they had four four meetings they're making so much for my life so i want to be alone right i didn't want to be hugged or kissed i didn't want anyone to know me i knew two people and all of the schools i attended all three of my schools i knew two people that was it i wasn't seeking for people i was never part of a clique i was probably better off i wasn't a part of any of the crimes and other stuff i never got into that stuff because number one remember i could see i saw the demons around it you didn't have to ask me what hell was involved in heaven was i could see it so i didn't want any of that so here i am just wanted to be left alone that that wasn't going to happen in my life first of all i had to give myself to my family i was always on my parents side that made you unpopular had 150 pets to take care of the person we learned in the bible was how to do a funeral we sent every one of our pets to heaven don't argue with me about that i saw them there like every pet we ever have is in heaven my dad has him on his ranch every time he's someone i hear these words from my father in heaven he gets another one that was my dad's favorite words it was whatever he said about anything he he eat gas he gave himself to the world he loved his enemies literally he loved his enemies it ticked him off he loved everybody dragged him in our house got him a bed on the floor somewhere fed them found them jobs got them clothes helped them get a house that was my dad's part in the world was to be the love of god my brother rj said he was meant to kill wicked people we only did one meeting if you never met my brother rj you should search for someone yeah my brother despises injustice if he ever was a warrior he's the warrior he is the word he lives out in the wilderness away from everybody so he doesn't kill you know half the harvest before they get saved but he won't take down people who call the police i found the criminal you've been looking forward such as there he is already dad but they all know him so you know he's not going to hurt anyone that that didn't deserve it that's what he says our one meeting began together he let me go first and i was just talking about the love of god in heaven and everything then he gives her that high i'm rjs she was uh she was created by god she loved people i'm created to kill him it's a wicked this is the funny thing we were in a block church because almost no white pastors that time would invite me i might tell you something they weren't threatened by me because you know their whole culture they already had heaven culture right yeah and i have a lot about 50 000 black friends i love them all right and they might guess what righteousness truth they want all that they do again the line drawing news that's what god calls him the lion crying news but anyway so that's what he said i'm created to kill people who would take her out or kill people who are wicked and evil and belong to the devil he gets locked on death row he's about my height to minister to people who are about to be taken out yeah and he won't not look down he will not look down most people won't even go there's like three levels of bars between you and the people he'll walk up to the closest bars he can get to put his face right there and stare a hole in him and he move his eyes he'll just sit there and then they'll go like this who do you serve i started the living god of heaven on earth you made you carried you before you he gave you commission said he earth to bring life to people not to hurt them you need to know jesus christ because i know what hell looks like too and you'll burn forever and you won't like it they don't know what to do with him right he goes and gets all these prisoners one to jesus christ he won't back down he's certainly not back now and i won't tell you what he wants to do to those people in the barbed wire in dc so my siblings are very different from each other i learned to love everybody no matter where you're from where you're at you know i can honestly say i love you because god in me loves you so our job here is to love to share the truth right you don't have to force people to get saved you can't do that anyway it has to be a decision in here right and make a decision we just water it you know and share and then water it somebody else water then somebody wins them to jesus christ holy spirit draws them say holy spirit draws them it would be much harder with that holy spirit on the earth okay that's why he was sent way back in jesus time it wasn't easy to live that either but easy to live in the beginning right after jesus left but it certainly is different now and you were made by god very specific when he sent you he wrote words on the will on your will wrote on your actual will sometimes i can see him on people's will because i'm a seer i see spiritual things he wrote words of what he wanted you to be what he created you to be in the earth that book she writes every day of your life in you're in a book that's there you get it when you go to heaven this is what he intended for you this is what he purposed for you but sometimes the enemy got you off track sometimes wicked people did things he didn't intent and he he that was not his purpose he created the earth so he could take you from him where you live and when the time of conception comes holy spirit takes your little spiritual being and knits you together to that dot of flesh that's i knit you together in your mother's womb that's not putting your arms and legs down this nobody on this earth can do this spiritual thing nobody can even know where your spiritual being is the spirit of life talked about the bible was you you wrote in and out on the rays of the rainbow from the father they still do send me i want to i want to love people to send me i want to go to earth for you they'll say that to the father all the time that's what you did you played in the river of life inside him he jumped on the stones and fired a massive gemstones burning with his passion that's where everyone here came from everyone who's on the earth came from that place the father carries you in him in him we live we move we have our being the prophets and poets of the old have spoken of these things that means they will show that it reveals them where they came from everyone no matter what they believe or where they're at right now in this world came from him he is our father we are his offspring his heart is that you know him that you love him that you receive his son so you can be with him in heaven because jesus is the way back to the father and when anyone dies and they are caught up to heaven jesus meets you he walks you up the steps of the throne and says to his father here i have brought them home to you is part of his reward for dying for us he knows everything about you still loves you still wants you has purpose for your life here this is the thing about the babies this is awesome every baby when every baby was sent he wrote on their wills and by the way he wrote whether they were male or female yeah some other group can't teach anybody that i know they'd like to do that too by the way they wrote that on some piece of paper somewhere he wrote in here and when people try to be some other thing that they're not they have great conflict in their soul their soul fights against them because their soul already knows if you're male or female let alone what your body is saying to you they know that's what they were meant to be and i have talked to many people who switched that and have switched back and would all tell me the same thing i had conflict all the time in my soul it would fight and say no that's not you that is not you that's not how you were made you're meant to be i will tell you this there is going to be in one of these of god millions of homosexuals will get born again like like in a sudden a way and if they had operations they get their stuff put back on yeah talk about a sign and a wonder right here he's going to do it he's going to do that because he made us very specifically he made us detailed our personalities are different your personality is still different in heaven you're just nicer if you weren't nice down here you laugh and control me and you won't get to stop it either this place isn't heaven they go just for the laughter okay waves of it come out of places and hit you and just roll on the ground you never did that get used to it practice maybe then i saw a spot i was one of those people that didn't laugh i was so serious i was serious serious with the capital s i was serious i was serious i wanted everything to be done right that was me you know when my mom knew she left me the house would still be burning and not be burnt down that i'd know where everybody was and they'd be okay they may not be happy with me but but that was my assignment to keep everybody together and keep them safe and i i made like 10 sandwiches every day for their lunch and helped them with homework at night then if i was they were sick i've got to pray for them and sit with them until they were better and this was my life this was my life like young my life and i didn't say no to my parents i honored my mother and my father i get to do this now i get to have pink hair which was ordered by heaven okay i get to eat cake i still have to watch how much i eat okay i celebrate all the time because i already know i know what my end is i also pretty much know what your end is and it's because i'm willing have been taken back in the past and shown how things happen so i can give revelation taken forward in the future i've had glimpses of the new earth and all the other worlds around it i've seen father son holy spirit seven spirits of god melchizedek who is the father's high priest and always has been he has always had flesh on him i'm going to really mess with your mind now now has always had flesh before god made flesh on people on the earth he's really neat looking he serves the father at the obedience of the father he came to the earth became the king of salem collected tithes from abraham that's why he could see him he's also the one who's oh head of the tribe of angels that there's a whole tribe of angels that god put flesh on so you can send them to the earth as watch your angels not all of them fell everybody says oh my god not all of them some did some did not they have flush that's why they can make offspring i hope your answers are getting given okay but melchizedek still serves the father that's his position personal high priest to the living god the seven spirits of god also serve god they serve him they are his that means they serve him that doesn't mean that they're his seven attributes everybody every syllabus i've ever seen okay seven spirits of god here's the syllabus and in five minutes i can tell you what it is okay how to explain the trinity some people can't they think we have a three-headed god no they have the ability to step inside of each other father you know son holy spirit holy spirit steps in the father jesus steps in the father here's the three in one and that's how he showed me helped up to heaven said i'm going to show you the three in one and they all came i said here we are father son holy spirit in a couple minutes of time if there was time i understood what people have tried to figure out for years when he said jesus said father me and you when you and me he literally meant me inside you and you inside me and when they began to create before there was anything there was heaven the father's house there's nothing but the spirits around the father would step up where there's nothing he would speak physical realm jesus stepped out of him he was called the word stepped out and a drop of water in his hand he stretched it into a canvas and he wrapped it around just like this a huge part of the spirit realm and we created the physical round and then he began to hang the planets on there anything visible he couldn't hang physical things on a spiritual thing that's why spirits can walk through this physical wall because the original realm supersedes this physical realm which is temporal that's how he did it and from that moment they began to create everything in the physical realm we created the planets they didn't make the sun in the moon yet because the first earth when he made it the first time was lit with his glory millions of years between verse one mercy millions millions say millions i hope that messes up your mind too you know who doesn't mess it up it doesn't mess up scientists they ask the uh i'm not going to say astrological the astronomy people already have an understanding that this earth is well well over millions and millions and millions and millions of years old those who dig in the dirt and find the dinosaurs and the layers of the earth they already understand that man man man has been here for a limited time but the earth itself has been here for a very very long time so when there's darkness covering the earth because of what happened before that right in the beginning means before there was time in the beginning was when the earth was just a thought in god's head when he made the earth it was perfect it was beautiful there was no sin in it he said to watch your angels to watch over all the creatures that were on the earth the dinosaurs roamed the earth there was a water vapor shield around the whole earth that put mist on the ears because it hadn't rained there had been no storms yet on the earth there was only one landmass and all this ocean was around it how do i know he took me back in time and showed me how he created the heavens and the earth and when i explain this to an evolutionist they want to know god because they have answers to the questions they've always had what about that footprint they found by the dinosaur that was a watcher angel who had flesh on him so his footprint was in the dirt there's no crow magnum man there were never there never was a chromatin a man okay god didn't make people that were half ape and half person and put them on the earth okay we are we didn't come from monkeys say we didn't come from monkeys say we're made in the image of god he's not a monkey the angels laugh every time they hear us every time they watch the slime pool thing every time they watch someone talk about the big bang they laugh so hard they would cry if they could [Music] because that takes a lot more faith to believe than god making us putting us here right so having this involved very much in our lives always has been involved the angels are all over in here they all your angels are here and most of mine are outside because they couldn't fit in here and god gave me promises all kinds of promises just said yes i'll do this for you however long it takes i don't care he said one day i'll open their eyes everybody will see the angels one day i'll take everybody to heaven so everybody raise always do this raise your hand up say we're ready right now take us for a trip let's see if it happens not today that may seem strange to some people but one day it will be happening the closer we get towards the end and the end for people might be the rapture but i can tell you this all the stuff in the bible is going to happen it will all happen the tribulation the perilous times it's going to happen christening on the third jerusalem is going to happen for that thousand years satan being taken off the earth during the time is going to happen he'll be back on the earth to tempt all the ones who were born people lived to be seven eight nine hundred years old during that time uh if you died at 100 that would be like a child say timelessness is coming to the earth before them yes it said that there would be a generation of people on the earth that would taste of the powers of the age to come the age to come after this age we're in is the millennial age so he's not done with this one yet it's not going to end okay but there would be people living in your time i'm saying over the next couple hundred years in this time who will be timeless will begin not to age who will travel to the spirit realm all the time rather than the physical realm who do amazing signs and wonders for him that's why he needs this time right now to clean a lot of the evil off of the earth he can't even send new inventions there's inventions that haven't happened yet that will actually make our life so much easier and so different that he won't put them here until the evil is pushed back say god is not willing to give those inventions to the wicked if you see his big picture about all this is happening you will understand why all the evil is being exposed and it's being exposed all over the world why is this happening say god's going to clean that platform off collard so we can step into the greater days of glory that's why if everything had happened is normal and there's all kinds of stuff going on we didn't know if everything had happened as normal on november 3rd then a lot of that would never be found out it wouldn't be known the evil wickedness would still be there hiding plotting and planning and god isn't going to do some things until a lot of them are taken off who understands please raise your hand if you were god and you had great things to send to the earth would you allow all that to remain and you can see just in our country alone how that has interfered you can imagine saying no holds barred for anybody easier than what you want to it would be really hard to have any of that happen right so he does have a plan it is going to we are having justice it will come not just here but around the world and there's be some people here you will see no more see there'll be people here say it wicked people who will be here no more that is his plan amen amen so you're living in different days this is all different our lives have had to be different right it's going to be worth it for what is coming that no man can stop or interfere with and your family member is going to be running to you to find out who jesus christ is there's going to be a lot of salvations happening because people number one are going to know there's a god because only god could do all what's going to be done so on god's timeline we're right there at one of his things right now on his timeline right now we're there so everybody here is born because he needs you here he wants you here okay no one is a mistake no matter how you got here or who he sent you to he never purpose evil for you or harm or tragedy so everybody's seeing enough we're going to do oh we're going to do a soul checkup and i do it for the sake of those who probably wouldn't ever do it this is available to the body of christ to be free of everything that's hindered you hurt you any tragedy anything that happened in your life that you keep having memories of maybe even nightmares about you won't have them no more if you're involved in addictions and you sincerely lose that addiction from your soul he'll come down and pull out of you amen and this is something the father taught me himself it's the first time i actually looked at my clock and then he told me that i'm going to teach you something and i looked at my clock it's all the time when i came back it was four hours later my staff had been beating on my door my daughter come over to see me and i didn't answer anybody my body was there i wasn't there he took me and showed me how he made a human soul why he mean it that way how important it is to understand the fullness of the peace of the kingdom i'm telling you about the keys of the kingdom that's what this is you call it something else he calls it a soul checkup you should do it all the time i used to teach it once and then that was nice and i found out a few weeks later no this is a lifestyle if someone says something horrible bashing hurting to you you turn around loose those words from your soul and him will go and it will be to you like they never happened if you saw traumas if you had tragedies if you lose that tragedy from your soul he'll come down and go shh it'll be like it never happened to you you can talk about it there's no hurt there's no fear there's no suffering no matter what it was you don't have to have that in you he doesn't want it in you his explanation to me was i don't have time for them to have six weeks or six months or six years of therapy i don't have that kind of time i need them free i need them free right now that's why i'm going to teach you this and if you're willing to learn it and train them then i will show you who melchizedek is you give me promises i'll do this for you and i didn't ask him i'll do this for you do this video i'll do this for you and of course you know i said yes i know you'd be the whole world i'd be training that's okay it's the most important thing you probably learn other than knowing jesus christ you can walk through your life with no pain no suffering no fear no grief no traumas no addictions now it may try to come back to you saying nope i got rid of you i'm not taking you back and the devil will try to bring back whatever he can you say nope it's gone and i've done this with too many people for you to try to tell me it doesn't work it does work so if you're a born-again believer you can do this okay so first i always start with we're all going to repent and say father father i come before your throne i come before you i love your son jesus christ i love you right now i'm going to clean up my salt right now i'm going to clean it up i repent of any sin since my original repentance i don't want any of it in me so i'm giving it back to your son i thank you jesus thank you jesus for cleansing my soul for blessing my soul that i can be free of all sin amen amen now we're going to do this soul checkup i will list things that you need to lose from your soul but if i don't say something you can say that yourself and everyone does it so nobody's going to be figured out or pointed out the one thing i will see is stuff leaving you i'ma the seer i will see jesus come down he pulls gray matter out of you that's what it looks like it looks like gray because you have the light of god but if you have darkness in there if you play with sin or play with stuff and the enemy looks in you he will see gray he will go after you he'll already go after you so that's why number one you don't want to keep it right he also doesn't want people bashing screaming yelling because you sound like hell when you do that our words are supposed to bring life yes amen we're here to bring light and love and life those three things that's why you're here so if you have anger issues there's something in your soul that keeps making you do that so you can lose anger from your soul it won't ever come back again don't go watch 10 movies with profanity in them i have to say this about profanity that is hell's language you are literally speaking the language of hell if they hear enough they're going to start showing up because they recognize those words that's why god says no profane word should come out of your mouth there it is right there no profane words should be spoken by you amen it's not in heaven no one in heaven talks like that i've been to hell three times and it was filled that's the only language they speak so we don't want to represent now we're not here for that right and i'm sure you may have good reasons to get angry or upset it says you can be angry and sin not okay don't add that to your list we're not supposed to wound people with our words so please don't bash people when people they say this when people lash out at you they're afraid fear causes people to lash out they'll never admit that they won't even think that but fear makes you lash out that's what happens and i always know that person needs help if they're bashing me they need help and so that's how i look and that's how god has taught me to look at it so we should always be here to help people if people don't like you or they're mean to you please forgive them go in a room forgive them loose all of it out of your soul whatever it is maybe teach little kids do this even little kids if they're if they're bashed at school or bullied at school you as their parent can lay your hand on their head and say as a watcher over their soul i choose to loose from my child's soul all the hateful mean ugly words that were spoken to him today i loose them in jesus name and jesus will come down and pull them out of the soul of the child and those children will act like it never happened you have the right to do that because you're the parent amen so this is something you can live do for the rest of your life when something happens immediately to you that's the best time to do it if you're in grief i understand you miss somebody but don't let that grief still be there a year two years three years five years like don't build like a memorial it's okay to put the pictures on the wall i'm saying don't go in there and reap over them all the time they're in heaven saying please have a life they're up there saying please laugh please let it go please release me some people if your parents or loved ones have died and you're still grieving you need to say these words i choose with my will to release my loved one into the hands of jesus to complete whatever destiny he has for them in heaven when you do that they will hear that in heaven number one it will make them very happy it will remove grief out of you that didn't leave yet okay you don't want a spirit of grief which doesn't go in here but will speak to you all the time about how horrible it was that they died they repeat how they die they don't think about how they died they just know one thing they're happy they're there and people got saved in the last minute are really happy they're there they made a beautiful three-level cabin on the river of wherever in heaven but they may not have a mansion the size of new york city but you know they're not upset with anyone who has something greater because those people that was a reward for their life amen so we're going to say i choose i choose as the believer in jesus christ the believer in jesus christ to lose from my soul every anger purple bashing [Music] i lose [Music] i lose that from my soul every fear every year every i'm trying to think of what the words are some natural words um they'll come in just a minute i lose any fear any oppression any depression any thoughts of suicide i loosen from my soul at least from my soul any hate any vengeance any effects and the unforgiveness and it was spoken against me that i was involved that were spoken against me out wrongfully against me i lose all of that and lose all of that from my soul from my soul jesus name i lose from my soul any pornography any pedophile any wicked defiled things that i looked at before watched they were forced for [Music] and he laughed any poverty any poverty any wealth that was stolen i forgive those people in jesus name i was not made to live i am not keeping it in jesus name can attack me in any of those ways i lose it from my soul in jesus name i lose from my soul any unrighteousness anything it took me beyond what god allows what god loves beyond the boundaries he except for us as believers i lose all that from my soul at least from my soul and he failed and he failed here any thoughts of failure any failed activities or businesses or plans or plays of the enemy he took me out of them i will not i will be associated with failure i am above i am not beneath any thoughts any thoughts of being beneath me i will not keep them against any any hurting crippling crushing controlling words that i spoke over others i boost them from my soul i lose from my soul deep sadness unfounded sadness that has no ground i will not keep that in my soul i was [Music] any deceiving words that were spoken to me or about me that i heard on the news any fake news i would lose from my soul any lies about this time any corruption that i heard spoken i use all of that i will not make judgments from that i loose it all for myself in jesus name any thoughts i've had of being unimportant and not measuring up not being what god wanted me to be those words did not come from god i will not keep those thoughts i will not keep those take them captive loosen from my soul in jesus name and we're going to wait a few minutes while he just pulls all that out and [Music] now we're going to bind the things of god to our soul this is one way you can stay happy every day of your life you choose to be happy you choose to be what god called you to be no matter what's going around you but when those things aren't in you it's much easier but if you want the fullness of god you can ask for more than just your rent being paid food on your table you know things that need to be fixed or hold us fine but he wants you to be more than that you have not because you asked not today we're going to ask to have things bound to our soul when you do that he comes and he puts them in you some of them come in waves i see whole waves of the joy of the lord whole waves of his presence whole waves of his life so we're going to who do you are you all ready to ask for them yes say i choose as an act of my will to bind to my soul my soul the love of god the love of god the life of god the light of god the presence of the lord the joy of the lord his creativity his creativity his expectations yes his validation my gift that he gave this word i will meditate on all the time all the time in jesus name i bind to my soul the goodness of god and it will be evident the life of god and it will come for me the glory of god that we are seated in christ christ in me is the hope of glory that i bind to my soul i bind to my soul his will his plan to release it to the just in the righteousness that promise my mind to my soul by him to my soul sound wisdom extreme discernment i can operate for him the way he needs to be in jesus name so be it [Applause] amen [Music] he has great plans for all of us and it doesn't depend on your age your position doesn't depend on anything but one thing you belong to his son right do you mean that decision to accept christ and his sacrifice i know a lot about things that happened the day that he died on the cross a lot about what happened from the moment his he had his spirit leave his body i think if he hadn't told him to leave he might still be there because he did he commanded the spirit mentally leave his body and his body was taken down it was placed in the tomb god appointed two angels to be with christ through many different times in his life if it said angels came and comforted him it was the same two angels that they were always with and they were with him in the garden they were chosen to bring that cup that cup is a real cup the thing he drank all the wickedness and evil and every sin and wickedness that existed he drank that that's what had to be nailed to the cross it wasn't just his physical body it's what he carried to the cross if people ask you how come jesus is the only one who can forgive sins you tell them that he's the only one to drink all of the evil of every single sin into his being and was willing to nail back to the cross and at that time he can abolish sin in our lives when we repent is the only one who's done that he's the only one who's made that sacrifice willing so he is the only one that has the power to forgive sin and he is the only way back to heaven someone else has another heaven good luck the one i saw belonged to the god of the bible his son jesus christ holy spirit so many angels millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of angels i've seen in heaven around in heaven all over the earth they belong to him amen he made them for specific purposes they're made in tribes like there's tribes of watcher angels tribes of couriers trying of scribes and then there is the army of heaven that is a whole different creature when it talks about the living creatures before the throne of god you're pretty much describing most of the army of heaven they don't look normal they don't look like human eye and they have wings whether you ever see them or not some are made out of just force i can't even explain that they they don't have any kind of shape that you can identify some have eyes some have 30 eyes some have eyes all over their body some have eyes in the front in the back some have two heads front and front i'm not going to explain that hello hello i was present when they brought a gift to my grandson when he was born and he is a carrier of the love of god and he's going to be an athlete who will win olympics and he's focused he's got two things in his life he's so focused i can't figure his brain out he can run faster than his father or anybody who's ever tried to beat him but what he will talk to you about is the love of god he was assigned these two angels who were one being and their names are passion and compassion and they're with him all the time he has other angels who are with him uh his main angel's name is flash your number one angel assigned to you is because of the gift you have mine is about 40 foot tall i've never seen him when i was a little tiny thing i could see him following me around all the time i apologize to him all the time you probably shouldn't have heard me say that i'm sorry then he grins at me sometimes he rolls his eyes at me but not often he's there to protect me to watch over me sometimes he'll bring me things from heaven and but but this grandson's angels always uh oh i know all my brain kids angels actually speak to them hi thank you for watching over them you know they're going to be going here i know you know that but just pay attention and and so yeah the one who's fast is almost the speed of light the first one is the first friends and is very creative he started making trips to him when he was three he seen my dad talk to my dad described my dad he never met my dad on the earth my dad keeps giving his favorite candies candies were around in the 50s that they don't even have anymore he's gone inside of a volcano in heaven and rode the lava hound with my dad he described cars that could drive up the side of mountains without wheels they exist in heaven i never told him about that he's been making trips now for five years and he'll just say the most surprising things come out of his mouth nobody's saying anything he could lead a service baptized so get people saved baptized in water cast demons out they have never been a trim in the public school that was probably a good thing you'd be down the principal's office all the time your son just baptized someone in the water fountain again and he would yeah and the second one is over the love of god will pray for everybody if he sees anyone limp in the store anyway he'll run up to them in jesus name be healed and the third one is a girl and she would be she will dance and sing and there will be weapons she'll be very fierce they should named her middle name fierce and i got two pages on her before she was born one whole one and a half pages of how fierce it she'll be she is fierce she runs for brothers she totally understands things from god she's for sees things here's things her passion to worship surpasses everything else she's got she's all about worship singing and dancing and now she's wanting to learn to play the violin i'm sure that will be very dangerous to hell when she does that because what you do in worship is dangerous against hell your prayers are your worship is however you do that by that's painting danger to how when you sing dance if you flag whatever it is that you do is worship you create images that are captured and taken before the throne of god so she's fierce her angel that protects her is the size of a mountain his name is rock and he's got this little tiny person that he follows around you know i every time i visit wherever they're all at i thank them all the time for watching over them and so i know their names i know what they will be one of my rewards god loves children she needs children you are not just raising a child you are shaping souls to the kingdom and i talk more about the kingdom usually than i do the actual world that's why christ came he came to tell us about the gospel of the kingdom it wasn't just about dying that's just how everything begins with you ruling and reigning in the spirit realm is what he actually has for you you rule with him because he rules we have ultimate authority in this earth over this earth over anything in this earth everything of satan has been put under our feet we have power over all say all the power of the enemy we're going to learn how to use it we are he's starting something new brand new right in the middle of all this time actually gave all the revelation about it on the day of the fake inauguration it will happen the body will learn who they are what your authorities in the spirit realm how to use that authority how to crush darkness push it back it'll be a different life to live in this world amen demons will run from you they won't try to attack you they will try to get away from you because what you carry will cause great pain to them yes the light and the glory of god is painful to the enemy that's why when it showed up in hell on the third day they were screaming their faces were melting they couldn't get away from christ fast enough that is what it's going to be like to live in this world with you so you're not unimportant you're not just a person you're not an old sinner say by grace don't ever say that again you are considered royalty in heaven your manifested sons and daughters of the most high god you are the love of jesus christ life he gave everything for you that's how much he loves you holy spirit can't wait to get to know you better he will share things with you that will probably undo your natural mind because heaven is not this world it's only a shadow earth is a shadow of what is in heaven and what he has waiting for all of us now in this life probably won't be repeated again what he starts now will continue until the end of this age and even those christians who would become christians during the tribulation will be a thorn in the flesh of satan they won't be crying they won't be hiding when it comes time it's going to be executed i've already been shown that they will be dancing in the line which would be the biggest irritation to say who finding things i'm really going to get them now they'll already know they already had trips to heaven by that time a lot of people will be uh it will be normal for people to be caught up to have many times doing greatest some of the greatest things on the earth until things begin to switch okay i cannot tell you for sure that the body will not be on this earth when that happens but i will just repeat what the word says until he that is with hell is removed the antichrist cannot appear on the earth well i can tell you what if we were all here he would be able to do nothing he is not here anywhere in the earth right now god wouldn't be starting these greater days of glory with so much power of god being seen and felt and known in the earth satan would not be able to fulfill his thing his few years his bump in the road that's what god says he gets a bump in the road he won't be able to operate that operate like that in those days people will be looking for a savior someone who can rescue them from the horrific perils times which will also be a short time they will take anybody okay so who shows up is the antichrist and he's actually going to be good for the first three and a half years to fool everybody he only does all the evil stuff the last three and a half years and he still won't get the whole world i don't know why people think he will he won't there's going to be rednecks here that will not want him that will not take satan even during the tribulation and there will be people on the earth when christ comes to sit on the thorn in jerusalem that didn't die even during that time and they will have a long time to make their decision for christ you have still have to get saved even during the time when christ is on the throne and some of those kings how about this want one in there knowing he's the son of god knowing he will actually control the weather and all these other things he will sit as king of the world and they will want in there so the satan is loosed 1 000 years later out of the pit he will have no authority or power in the earth for that 1000 years christ will have holy ruling in the earth there will be people who survive the tribulation that will live here during that time so sometimes you'll understand things sometimes you had a big picture given to you right now we still have a long way to go but at this point in history in heaven and on the earth are the greater days it's not the darker days amen i know some pastors if they don't have revelation and they don't know what's going on they always go to the end this is the tribulation everybody get ready for all this to happen it's not going to happen evil is not taking over this world right now it's actually going to be diminished for a very long time so thank you for letting me share make sure you make it tomorrow i will be talking about america i'll be wearing my red white and blue amen stand up so i can speak a blessing i'll just tell you we have stuff back there you might be interested in i almost never get to share about it but we do have some things i just sincerely want to speak a blessing over your lives if you don't come tomorrow well then i will just speak over you tonight amen raise your hands father i thank you for your children that are here tonight god who paid a price to be here their time their energy their efforts god and right now father i release to this room the healing power of jesus christ whether it is emotional whether it's physical whether it's mental in jesus name i speak wholeness to your bodies to your minds to your spirits in jesus name that you will walk out of your hole totally and completely the way he made you in jesus name and anybody watching online i release that to you also wholeness in your body wholeness in your mind wholeness in your emotions in jesus name and god i ask for specifically those who are here and those watching online god that you give a download of your wealth to each and every person here father a god that you have a desire in your heart you don't have to wait until that great transfer happens father you may show them your goodness by changing their finances in one week god i want to hear reports of the miraculous father the unexpected the suddenlies that are already starting in this world god let it happen to everyone who is present god and everyone who's watching and not because they have to know you love them but because i want you to do it for them i am willing and obedient god and i thank you for a blessing for myself that you will let every single person here experience the unexpected suddenlies from your hand in jesus name i declare it to be so and everyone said amen i receive it thank you amen

welcome you in this place thank you Jesus thank you Lord now I feel like the Holy Spirit is this gonna thicken his presence right now there's some of you who have been crying out I gotta have more I'm not satisfied I gotta have more and God has been stirring your heart he's been blowing on the coals of your heart the flames of your heart to ignite it into a mighty blaze and so lo let tonight be that night why wouldn't he do it tonight [Music] Jesus said blessed are the hungry are you guys hungry tonight yeah blessed are those who hunger and thirst come on how many want to be blessed tonight we've got a hunger and thirst for him and for his righteousness and you'll be filled and so Lord fill us tonight we pray or we want to step out of the natural into the supernatural realms of the kingdom of God into that place where all things are possible tonight we pray thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen well welcome good to have you I think we're gonna receive an offering right now if we are the ushers ready so we're gonna receive an offering when a hundred percent goes to Kat Kerr ministries and if you if you're making a check make it to the healing rooms and also if you need use a credit card you could just raise your hand or if you need an envelope we'll give you an envelope for tax purposes just raise your hand so we you get many ways you can give tonight well I don't know about you but I'm really expecting it's been a great day today so far and we haven't seen anything yet and so again we want to welcome you to the Healing Rooms Apostolic Center and you know I I just I always say this because it happens almost every time we meet together you just may be healed it happens in the glory here all the time we have so many angels here on assignment and I just I just got a feeling some of New York and just going to get healed you know a lot of times it happens during worship happens during the word and so we definitely haven't opened heaven and this is a place where miracles happen so when you feel the presence of the Lord we like to say it like this just reach out reach out and touch him and receive your miracle tonight all right it's been excited we were living in supernatural times and this has been a supernatural week I'm sure every here knows that Paul Kane went to be with the Lord last Tuesday evening and today was the afternoon when his body was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just different the signs and wonders happening throughout the week and and so I know that we're in the midst but we're always in the midst of the supernatural but it just seems like something special and so we invited Kat a while ago and of course nobody but God knew that Paul was gonna go home and actually be buried on the first day when she's speaking and I know that it's not a coincidence I don't know exactly what it means maybe she does but I know stuff like that is not just a coincidence so we're really blessed and honored Kat to have you here again and I'm sure how many of you have never been in a live cat care meeting Oh a lot of you good you're in for a treat so why don't you can make your way up Kat you need to come up around this way and yeah you ready oh and while she's coming up somebody dropped their glasses so if that's you you probably can't see but here they are when I put them up here so Kat um well brought those in you don't know the Lord's been taking her to heaven for several years and showing her things and bringing her back and allowing her to share with us so let's just welcome cat Kirk [Applause] Wow [Applause] I know some people know why I'm saying that some may not when the army of heaven goes to battle against the darkness that is their war cry why because they're excited you're gonna crush the enemy's plans over you right they're gonna crush them they're gonna pull down strongholds that have been rising against you that's why they were created news flash from heaven they weren't created to protect heaven they were made by the creator of heaven they didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third of the angels out then you get to do that Michael hell them and the Father sent a lightning bolt a million megawatts of love from himself and took him out and then one third of angels went out the same way so they've been waiting a long time to war on our behalf full time amen I may or may not give you scripture for that tonight go look it up I think most of us know that Jesus was the lord of state loud the host is the name of the army of heaven yes they're still part of the angel tribes but they're different in many ways the ones under Gabriel have many different positions and jobs in heaven and on the earth and they look more like us they're the ones who look more like us the army of heaven mostly does not look anything like us they're creatures most of them are creatures they're fierce looking they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps so what the Holy Spirit says they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps however there was one time when they had to take the place of the worship angels which were the one-third that were kicked out the only ones Lucifer got were the ones he was over he was over one-third of the angels was the worship angels obviously if he was the one who led them in worship all the time in heaven I'm just gonna give you full out Revelation because I want to take advantage of all the time I have so if you didn't know this he used to step inside God to lead worship he covered over the very heart of God with his wings which were embellished with gems he had gems on his back on his front people go well he had just a few no he had really hundreds of them on him and when God made him he made mountings like in a ring and every gem was mounted and amounting like a ring that you would wear like this one here and he was beautiful which is one of the reasons why he ended up by falling from pride from his beauty also he thought he was smarter than God and that was a that was busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz you're gonna laugh a lot tonight alright heaven laughs every time the devil loses down here all of heaven roars yes they know what's going on and today they were attendants for Paul Cain with Paul Cain not talking about the body talk about his spirit man everyone gets to see their own homecoming isn't that nice so we're colors and play lots of music and dance because that's what they'll be doing in heaven news flash from heaven number two they don't have a funeral in heaven when you come home say Amen you shouldn't expect one we should have a party zone down here when we send people off instead of a funeral home someone opened a party zone I promise you'll make more money than other people with funeral homes cuz even the world will want to send theirs off wherever they think they're going they'll pick a party anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea I've been giving up for years I don't think anybody's done it yet so there you go the more real heaven becomes to the body of people will want to send them off with a real celebration because of the reality of what heaven is and what they're going to be experiencing there it won't make sense to have a sad funeral while they're watching from the party I'm a seer that means I see in the unseen realm okay mister I'm really happy Danny because I got to experience all that heaven was doing and what was going on with Paul Kane and his mother and his sisters you know his family that's up there and the others who were attending up there watching his service he enjoyed every funny thing that was told he likes to be real so he liked all the reality of who he was he liked that personal side of him being talked about so next time you plan a family members homegoing service tell some jokes because they will laugh I was at a service one time and back home and it was um trying to member the guys name I remember told McClellan he was part of story side B and he died suddenly and I came into his service I didn't know anyone but I was coming to bring some books about heaven to his family the Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him watching from the portal that was really difficult you know to try to pretend to be sad and I never wear black it's okay if you if you go to somewhere where they're expecting you know to do what is proper not to upset them but no one's wearing black in heaven they're not and they aren't having to partying there was I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what I don't know you know helps my human head lots of times because they kind of took that away from me I used to be kind of brilliant really then they made me like eight years old life is much easier being that way you know what you don't worry about things you don't think about what's gonna happen five years down the road when you don't even know or you already planned you know prepare for disasters or something I never got that really if we're over the weather then we shouldn't be concerned about the weather we rule over it amen okay she didn't know news bulletins number three writes number three are you keeping track you're gonna get a gift number three Jesus was over the weather we are joint ears we get to be over the weather and that great you're gonna see that more and more I'm serious you're gonna see it more and more things stop like stop can't wait for that to happen meteorologists might have to get another job not making fake news by the way they don't work now and it's not gonna work when it's not actually happening what was I talking about number three boys over over the weather Jesus was over the weather and he tried so hard to teach his disciples he really was in case you didn't know they were in boot camp with him for three years it wasn't just watch what I do it's learn what I do and then do it right he was gonna go he's gonna go back for some R&R and he had to make sure they understood how this whole thing works being a joint heir with Christ what do you have we have he said so himself the things I did how point-blank can you get the things and the works I have done you will do well you forgot the first part you will do also okay these are just the works you got to do the works say we got to do the works then we get to do the greater say it louder okay like you're excited well I don't just try things I actually do them there's a difference I'm just gonna try that means you're not making much of a plan about that right but doing it the works I did you will do they do also and greater works you will do I think that means we're socially doing something we're entering into a busy season a busy season operating in the supernatural not just talking about it a busy season handling the wealth of the wicked not just talking about it a busy season living not just existing doing the more say the more the more is amazing are you getting better I am just as passionate about living holy as I am about being funny and I will tell you I I have to I have to give you both sides of heaven there's two sides in heaven there's holy profound the other whole half of heaven is funny say funny everybody have they've thought for ever and for ages that it would be boring in heaven maybe because all they do is worship let me tell you you stand in front of him it's not boring whether you're staring feeling like you're going to faint melting to the ground you know you feel like you don't have breath in you because of just being near him yeah it is an honor a privilege and amazing when you worship and it's not normal not even worship as normal in heaven you ride on it you create things as you're worshiping him you're creating when you worship given the devil a big black eye and a very bad day when you worship Him you are shredding bashing and crushing his fake little wannabe Kingdom in the second heaven when you worship Him it's amazing from doing one thing for him to honor him to bless him to adore him what destruction you do against the kingdom of darkness that's my favorite second thing I don't do demons I do do Jesus though I love him I honor him I can't do anything without him it's because of him and with him and it is his plan even the pink hair is his plan because he's not boring there's nothing boring about him there's absolutely nothing boring about heaven there's nothing boring about our future that's like in the next few days the more you believe things are real the more real they will become and that is actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit realm truth the more you believe it is real and talk about it being real and write about it being real and actually acting in it being real the more real it's going to become to you it's the original realm it's the eternal realm it's not the temporary realm this is a temporary life for you it's a temporary place to live a temporary to do things because this earth is not eternal I know people have worked it out in their own mind with their head research and they're looking up stuff and sometimes assuming because I've read a lot of translations and someone kind of miss it I know because the Holy Spirit shows me those scriptures then he'll show me 30 scriptures of it being translated I take the word for the value it gives it's real it is for us to repair us to accelerate us to propel us into high places you never dreamed of doing things you never dreamed of we are living examples of the Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth that's why you're here you here to be like them look like them and act like them I don't see any failure in any of that I don't see hopelessness worthlessness I don't see fear at all one of the first things the Holy Spirit gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what we decided to call him there's so many we don't know what to call and we didn't just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a Kingdom quote was don't let fear interfere that was a good one right teach me never to fear never say never at all in any way fear does not control our life we do not partner with fear he didn't put fear in us when he made us we're supposed to be fearless and timeless everybody should be yelling I receive it say timeless we're supposed to be timeless he said you had to die I'm being serious not funny now serious John didn't have to die did he say no didn't Jesus say to the disciples what is it so in other words he's saying it doesn't matter what they think you probably actually said that he's a character he's the son of God but he is a character the problem with the biggest characters in heaven except for Holy Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by that much who they called the drama King Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit is a drama King you haven't only seen just a little bit of his activity so far waiting to the full fledge release on this earth he's excited he's excited about what's about to happen in us they've been waiting a long time say they've been waiting a long time if I say the word day I mean the Trinity they're not boring none of them they know how to step inside of each other and be one one thing that's how it happens I know I was eight years old father caught me up before the throne and said I'm going to show you how the three can be one and a five-year-old can understand that man's head knowledge has expanded it and expanded it and all kind of could use every other kind of word explaining that you know multiply it whatever you want to call it made it look amazing powerful and hard to understand it's simple they can step inside of each other Jesus said father I pray that one day that they be one even as we are one because he steps inside his father all the time when he was the word he did the same thing I didn't forget I was only on number three bulletins by the way I've got some more I was the least likely person to anyone on this earth would have chosen to do this okay I'm from a tribe like a real one 15 people in an alligator and an iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs and lizards and spiders we grew up with them in our home I had seven brothers what did you think in Florida you add that up that's what that comes to sell your bike to some kid for a pig bring him home wrap him up and close and you have a new pet overnight we never knew what was going to be in our home so I didn't need anyone's opinions I was never part of a group or a clique I had a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a dead person standing before you dead people are wonderful for God to use they're not full of self they don't have their own opinion and the devil cannot use a dead person the more dead you are to yourself the more dangerous you are against hell there are many ways to kill me before I even grew up and you know it doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in this room I loved all my siblings I survived I conquered I was a leader wasn't liked all the time but I was a big help to my parents I honor my parents greatly every day of my life I loved them I didn't want to hurt them they needed help say parents they need help pastors they need more help I'm grateful people can start a church Oh No I've already died I don't need a church I don't need a whole congregations of people although I love them I bless you all but I really bless the pastor because they die every day to be that amen you'll notice that God didn't actually send his son to be a pastor did you ever notice that they actually sent him as a businessman God loves business people they're easy they know how to listen they know how to complete things that are given to them they don't leave things out forget things ignore things they do a job amen so he sent his son as a businessman who could easily connect with the sinners and he did they ate with him all the time they liked him he was exciting he was interesting he was funny his favorite job was to offend the hierarchy he was good at it and yet lived holy did miracles raise the dead they took money from people for spotted lambs they weren't high on God's list and he had to train his disciples I know he only had him for three years and I think most of them finally got it after he left but they did give him credit they did but in the beginning I'm sure Jesus would go to the Father when he went to the mountain all the time and say are you sure I have to that fight all the time they brawl over women I have one who wants to be everything until everybody that that would be Peter I have a treasure you know that cheats all the time right you know that you know he takes money all the time I know you know that too and I have a tax collector and every time you walk down the road to go Minister we get stones thrown at us because they don't like him I don't know anybody who likes tax clusters they didn't back then either so he did not give him the best or the easiest to Train and I know I was saying something to God about my some of my staff and he said I didn't make it easy for my son in my conversation ended with that subject especially when he caught me up me took me back and I got to walk through a whole day of their lives like in their first year of being together all right God I can make it God has a plan for you every single person is important to him and I do know this your birth was timed on this earth God created time he knew you before you were born because you played inside of him he saw you if there was time he saw you all the time how great is see that he was huge he could make himself as big as he wanted to and he walked on the mountains he was out where there was nothing and he spoke and the world would step out of him and make space that God would make himself small enough to step inside himself and play with you he did say he's not a man he's God and even being that great he knew everything about you knew the mistakes knew our faults knew everything that had great hope and great plans for you to do great things so it's no mistake you're here now in this age instead of the ages before this time you're here right on time for the accelerator time for the more of God for the kingdom age for the time to command the hosts of heaven handle the wealth by host cities for him to use because he's not poor he knows the names of your children that you'll have even before you get married he knows them and he put them in your family line on purpose in this generation that's here now this is a special generation for God it's the beginning of the group and type of people that will remain until all things be fulfilled some well the Bible says there'll be a group of people like that a group and type of people a generation that we're generation means a group and type of people it doesn't mean like 30 years or actually that word in the Bible that says Jesus says that there'll be a group and Type O people on earth that will be here when all things be fulfilled including the coming of him that word means a group and type of people that work generation means that there will be a grouping type of people on this earth that also says in the Bible that would taste of the powers say powers of the age to come that would be the Millennial age of course there's people now let's say they're not going to be in millennium I go about what the Bible says there will be a millennium there will be a Tribulation God caused a bump in the road it will happen that's on his timeline in heaven so no matter what other people have come come up with or assume or have putting in translations I promise you it's going to happen and you can't make it happen or not happen anyway so to me it's not worth agreeing over God's gonna work out his plan all the way to the end right I'm excited to know that I'm part of that generation that will tasted the powers of the age to come that's why you need revelation because that that all that comes from the heart of God he already knows what it's going to look like she knows what's gonna happen so he chose you to be here to be a part say Amen that word means so be yet might as well say it gonna happen there's no one on the earth in the earth around the earth say it's round I gotta say that the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so that's him say the earth is round not flat they don't have edges you may say that property does not have edges there you go Holy Spirit truck can we use proper grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it there is a whole group of people that sincerely spend so much time and money to try to prove the earth is flat I'd rather use that money in that time and energy ruling right I've flown many times and I didn't get halfway around the world then all of a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait shh now you're on the other side no I went around besides I've already been up over the earth it's round God made it round he says he sits on the circle of the earth not the square you'd be surprised how serious they are they think NASA has spent billions of dollars faking it and none of that stuff is real I don't know who got that thought but it didn't come from heaven a man so just rest assured that it's around okay been there seen that it is round and when I almost shown it God caught me up in space up and do like like first space not I've been way up there but the first time he caught me up and showed me the earth he put a grid you know like a grid you know what that is yeah a grid was round and he put it right on the earth cheol-ho together and then they begin to draw things on this grid that was his plan that was called space planning that was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out in space put the grid than planned right uses every opportunity to be funny so he did show me his space planning for like the next hundred years that was probably 15 20 years ago when he showed me that that doesn't mean the earth is going to end in a hundred years except been taken further than that and no tribulation had happened I know some people think it's supposed to be right now well if it was it would be people get to heaven they all find out man we wasted so much time sitting on our rapture rug she to roll it up put it in the closet well you've you've been around a long time you realize I went to church everyday it was open and every day someone said Jesus could come tomorrow and in my I'm like little this is like little I had these thoughts why would he have all these plans in the Bible and go okay not forget that we're just all going home I mean he gave my dad a long plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him a long plan I mean he's not going to where we haven't done what God told us to do yet and God said well many people are in fear and they know one day that will happen so they want it to come so to them that's logical they don't understand a lot especially in the book of Revelation say revelations means revelations that means something you don't know so God said I'm calling you a Revelator me you know why he did that so people couldn't call me a false prophet they don't know what a Revelator is so they didn't never say nothing against it they couldn't say well she's not a terrible pastor no he can't call an evangelist she doesn't go out and win lots of millions we can't call her that huh can't call her prophet she's a Revelator don't know what that is so we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is someone who reveals like John did caught up showing the future the future no know what that was that was a bling glitch write that down and don't forget it I know Jen is writing it down right now if I say word she goes you did a bling glitch that means you blended some words together okay I won't explain it yes you've been there I'm sure people been there right you've been there well at least I'm not talking about noses putting the animals on the art tonight that's Moses and Noah doing it together when Donna even said Adam did it I did hear from people I have a bloopers thing one day and just put them all on there go there and look at it but now I forget we're talking about who is listening Revelator you're right so see I hear them all the time I have to fight when you're eight you need help so he didn't pick me to be a professor you know I was graduated middle of my class like literally middle we had six hundred graduating students we have a lot of people coming to Florida to go to school I guess they like it we're pretty laid-back there you know and so it's a nice place to live if you want to come live someplace different go good vacation time try not to come in August really hot so being a Revelator's a little bit different that usually doesn't mean profit just so you've wondered you know John was a men and it's okay I love doing that but I love being with my father my heavenly father him all the time I know why Jesus loved him so much I know why he wanted to be with him I know why he went away to the mountain to spend time with him I know how hard it was for him to leave home and come here okay he was not poor he didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor he became poor when he left heaven because heaven is certainly not poor there's nothing poor up there nothing splendor and wandering beauty you couldn't afford to build the house that you're mentioned that your mother lives in you wouldn't even have the right substances to make it the walls sing literally they sing they leave you go on tours come back they sing hello to them the trees uproot their self and they come and sit in your house and be your friend for a while they'll go back to the friendly forest is this ok it's not gonna be normal no you can't be normal you've been going to heaven for 20 years you be normal to heaven they tell funny stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped most people when they go there no matter how they were here they're all happy they love jokes they love to tell funny stories hear funny stories they love it they make plans for people before they come they knew Paul was coming they all knew Paul is coming there's a place you go in heaven where you find that out and you go in this beautiful amazing building and these supernatural monitors much better than ours but these are good and you can see who's coming home who's about to come home to heaven everybody starts getting things ready they're so excited they're there beside their self they want to make sure they're all there say all to meet you at the gate they have a huge celebration they plan one themselves heaven plans one the throne room plans one people have celebrations in the street over someone coming home stay home it's because that's where you came from we were alone to the earth for a while when you go home you are really home and you're not dead they don't throw parties for people who aren't alive they have huge celebrations lots of music lots of food everyone meeting one another visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't taking you himself sometimes he does take people he comes into his own chariot flaming horses picks you up and takes you up to heaven then when you get out you see the sea or the mass of people waiting to greet you and then Jesus walks you up the steps of the throne to give you back to the Father and then the father reaches out of that glory that moves in and out of him the Living colors of the bow coming in and out his eyes flames of fire passion for you just glowing and he reaches his arms out and grabs you he says welcome home my son welcome home my daughter you go home as his children say we are his offspring every morning gets their own mansion you don't have to share it with your brother or sister I'll have my own one day it's made exactly the way you would love it but it's made with his presence in the walls and the floors and it's not gonna be a normal shape trust me it's not all your pets to be there they'll be waiting to greet you eating your food at your table your family members will all have gifts for you for every year you've been apart they will get a gift that represents that year and put it in your mansion after your welcome home party in the throne room which could last for quite a while your family will come get you and take you to your own mansion then they'll have another celebration everybody laughs and filled with joy to see all the ones they loved before little tiny babies they never got to raise they get their children given to them to raise the same one that you that didn't make it all the way through amen God keeps them they live with your grandparents or whoever when they get there they'll go get them and help raise them for a while I love the story of a mother they lost their son he was either 7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of course they they grieved over him but knew he was in heaven and I think it was like 20 years later or 30 years later one of the other huh she died on the operating table and was caught up to heaven saw her seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom you're here this is so exciting your mom I'm so glad you're here and you cuz what have you been doing goes I've been playing with my friends what you think I've been doing he's been living with his grandfather and playing with all these friends and the streets to go they were playing and he was laughing and he said but you can't come yet because it's not your time and so she came back never forgot it and her and her husband went around the world talking about it you will be known as you are known except you look better like a whole lot better you'll have hair most guys wear their hair about down to their shoulders don't have you know that's gonna change y'all I'm just letting you know I can't change guys unless you really want like a buzz cut or something no Marine Corps or my husband may still have one I would might be surprised to see him alive yeah he's still with me by the way another way to kill me but that was okay it's all worth everything it's worth it all no matter what you surrender give up miss doing it's worth it and you'll be so happy when you stand before God and you're welcomed home knowing that you gave everything you could not saying you have to walk around poor okay that was the devil's plan not God's his plan is to bless us say bless us and prosper us it'll be worth it some people have already seen Jesus here right how many people have seen Jesus let me see either in a vision or dream or in reality if you've seen him how many people have been encountered an angel there's usually a lot there's a lot of people here it's going to happen that's part of the acceleration that's part of the more it's a lot of them more actually that we will see angels and they will probably be talking to us they came from God ignore what we've all been told our whole lives don't talk to angels they did in the Bible amen there's gonna be a lot more of that angelic not just visitation because what we're going to experience is the habitation heavens not coming for a visit a heaven is not coming for a visit they're coming for a habitation you're part of the habitation you are all of you sitting here say I'm alive and breathing I'm part of the habitation but God is about to do on this earth does not just take a territory here and there what the habitation will be is in us say in us that's the part of the habitation that's why me and won't be able to control it like they have in the past say God will be in charge it's a habitation and it will remain for a long time he's gonna transform this world right now he is shifting government so he can shape Nations it's part of the platform he's giving us in the habitation he's got platforms for us that's the place that we will operate from and speak from shake things cause things to be released to change for him it's not a lot of how it's always been in the past that's why it's a new thing say a new thing it's time for the new thing it's where we will be ruling it's one of the purposes that Christ died for us that's why he went into hell and wasted it took back the authority and Dominion the Adam had given away he gave it to us he also gave his power over all the power of the enemy say we have power over all the power of the enemy say he did not give that to the Angels that's why we need to command them they can't just go tear up any demon they see they just can't do that they do it in in the past it was from answers to prayer and prayers never going to go away it's never gonna go away he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's gonna get even more powerful especially when you command part of an army of heaven and they pull down strongholds for you and crush the plains of darkness we need this say we need it to rule in this day say every King gets the Kingdom and gets an army if we're part of the kingdom we get part of the army did you ever see a king a natural King on this earth title rule with that one they wouldn't go very far with a they'd be overrun beaten up things stolen things killed someone's like the devil he comes to kill steal and destroy that's what the army prevents heavens army was designed created and made every one of them unique and different but they are fierce they have one job the ones under Gabriel have many different jobs many different positions to do many different things but but Michael is over one specific part and that is the army they have a headquarters they have barracks they have training fields they're all in the sky of heaven Rand maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus would go send up Michael to gather the army from the far ends of heaven to fight on behalf of Israel people say Amen it's in the Bible go read it sometimes they even fought the flesh did you know that yeah some of them could fight the flesh in this time on earth it's mostly battles in the spirit battling the demonic even those in the high places the principalities and the powers the things the beings in wickedness in high places many of those high places will be shredded and pulled down say our weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds that's one of the things the army does I can only share what I have been told and I can only tell you what I have been shown shown and told that's what I talk about but they didn't just show me things and tell me things I had to live it every way something mom is trained in it was for the body of Christ so I had to live it to let you know it's real and it really does work she follow heavens protocol see on earth as it is in heaven that's what we've been asking for for generations we should have expected it jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told me is it I knew if I taught them that and said you say that eventually it would come you mean one thing I could get them to agree on no matter what denomination they rod to clear that prayer because they need us to call things in is that right you have not because you ask not if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give you anything you want no matter what it is where it is what time it is I give you permission to use me as anyone ever says something like that let me see your hands well I'll get ready because he's calling in those words yes it's gonna be amazing say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna be amazing here we can live on earth like they live in heaven which is mainly his will being done his way say his way not our way that's part of the more she's gonna do new thing he goes revelation and then ways for you to use that revelation it means a lot of things are gonna change so if you're stuck in your own mind or your own mindset of what you think is gonna happen and because it didn't it's not going to you need to just so that away because he does have a timeline in his own throne room and those dots on that timeline is when his things are going to happen regardless of what anybody on the earth is doing it's his sovereign will and what right now this time we're in it's on his timeline it is many of the generals are going home doesn't mean they'll be oblivious to what we're doing that means they'll know all about it after they get there and the thing they'll be celebrating is us who are still down here being a part of it so God really needs us right now he's intimidating me although I probably would have never chosen except when he asked me I said yes say it's important to say yes to being chosen many are called but few are chosen because they don't choose that's why many aren't chosen he can't make you do it right you're called you're being called but he can't make you do that you have to choose yes and when you do that you're saying yes I want to be chosen and then you're chosen what does it take to be chosen say choose yes then you got to be willing he makes it a little bit you know gotta be willing and obedient say willing obedience next say surrender is not control a lot of people think it is because you know God does have he does have I'm trying to think of the natural earthward it's like not there he does have guidelines is that right even Jesus had them that he operated by Jesus didn't just pick things on his own all the time where did he say I do yeah what his father said right but he showed him and what he told him that's what he did that's why we need revelation otherwise we're gonna get man's mind set on everything and that hasn't worked well has it he's not going to abandon the church I've heard all kinds of things when people's gonna abandon the church it's just gonna go away burn down we don't need it anymore let's get rid of it when he's not saying that to me he's going to set it on fire amen this is a time to be willing and obedient if you want to eat the fat of the land and Jesus did ask us to pray about one other thing pray that my people say we are his people be willing and the day of his power well obviously if he's going to give us revelation to operate like he does and part of that is power he says he'll give you power over all the part of the enemy there's one right there he's given us power and he does have power so if this is the day of his power the biggest thing the most important thing is remember the willing and obedient thing what he asked probably won't seem natural or normal to you wasn't natural normal to ask me to have pink hair I wasn't a pink haired person I liked it he wouldn't have asked me it's better than camel hair I like pink here any day over camel hair it smells it's stiff not comfortable and he had to wrap himself in it okay my pink hair is a test it divides asunder the Spirit from the flesh so those who trash or bash it or in the flash are we still so walking the flash say no we're supposed to walk in the so people don't have to tell me if they're hearing their flesh or hearing their spirit it's the way they react to the pink care now people who like pink hair they think is amazing so the world must be passing their tests because they all love it that's amazing you look amazing what do you do I'm a spokesperson for haven't I've been there and then they all say the same thing they don't say you're liar your father's property was that they go what was it like what was it like is it beautiful is it amazing is it real is is God real is there a god and go oh yes there is a God and you lived inside of him before you came here okay that makes him interested not bashing amen try that next time you did live in him you moved in and out of him he was your very existence you had your very existence in him that's why he knew you that's why he saw you before he sent you here you're wonderfully and perfectly made your souls were the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's Revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well I'm missing that no Adam became a living Saint loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to God that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life it's probably one of the least talked about things in the church it's a soul growing up I always heard that it was bad and went but God made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with God and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your souls fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody you wound and hurt eunuch stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand I was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time I never usually know but I looked at my clock and I was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it look like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause her soul to prosper all the time and then they live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that where B means lib it's called divine health so I since I learned about the father taught me about that he said people can loose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you loose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can loose from your soul and he said I know most people buying the devil but the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talked about the loosing thing what are gonna do with the loosing key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of God to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about God will never be taken from you and so people I know you know if you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it I'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue in your anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all it comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to loose that's that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of God as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming home you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're gonna do some spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll be excited you mean leaving an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're gonna have some fire sent the Angels already outside waiting but they're gonna do that tomorrow night I did this recently where I mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time just darkening I want to say drops of it the fire of God is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our God is a consuming fire I'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of Christ send the fire I want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart I mean literally make sure your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with God the fire it burns it out then he puts him in selves in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from God two stones a fire I find a one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that Satan left on some other planet that was in a Bible and I already knew what they were so God made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they were inside God or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the River of Life that's in him the river flows out of him the gemstones flow out of him even the steps of the throne room have gemstones they flow out of heaven and become the crystal see is called the crystal see because there's gemstones in it not sand that's why it's cut crystal faceted gemstones they're all over heaven they all come from one place when the father and the firewood burn inside of him and Lucifer would step in and there's his holy mountain inside God say God is not a man he doesn't look the same inside that we do but we lived there that's why we like sparkly things way back in our way back in our spirit man we remember that we met we remember that there's something that connects when we look at something that's brilliant and beautiful gemstones represent the love of God his love his revelation upon this rock I know he said Peter was a rock when God says rock in the Bible he's talking about a gemstone you know that white rock that white rock rock or stone you're gonna get when you go home to heaven and there's a name under the only he and you know it's a white diamond it's not a River Rock every syllabus I ever saw showed a river rock when it talked about that that stone so inside his eternity you never see at the end there's no end inside of him no end and we ran up and down this mountain and we slid down the river of life and would jump on the stones of fire through the flames we lived in those flames you're about to get baptized with him it's amazing I don't even know what time it is I better check what time is it oh my my see gem she's at it you didn't finish talking about Ron McClellan remember I was at his service right and I can I come in with these books in his parents and grandparents are sitting on the front row I didn't know him so but I knew a couple people there at celebration Church they let me come in and I just was going to wait till everything was over and they were everybody with their line going by the casket and he had this bright yellow suit on I mean bright with his big white tie and and he had the biggest fro I've ever seen on a human they had to stick it down in the casket and as I was walking I was walking up I looked up I was trying not to laugh out loud because it was an open portal and he was watching his service and now this is a band right band in a van travelling telling jokes non-stop doing sock puppets you know crazy stuff he did crazy things in the van with the guys and his band was there and they were telling the funniest stories and every time they say something funny he would go like this is here we go so here I'm looking at the casket and then I look up there he was alive for now and there was a lot of funny stories right so I'm like this is just this crazy it was so much fun and so I went back sat down and then it came up when I gave out the books and I didn't know who his parents were I knew who his wife was and her mom dad were there and I gave them one and I didn't know that was his father sitting there so I was telling you know his wife this is a book about heaven I really think it a bless you and I started to turn away and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take an extra one so of course willing and obedient I had an extra one in a little bag wondering who was gonna give it to and he grabbed my arm II said did you say that book was about heaven I said yes I I've been there he says can I have that book and I said yes yes you can have and he goes well I'm Randstad well was then this was for you because I didn't know you were gonna be here but he told me to bring it so this is your book and a few months later I get a phone call it's always in the middle of night and it's his parents and they're undone they were so full of joy in celebration after reading about what heaven was like they already knew what their son would be doing having a band and he does have a man and it's called the other side of the story his heaven he went from story side be to the other side of the story that was his bayum but in the band angels were playing and singing with him because he said he wouldn't let anyone take the place of his band when they came to heaven which I told their band and so his parents called they were really excited about everything and and then I they gave me their daughter's phone number he and his sister were really close together and so I called and just spoke to her for a few minutes and and then about I don't know it was probably a year later she called me she goes today is my birthday my 30th birthday and I just wanted to know does my brother even remember me does he still think about me because we had planned a big celebration on this day we didn't know he'd go home so I while she's on the phone to me God caught me up to heaven and I saw her brother standing at a portal this goes sound wild but it didn't matter he was throwing Cheetos at her from the portal and he was singing the worst rendition of happy birthday I've ever heard and this is a guy who sings sent was singing for a living right like me and this that's awful that's awful and then God sends me back and I'm she's still going on the phone I said wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to you hey I don't know what you can think about this but I got to tell you what what I just saw in heaven I saw your brother and he was throwing Cheetos over the portal at you and she starts to yell and scream she goes that that's she said he even had a throw by he run by what do you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he had her fro to so he said his greatest thing to do was run through the room and throw as many Cheetos in her fro that would stick there and she said he did it all the time and I was so irritated but now it's the most precious thing in the world that you told me that because I know he didn't forget me this is on her birthday remember and I said oh I don't know how to tell you this but he he sounded the worst I have ever heard for someone who's anointed to sing she said was it the worst happy birthday you ever heard in your life I want ya she said he did that every year too so she was so blessed to find out she that he had not changed he still remembered her he was still himself and she was so blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen I finished the story I'm done with okay so I want to encourage you to understand that your family still loves you no one has forgotten you they're making plans for you in this little vapor of time that we're in right now on this earth use it powerfully to love to forgive and to be willing and obedient understand John his last message loved one another that should be the thing we do the most amen don't forget to love if you get a choice forgive people who are bashing you when you do that it really does wound the demons and it is our time to torment the Nieman's say it's our honor and privilege to torment the demons those demons ask Jesus have you come to torment just before our time that meant that was going to be a time when they would be tormented is that right but he didn't do that he gave us power right so stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul is still enjoying his celebration party it goes on for quite a while I know that has something spent planned for him for anyone who ever wanders he made it no matter what you thought about his life or consider for him he loved God he had Christ in his heart he made mistakes he repented for them amen and he's highly honored and recognized in heaven for what he did for God and they're happy to have him home and so is his mom amen so let's make a declaration I love to make declarations say father thank you for timing my birth on the earth for right now I expect to receive the more to live in the more to be the more it is my commission I'm saying yes right now I want to be chosen help me to be willing and obedient and laugh while I do it I asked for and receive lots of fun I need fun heaven has fun on earth as it is in heaven I want to be dangerous against hell the enemy is my doormat but I am a ruler with Jesus Christ I am royalty I am your son or daughter this is the time I've been waiting for amen amen sit down do people have children here okay yeah I don't want to run too late that I don't get to lay hands on them if you have children so maybe in a few minutes I don't know what time do they pick them up okay wherever they are okay yeah I really want you given I know I'm gonna do an impartation tomorrow night I really would like to do one tonight I [Applause] think instead of talking for another 45 minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm probably getting the lightning power God last time I did it John G showed up that's who I call John G Lake he did he came and stood right next to me other seers saw him it was really zap BAM time but tonight I really want to give out a measure of the fire amen I've had a measure of baptism and fire and let me tell you I've not ever been the same so I want you to take it home with you let it burn on the inside of you don't let the fire go out what you're really doing is preparing a place for more to come say more say when I receive some of something from God I can have more I know there's major things that are about to happen in your lives shifts because this is the time to shift there's a lot of shifts the other thing is suddenly those are two different things a suddenly comes when you least expect it but just one suddenly can change your life it will fill you so full of faith when God moves his hand for you it's always a good thing say suddenly are good things because God is preparing you to receive more of him amen suddenly just send you over the edge probably about half the time suddenly czar about finances or wealth like a lot not like wow someone gave me a hundred dollars like a lot we've had quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm asking God to give you some of those also amen so when I when I heart fire to you I'm gonna add suddenly okay say I want the Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting ready for them I'm serious I really wanted God I'm a suddenly son or daughter so send it there you go now you set yourself up so I just want to get ready to lay hands on people it doesn't matter how old you are you can have a suddenly and you can also have the fiery men I see some kids running around they're gonna be fierce I'm talking about children yeah I have several grandchildren that already are fierce so I expect them to be fierce amen say fierce is a good word in this more time of God it's passionate remember the word says we take it by force so don't do don't be mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to take it by force amen in the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and encourages for us to be fierce amen and dangerous and violent say violence in the spirit realm is a good thing when we have it that word suffers does not mean that heavens being beat up by somebody however back to the translations God said go read some of the translations and see how they have translated or interpreted that verse from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take up by force and it literally said people are running into heaven and stealing things I don't know where they got that heaven is under attack no I don't believe that for a second it's us who are supposed to be violently passionate against the enemy and we had the right to take back whatever he has taken from us because he had no right to it Amen I love giving revelation in the word - it actually makes sense amen training up your child and the gift God put in them whether it's a drummer or a baker or an interior designer in the never depart from that gift because they'll be doing the thing they love the most that word in there says train up a child in the Ben or the way he made them that means who he sent you as what gift he made you and sent you here every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights and God said everybody sits on the few of the chair every Sunday trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is but one of the most important gifts he gave you is your natural gift your passion what you love what he made you to be or do in this earth that's not your job it's the thing you're the most passionate about you know your child is a drummer if they beat everything everything they have they beat on the table with it you know straw spoons forks whatever it is you buy them a farm you know the farm is set for Christmas and they pick them up and start beating on something with them the cow and the horse here they go take them in a restaurant they use the straws take them outside so they'll be quiet and then they break branches off the bush and start drumming with the bush say I think they're a drummer so raise them up as a drummer and they'll never run around the world trying to figure out who they are does that scripture make sense it's a revelation that's how important your natural gift is because when you go to heaven he plans to use it it's irrevocable you meant to be a baker make the best brownies or whatever it is you make everybody in the neighborhood loves them that everybody tells you to sell them when you go home to heaven you're going to make that and everybody will have it for free and everybody will love you they have rodeos amusement parks because people have gifts that do that is that right that's why we have fun in heaven and it's so natural they walk in heaven and here's all the stuff they need to design and to put together something that won't take forever to make it you're gonna be a baker as part of your mansion you have a full out kitchen with supernatural devices to use and all the supplies you need and then out in the front you have a bakery where everybody comes body your stuff Jesus will visit you regularly he has a sweet tooth that's why he liked honeycomb remember we served on the beach to his disciples remember he served him a meal he gave them what fish and say honey when it is cousin eat locusts and it ran in the family say I'm in the family now I know why I have a sweet tooth amen okay we're going to we're going to do this amen so I guess you can get people organized unless I tell everybody to come one row at a time and I'm gonna come down here you're gonna walk up to me I'm gonna just zap you with the fire God and then what do you want them to do next you want him to come and sit yeah Margaret stone I couldn't do this without mark or actually my team really I have a team I have like 15 people now I don't do this by myself amen every now and then I go okay I'm sending you this time you get up on the platform and speak and so I really do bless my team God gave me man using teams in this time the day the lone ranger is coming to a close amen we're going to need each other we're gonna work together amen and so I'm gonna give this microphone to somebody and then we'll come down here and lay hands on you don't forget to come tomorrow night it's gonna be amazing exciting walk sideways you'll never fall and then I'm gonna declare of declare our blessing over you when we're when we're done okay unless I should do it first because I don't know what you want them to do next do the blessing first that would be really wise because some of you may not be walking hold your hands Oh father I ask you as your daughter that loves you forever and you love everyone here it is your heart to bless to inspire to empower to get ready for some of the greatest days this earth will ever experience I'm asking you from my heart to theirs to bless them abundantly

and healings divine health everyone say I receive it I want them to have that on top of whatever measure the fire you want to give them God let them begin to burn for you don't drive if it happens I mean in the middle of the night sometimes it comes we've had people call us what am I gonna do enjoy it but I'm burning I've been in the shower five times and I'm still burning with let it burn it's
