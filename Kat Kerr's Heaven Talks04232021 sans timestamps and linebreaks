[Applause] if you see me making hand motions i'm copying the angels in the room they never are stagnant they're always moving they're always moving and so they really loved anything that worships the lord every time they go wild leaving in the throne room when when you're worshiping or adoring jesus christ just for a while but a lot of them they were going like this well most of them were going like this except the ones behind her one behind her was going so i have to call you when i'm watching it's hard not to do it the throne room is a powerful powerful place it is so amazing to have been there and the seraphim when the seraphim starts singing they come out of the glory cloud over the throne and their hair is on fire it's like blue fire and they sing and they sing and they sing and they sing i keep inviting them to come so if they ever showed them though your hair probably turned blue and catch on fire there's some of the fire carriers in the throne room but to be there on purpose there's nothing like no one is up there crying that they died as hard as that might seem to you to imagine they're not no one's crying no one is sad no one is grieving no one remembers anything bad that rhyme that wasn't me his holy spirit they they don't they're so in the glory really and that thing about for all of sin that comes short of the glory of god it's not about you committing sins i hear that you know if they don't have revelation they don't understand what that means that means you you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying the glory you should be carrying it for him releasing it for him it comes out of you like shockwaves begin to permeate everything it touches every person every place we we we don't do that we don't know how to do that it's something we'll do now in this time you are in one of the most important times on the face of the earth one of the most blessed times regardless of what your i see your ears here no you were chosen from the beginning of time to be here you were meant to be here all of your family members are so excited you're here amen you're not looking at the mass you're not looking at the virus which is you know pretty much gonna be taken off the face of the earth by god it's being used against everybody it really is i'm not saying it's not there i'm not saying it hasn't touched some people but it's nothing like what they're saying it is you need to know the truth i bring the truth i have to speak the truth okay all of this that you're living in now will be like dust in a very short time acceleration in this world and not just america this whole thing is yes it's here we know it's here uh we we talk about it we share what do we do but let me tell you it's worldwide what god is going to do he he is planning and his plan will take place it will say it will say god's will god's way not man's way not the enemy's way it will be god's way this country will be known by the glory of god the presence of god and he's setting it up you yes to understand there's covert operations in heaven and there's covert operations on earth and maybe you don't know all that but yes things are happening you cannot see but you will see them suddenly say suddenly it will all be known say everything will be known all the stuff about the elections will be known [Applause] and we will celebrate [Applause] and i know wonderful people talk about revivals a lot of people talk about moves of god a revival is kind of i don't want to say stagnant but it's kind of centralized in certain places what's coming isn't going to be centralized moves of god will come together to create one thing and that is called a habitation say habitation is what is coming it can't be controlled it can't be stopped and it can't be changed it's coming from heaven and we will be the habitation no one can move us or take us from the place god puts us so no matter how people are putting it what really is coming is a habitation of god yes that has never happened before on the face of the earth and you will not just get delivered you'll get to share it you get to experience it you get to carry it say carry it say the knowledge of the glory will happen because we will carry that glory all over this world so don't think of yourself of being left out okay that's not possible say if i'm alive and breathing i'm part of it that's how it's gonna be this time amen amen say for generations step out of your box and just say it for generations until god is done the boy will grow and build and cover the whole earth like the waters cover the sea the world will know there is a god and they better decide amen the other thing that i know is truth we can all say this together nothing that was done through cheating stealing lying unjust accusations will not escape being brought to justice [Applause] and let me tell you the god side knows a whole lot that's been going on that maybe you don't know and i am talking about trump that's okay if you're not okay come outside we'll get you saved and you know the person who likes him the least is the devil truly the one who's most terrified of him of trump is the devil say the devil doesn't like him maybe i should one of the few presidents who has said to the people i'm here to give your country back to you and i'm here to welcome jesus back into the white house he wasn't always perfect everyone knows that especially the fake news but they're stuck on it they all they do is hit replay and i've traveled all over the world when all that stuff started people were what's wrong with your news i want nothing not my news and not my news by the way you'd be better off not listening to anybody okay they know that they can brainwash you they know that they can compromise your soul to believe exactly what they're saying and that's why they keep saying it if you've never heard things about people that have gotten brainwashed that's how they do it they get you in a place so you will believe what they're saying then they'll say it over and over and over and guess what's going to come out of your soul say as a man thinketh in his heart that's his soul so is he that's what's happened to all of them their souls have been compromised they know it okay the darkness knows it all the others who are part of all that mess they all know that and that's why they keep it going that's why they don't want the truth to be known that's why they don't want us saying anything that's why they block you or be in you whatever they're doing they're so terrified that people will hear the truth and begin to believe it they don't want them i know i know i have i have really close friends who just did that they fed on it they're not the same people they're not the same people that's why every now and then anyway free soul checkup and i offer help to all those out there who have been compromised lose it from your soul and i'm really serious about that he made us that we can loose things remember the keys of the kingdom what you loose on earth will be loose from heaven what you bind on earth can be bound on him loose all the bad all the negative all the hurt trauma tragedies all of the fear all the fake news every word you've ever heard lose it all from your soul heaven will come down and pull it out and they really do that they will do that i've seen people change in three minutes from doing that then then you bind the things of god i choose my will to find the life of god the love of god the presence of god his will his way his word i find the truth to my soul and there is no one on the earth that can take it out of you that's what they need to heal the world actually needs a soul checkup right so it's not that hard to be free it's not number one you have to know that you're not you need to know when you've been deceived because the devil for eons and ages always use fear as his number one weapon now it's deception it really is because when you say yes to deception you're deceived and when you're deceived you can't see the truth understand the truth or even want to know the truth so this whole country and other people all over the world i always do those soul checkups if you hear me doing it that's why i'm doing it i want them to be free right that's right and after the first election i offered it free to all the democrats a post-election therapy i called it to have your soul set free and a lot of people did it and i have that a lot of people call me contact let me play says hey i did that i'm free we will get some new networks i promise you the truth is some of them will close and be shut down we'll keep on with the truth okay from the justice that's coming some of them will lose their network and you don't even know this but some ceos have already started stepping down the thing about deception is when you aren't deceived and you willingly knowingly do what's wrong and you know commit crime you're quite aware that it just might not work yeah so this whole thing that they're doing when they see isn't working they just put more barbed wire around them he's not god they can't stop god i'm not going to stop god so i also knew this that when these things the landslide starts can't stop it that's called justice amen a lot of them will try to run some may end their life we need to pray for those people because they don't want they don't want what that word was saying up there about the shame they didn't want people to know what they were doing but everyone's going to know what everybody was doing because it's already been collected amen and so they they have proof all the proof they need and i will just mention this for those who don't know this is a truth meeting how about that this is the truth the truth is that they've already been uh tried in a different kind of a court and been found um guilty and uh in case you didn't know uh trump is actually a president i just say that he did win he wants anyone they tried to steal it it's not going to work [Music] and the crazy thing in all this is they're trying they when i say they i mean the left delivers whatever you want to call them they god calls me villains i'll just say what he does the villains we're hoping we would just give up and do what they wanted they forgot one thing we we the people do not a third world country where we are in control say we are free and we're staying free man that made a big mistake and one thing he didn't consider that we wouldn't don't all dumb goblin has happened no they're not smart because we run closer to him we get closer to him we hear him clear we become more dangerous against hell that's what happens when you press on god's people that's exactly what happened so mistake number one was that you thought everybody would just dump god and give him up they don't know us say they don't know us they're about to find out amen [Music] so that was their first mistake the second mistake is we're already free we live free say we're free right now we aren't bound get anything to villains has written down his new laws and i have to say this to you because the father said this to him he said tell them this please it says when the righteous are in power the people rejoice so why don't you rejoice because the truth is the humans have no power they are not in power say the villains are not in power the righteous are in power so we're going to keep rejoicing while they remove the others the best show on earth jesus christ wiping out hell these are going to be glorious days and i am so excited to be here okay i got born again i i came out born again i think i do remember at age four receiving christ and because i'm a senior i saw him step inside of me you can't tell a child is four years old that he's not real and that doesn't really happen you're really more open to it than most people when they get older it's a little bit harder because your mind gets in the way i saw him step inside of me i liked it so much when i turned five for my birthday i did it all over again this is how precious jesus he stepped out to step back in [Music] for a birthday present so living life with heaven all the time is definitely different i tell people all the time i'm i'm like an eight-year-old if you pick on me you're picking on nate road they forget it really soon right they see a pretty flower a crawling bug or a piece of cake and they forget it so he really did i i worked with ceos most of the time i was i love business i'm a business person actually i'm a ceo hey this is how we dress when you get in here and having your ceo right they're the best apparel ever you don't get a nightgown in the bathrobe and having people i hope you didn't not for the one who owns everything he's not going to give you that that's not what people wear up there you have an apparel wardrobe room it's like a thousand square feet maybe more than that and every kind of beautiful amazing thing because there's so many things to do in heaven you can't ride a roller coaster in a gown in case you wonder i wouldn't try it for so long i grew up in the church trust me from the day i was born i was in church and i was there for every revival every special visitor it didn't matter if it lasted six weeks i was there every night for six weeks along with all my siblings and my parents would space the older ones in between the younger ones you know when you got 15 i mean several people i was i was an adult at age eight that's why he kept me video see i earned it because from that age i had to help take care of my 12 of my siblings everyone was a chief okay they were all in charge all highly anointed uh you know they they needed to be tempered a whole lot they practiced on me and from a very young age i could see in the spirit room i understood it being the father son holy spirit i remember when i invited the holy spirit he came inside me like a whirlwind and he's been there ever since and i can tell you how that happens who wants to know how he can be everywhere at the same time anybody want to know he has unlimited layers of himself one of the key words in heaven is layers there's layers of everything layers of space you can have like 10 places on your space your one mansion's on and it's hard to explain except when they teach me how to say it you can see it and so on your mansion let's say you have a city i've seen some people's mansions the size of new york city so maybe you better expand your thinking say expand that and on your management property there are these doors suspended just above the ground a beautiful door different colors different doors like around your or your whole property where your actual mansion is sitting on whether it's in the middle of the crystal sea under the crystal sea on top of the mountain spices in the valley of the falls uh wherever it is that he puts it uh on that property will be doors and if if you open the door you can see the other space that yours with places in there that are yours you can walk around the door like i could walk around this this is how there's no limit to space in heaven here's the door let's pretend this is the door you can walk around the door you see the door right you see it you can walk around it's just this but if you open the door you step into another whole area that belongs to you that could be in the valley of the falls the mansion out here is maybe on the beach of the crystal sea or the mountain spices so you get many he said what do you say i go to repair a place for you in my father's house a world not a flat place in the sky are many mansions i go there to prepare a place for you so he's not going to tell you any more than that oh until you get there and then you find out really how magnificent and amazing he is there's so many things adventure excitement intensity a joy humor all of that is in heaven that's why we have it here say it was there first it trickled down to here they have mountains they have valleys they have oceans you can ride a 200 foot wave and not die when you crash off of your board because you haven't done enough times up there the waves can change direction while you're on them okay they can open up they can swing you back and forth is heaven it says eyes have not seen your ear heard or entered in the heart or mind of man but he has prepared for you except and unless is revealed by the spirit of god i stand on that scripture for every time they've taken me every time they've shown me i can stand on that because of that i can see i can know and i can't understand and that's my commission my commission is to reveal heaven to this earth that's why i go all the time non-stop they have not stopped since 1996 taking me i used to try to count gave that up pretty soon and guess what when does he do it whenever he wants to why i gave him permission you have my permission to do with me whatever you want if you ever said that you better watch out because these are the days of the glorious signs and wonders that manifested signs with through the daughters and sons of god on the earth those aren't other beings who are going to come here and have it yes you say it's us we're your sons and daughters we'll manifest and demonstrate [Applause] hearing things and uh seeing things you never saw before and don't worry when he tells you you're going to hear him how does he do that uh step up and do that step out go up to the front of the funeral and raise the dead that was cremated [Music] [Applause] that happened a few times maybe facebook won't block it that's probably going to be replaced also by the way yeah they'll just be replaced and you know they didn't really do all that until guess who started running for office because he's a threat he said you can't be bought talk about trump again i don't mind insane it can't be bought can't be controlled they can't make him afraid and he already knows the truth so they can't convince him to lie they can't even deceive him he knew all of them before this started happening because the wealthy and the rich are invited to everybody's inner circle whether the good or not they know he knew the corruption that's why he was willing to do it we don't know what they're lying out of their teeth i know what they're doing i know all the stuff they're involved in no hey yes i will run and they were afraid from the day he said that they tried everything we could of 17 people trying to get that spot on the republican ticket and god told me i will eliminate them one by one by one and they will be forced to put him there guess what happened they were forced to put him there amen i know even even through history there's always been people that nobody else would have picked but god and some of them were very colorful yeah but if anybody ever heard all the stuff that was said against him they would think he wasn't worth anything and yet right now he's very valuable to god if anybody likes it or not he will be leading all this stuff that's going to be happening and while we've been out here some people not maybe y'all people are afraid not knowing what their life is going to be like how's everything what about all these horrible things being made from the villains laugh that's what heaven is doing about it there probably was never anything on the papers just so you know that they didn't waste the time to do it they whatever they can get away with the food people they're doing this is to say this is truth we just can't be deceived amen and most of people i've talked to i start to start a conversation anywhere in the airport the grocery store i don't care where it is so what did you think about the elections see i used to say hey i voted for trump 90 of everyone i talked to by the way you voted for trump yeah they did and the ones that didn't don't even know what the other ones are doing up there right now i confronted one of those the other day in my own yard yeah my husband hired him to mow front yard and came to the back he should have never done that i was about there i was back there because we released a home from friends of ours who were pastors in new york so uh the guy was replacing the little fertilizer fertilizer see i can't even think that what are they called where's my husband where are they putting the ground those tubes to kill the bugs that come in to eat your house up terminator see my natural brain don't ask me a question heaven spirit round future past you know anything about god father son holy spirit the 12 you know what are they the 12 the 24 elders know i know all of them already oh the seven spirits of god aren't just his attributes those are seven spiritual beings in case you wonder oh yeah they are actually seven smooth the wednesdays so they're seven spiritual beings it's one of the images they use god sends them on special assignments i laugh when you hear cloak and dagger that's usually about you know murder mysteries but actually holy spirit wears a club all the time he loves to he wears one the seven spirits of god wear them that came from heaven that's not a hell thing hell stole too many things okay say house deals because they can't create something new and so anyway so i was back there with a guy replacing those termite tubes and i said the same thing hey so uh he's up say he's a millennial too i said so what did you think about the elections i think they were stolen yes they were still on the lousy themselves they're all villains i want you to say what god calls them and then comes around the corner the other guy so what do you think about the elections oh i think i am so glad they got someone in there the other one was such a rotten lousy guy oh you're talking about fighting right might as well say his name yeah now i'm talking about something so oh no no no no he is the good guy do you know what the other ones are doing do you even know what they're doing well i know they're doing good things for this country but you cannot watch one single thing that they said they're doing and you don't know that they want to let all the terrorists in the world here with no pulse bar did you know they want to break down the law so all those human trafficking people can come through and just gather more to take out and and you obviously don't know that they're going to wipe out church completely because they don't want god here and this guy guy had already said to me god bless you well that's who you believe then you don't need to know those people up there because god's not blessing now he's going to remove them oh i don't think that let's just end this really quick conversation i would tell you they have all the evidence if they had no no i'm not talking about civil civil evidence i'm talking about military tribunal evidence i'm talking videos i'm talking testimonies i'm talking things that have been taped that you would be so horrified to find out what they actually have been doing even before they started their what they knew who they connected to what they've been doing all around this world it's already there it's there and they have it these guys who are in there now faking who they think they are they will be wiped out and god will say exactly who our president is back there maybe not in that spot but he's going to play back he will still run this country he is president he doesn't have to be proven to be president he already has won he won the other guy over here going yes yay the termite guy and this guy was probably in his late 40s and this young guy knew more than he did he was he was very aware of what was going on you'd be surprised if you talked to how many people voted for the other guy don't know anything that they're doing because all they know is they hate the other one and that was their plan we will bring this i'm serious it's what they do in other countries they brainwash people to believe what they want to then they go do whatever they feel like that's how those people live that's how people live in venezuela and other countries they know what socialism and communism is and they don't want it this way they try to escape so they made a few announcements and the whole rest of their campaign on the left was how horrible he is and if you ask him why is he horrible well i don't know but he's just i can free you from that right now in your soul do you wanna then they run come over here i'll get rid of that of your soul you need to get that out of your shoulder you can live a normal life again and actually tomorrow's when i talk about america this is this commercial for tomorrow amen because heaven is celebrating everywhere right now they're celebrating because they do know what time it is on god's timeline and if people don't know this is i'm talking about pastors and i won't talk about pastors revenge as well okay evangelists kind of got it made because they're still going for the big harvest right now we're going to talk about the naked harvest we're going on with the big harvest that's what we're here for what no you should be a voice for truth no matter what else you do you should say the truth let people know where you stand with what god wants what god asks of us let life live let life live and don't take it amen and anyone who wants to take life you're already in a really hard spot but god if you voted for life to be taken from babies you are in trouble and i can honestly say that according to the word of god you're in trouble you are and one day you'll be falling on your face repenting when you find out the truth of what the other ones were doing continually amen so i gotta let go let's let go and set it back here somewhere up here because god is right now beginning to create that habitation and people need to know number one the world's not ending now i'm talking about heaven it's not over say it's not over i just the father says it's over not even jesus knows when it's over and i have new spheres not coming for a church that is fighting each other angry at each other despising each other spitting on each other shall i continue coming for a church and a bride who has no sin and no flesh showing up in flesh and fleshy fighting it is what the spiritual mind is life refreshing mind it is he said i offer you life and death what do you say to choose my life a lot of people miss that this time around because life is what you're going to get everybody's going to get life even the ones who didn't want it it's going to come it's not going to stop from coming and he knows his timing he has a timeline around his behind his own throne his throne is in the middle of the throne room it's not on the back wall and you'd always seen these paintings there's god on his throne and there's millions of people all over here who can't get to him he didn't ever do that it's in the middle when four sets of steps and people run up there all the time all the time if you make it to heaven you're going to get to see god okay you get to see father you get to see jesus i never understood these people that said there's levels you have to get you after you get up there no the bible doesn't say does that no no it says the pure in heart shall see god amen and that means it can be now once you get born again or when you go to heaven people need to get over that no one can see the face of god and live oh trust me everything within you that was wrong would die instantly if you saw him but the bible clearly says the pure heart shall see god right so guess what i see him i see him i see jesus christ i didn't see the invisible spirit of god i see the outline of his person usually fires going around him or whirlwinds of the rainbow or going around him but i see him he's big and he is called the drama king in heaven well he sure creates drama every time he touches the earth doesn't he they were not suspecting him back in the day when he fell and began to do things that people were spinning and jumping over furniture and they really were doing crazy wild things way back they didn't even know what they didn't really know what they had they just knew it felt good we should be well acquainted with it he is my best friend and he speaks to me all the time guess what he's always speaking always say always are you hearing him you're hearing but maybe we need to unclutter our soul the more stuff you get in the layers you are a later being holy spirit as unlimited layers thank you holy spirit for reminding me i was supposed to talk about that see i told you you don't smell the time holy spirit is very powerful being he's still with celebration and joy drama excitement that's him if there's enough roar in heaven holy spirit there then i get corrected doctrinally i thought he moved to the earth why don't you have a conversation with him i'll let you talk to him about that and see what he says to you okay he has unlimited layers of himself so when he involves you you don't get a little piece you get a hold of him he takes a layer of himself and throws it in you that's how that happens unlimited layers that's how he can be everywhere all the same time all over the world know everything see everything hear everything you can invade any places he's invited to somebody's not invited to he's the most exciting single beings the most excited being in existence right now right now i see jesus can't come back right now the father's up there delegating through governmental stuff all the stuff that's going on right now on earth but the holy spirit well he didn't move his operations here that doctrinal person was right he did jesus said when i leave i will send who the holy spirit the comforter the one who will walk alongside hey walk alongside yeah unless you invite him in if you ever wonder what spiritual protocol is even in heaven you must invite okay you must invite i'll prove it you invited jesus christ right yes say yes he did we can take care of that right now [Music] you must invite jesus christ to be your savior repent of your sins invite him to come in this is all scriptural john 3 16 he will come into you he also has unlimited layers and he made you with unlimited layers of you everyone in here has layers that look just like you is this exciting yeah it should be it's the way you meet your soul your soul your emotions are all your layers the more emotional we are the more layers of you you have in you what does it do with those layers well when you get born again because you invited him right he takes one and he seats it in heavenly places and it's you it literally is it literally really truthfully is you it's a part of you it looks just like you still connected to your soul so all around your will let's say this is your will it's a strong column off of that from all these layers that look just like you but they move like they're living because they are this is a spiritual part of you not talking about your flesh your flesh suit is your flesh seep okay until it gets super glued together at the end that's glorified when you're glorified that'll happen one day okay you don't get glorified in heaven you can glorify when your spirit person who moves to heaven while your body rests or if it's blown up or eaten by a shark or burnt up to nothing he knows where every cell and molecule of you is this is true because some people think you can't get cremated say it's cheaper say it's cheaper your family member was standing right here said why didn't you cremate me you would have saved money and god will still put everybody back together again one day because is he going to leave all the people who were burnt out somewhere no no you get your body back say yay he's going to look a whole lot better [Music] your spiritual bodies didn't turn you right now you go man i look good because guess what everyone says in heaven man you look good you look funny you look good too but they recognize you it says so in the bible it says you will be known that means your images you'll be known as you were known on the earth so people will know you everyone in heaven knows your first name everyone's going to want a hug say no masks in heaven no social distancing in heaven no handshakes in heaven they give up hugs father abraham will probably be the first one if you make it to the gate because sometimes your family members are waiting outside the gate when you come up to heaven there's a landing place you come no matter how they bring you in jesus's own chariot somebody's chariot a spaceship a world war ii biplane whatever people come in many different things whatever would delight you the most is how you're going to be taken some people step in the elevator and they just go they don't want to mess around they're the people with few layers in their soul okay they got five layers just taken young their angels stepped in this spiritual elevator they step in with the person and up they go and they're there they bypass going to see the whole galaxies and everything which he will take you to see if you want to so even leaving is an experience is a powerful experience but you have layers in you and he made you that way number one spirit soul and body shall we count them say spirits that's a layer body that's a layer soul that's a layer even your body has layers right the skin the muscles the bones you have layers there's no way you can deny that you have layers your spiritual layers are some of the most exciting so people who have a lot of emotions down here probably going to be magnified in heaven your personality gets magnified in heaven yes the jokes are better okay number one there's nothing defiling nothing breaking nothing evil nothing that anybody couldn't see the movies are all clean the jokes are clean stay clean it's heaven most exciting intense beautiful amazing that would wonder and splendor and creatures you've never even seen before are there but he made you layer for different reasons okay so when this layer that you're wearing right now sleeps or like i said it's melted down or whatever happens to it's going to be okay god got it okay he's got that thing so yeah make sure you get cremated it's cheaper i meant people said i'm on i want to give my family member a funeral but would have been seventy thousand dollars of what i had to create it for seven months they're probably happy you did that because guess what we're all going to be back say we'll all be back we get our bodies back they will be young they will be timeless timeless there's no time in heaven everyone is young time doesn't go by okay it comes from god time comes from the father he's in charge of time okay he does things in heaven by events say by events on god's timeline it's whatever event is on there is what's happening there's an event right now it's not send jesus to get the people on the rapture rug that's not what's on there that's way way down way away okay say beginning of time i could draw a timeline all the way down to here [Music] we still have all of this left at least several hundred years maybe more i might still be here amen y'all want to be here during all that time yes are you sure about that no i am i've not been given an option when i said yes to do this and my family knows they already know i'll be here when they're gone their kids are gone their grandkids are going the great friends i'll still be here i'll make them some brownies because he chose me for that and i said yes you know john could have still been here say john that beloved the one who jesus loved will be very scriptural could have remained and be here right now if he chose that god's not a respecter you just have to say yes and you have to be willing yes is nice willing is better willing and obedient is what he needs okay for people who have commissions like that and that's not even my gift my gift i as you look at me i am a photographer my passion that i'd rather do 24 hours a day if i could would be photography i create moments in time that's how i look at it i don't just take a picture there is no taking picture if you take pictures around me i will correct you hold the camera up get the light on it before you bring it down if you stand there you're gonna have a shadow and all those things are outlined when i travel and speak overseas people always want to take pictures what's got a picture of the castle all their 15 friends are lined up you see the top of the castle if i can help you please if you all will stand like this leave a space for the castle then like this you'll all be in it but you can see the castle because this is what you take a picture of right now so that's what i am i was sent from god in my soul photographer when i go to heaven i'll have my own studio please come it'll be for free which is a joke because nothing costs anything anyway i will for sure have a studio because i know whatever gift he made you is what you would do in heaven is what you love the most that's how heaven uprights that's why there's so many things to do in heaven does that make sense to your head well most people thought we would just be worshipping you never stop because when you see all the things he made for you you will worship in the middle of the street anywhere everywhere you start shouting praises to god because he remembered all the things that you love amen there'll be pictures of some of your family members in your mansion and right now they take pictures that you if you lost if they were burned up in a fighter they'll be in your mountain on the wall it's one of the things he does i know i saw somebody's mansion and i saw siblings they have right now and i saw other ones like probably maybe i don't know 10 11 12 something like that they weren't even born yet and i know how many siblings this other person will have so people's mountains will be quite a delight to you your crowning room is massive because you get more than one crown [Music] he gives them out say he gives them out at one time we will throw a specific one we're not going to throw all of them at him we bury him maybe i don't know it's okay to laugh you need to know that humor is one of the number one things in heaven there is peace people go well peace be with them they die don't even rest in the arms of jesus they're not resting [Music] they're riding a roller coaster they're eating desserts somewhere because jesus loves desserts honey was his number one thing he ate while he was on the earth and guess what his cousin ate it too right what did johnny where's the last thing say it loud his family was hooked on honey jesus loved honey we made that that feast for them on the shore fish and it was honey he loves honey guess what he still loves me i have a jar in my pantry that says this is for jesus if he shows up i'm ready and to make this whole thing even funnier people don't think they'll laugh sometimes you laugh or cry when i talk about it sometimes you just don't know what to say because your your natural brains like blanked out a long time ago it's going to be in the ground anyway or where else it ever is but but i was the person in the family of 15 who wanted to number one be alone in a family of 14 siblings i always wanted to be alone was that ever going to happen do you think it was ever going to be about me say no really loud i wanted to be alone and i didn't care if anybody knew who i was i don't know if they knew my name i didn't want to hug anyone i didn't want to hug anybody that won't be kissed don't go to italy unless you want to be kissed if you go to a meeting 500 people you're going to get a thousand kisses because they don't just kiss you once they kiss you on both cheeks kiss kiss kiss kiss by these 400 people they had four four meetings they're making so much for my life so i want to be alone right i didn't want to be hugged or kissed i didn't want anyone to know me i knew two people and all of the schools i attended all three of my schools i knew two people that was it i wasn't seeking for people i was never part of a clique i was probably better off i wasn't a part of any of the crimes and other stuff i never got into that stuff because number one remember i could see i saw the demons around it you didn't have to ask me what hell was involved in heaven was i could see it so i didn't want any of that so here i am just wanted to be left alone that that wasn't going to happen in my life first of all i had to give myself to my family i was always on my parents side that made you unpopular had 150 pets to take care of the person we learned in the bible was how to do a funeral we sent every one of our pets to heaven don't argue with me about that i saw them there like every pet we ever have is in heaven my dad has him on his ranch every time he's someone i hear these words from my father in heaven he gets another one that was my dad's favorite words it was whatever he said about anything he he eat gas he gave himself to the world he loved his enemies literally he loved his enemies it ticked him off he loved everybody dragged him in our house got him a bed on the floor somewhere fed them found them jobs got them clothes helped them get a house that was my dad's part in the world was to be the love of god my brother rj said he was meant to kill wicked people we only did one meeting if you never met my brother rj you should search for someone yeah my brother despises injustice if he ever was a warrior he's the warrior he is the word he lives out in the wilderness away from everybody so he doesn't kill you know half the harvest before they get saved but he won't take down people who call the police i found the criminal you've been looking forward such as there he is already dad but they all know him so you know he's not going to hurt anyone that that didn't deserve it that's what he says our one meeting began together he let me go first and i was just talking about the love of god in heaven and everything then he gives her that high i'm rjs she was uh she was created by god she loved people i'm created to kill him it's a wicked this is the funny thing we were in a block church because almost no white pastors that time would invite me i might tell you something they weren't threatened by me because you know their whole culture they already had heaven culture right yeah and i have a lot about 50 000 black friends i love them all right and they might guess what righteousness truth they want all that they do again the line drawing news that's what god calls him the lion crying news but anyway so that's what he said i'm created to kill people who would take her out or kill people who are wicked and evil and belong to the devil he gets locked on death row he's about my height to minister to people who are about to be taken out yeah and he won't not look down he will not look down most people won't even go there's like three levels of bars between you and the people he'll walk up to the closest bars he can get to put his face right there and stare a hole in him and he move his eyes he'll just sit there and then they'll go like this who do you serve i started the living god of heaven on earth you made you carried you before you he gave you commission said he earth to bring life to people not to hurt them you need to know jesus christ because i know what hell looks like too and you'll burn forever and you won't like it they don't know what to do with him right he goes and gets all these prisoners one to jesus christ he won't back down he's certainly not back now and i won't tell you what he wants to do to those people in the barbed wire in dc so my siblings are very different from each other i learned to love everybody no matter where you're from where you're at you know i can honestly say i love you because god in me loves you so our job here is to love to share the truth right you don't have to force people to get saved you can't do that anyway it has to be a decision in here right and make a decision we just water it you know and share and then water it somebody else water then somebody wins them to jesus christ holy spirit draws them say holy spirit draws them it would be much harder with that holy spirit on the earth okay that's why he was sent way back in jesus time it wasn't easy to live that either but easy to live in the beginning right after jesus left but it certainly is different now and you were made by god very specific when he sent you he wrote words on the will on your will wrote on your actual will sometimes i can see him on people's will because i'm a seer i see spiritual things he wrote words of what he wanted you to be what he created you to be in the earth that book she writes every day of your life in you're in a book that's there you get it when you go to heaven this is what he intended for you this is what he purposed for you but sometimes the enemy got you off track sometimes wicked people did things he didn't intent and he he that was not his purpose he created the earth so he could take you from him where you live and when the time of conception comes holy spirit takes your little spiritual being and knits you together to that dot of flesh that's i knit you together in your mother's womb that's not putting your arms and legs down this nobody on this earth can do this spiritual thing nobody can even know where your spiritual being is the spirit of life talked about the bible was you you wrote in and out on the rays of the rainbow from the father they still do send me i want to i want to love people to send me i want to go to earth for you they'll say that to the father all the time that's what you did you played in the river of life inside him he jumped on the stones and fired a massive gemstones burning with his passion that's where everyone here came from everyone who's on the earth came from that place the father carries you in him in him we live we move we have our being the prophets and poets of the old have spoken of these things that means they will show that it reveals them where they came from everyone no matter what they believe or where they're at right now in this world came from him he is our father we are his offspring his heart is that you know him that you love him that you receive his son so you can be with him in heaven because jesus is the way back to the father and when anyone dies and they are caught up to heaven jesus meets you he walks you up the steps of the throne and says to his father here i have brought them home to you is part of his reward for dying for us he knows everything about you still loves you still wants you has purpose for your life here this is the thing about the babies this is awesome every baby when every baby was sent he wrote on their wills and by the way he wrote whether they were male or female yeah some other group can't teach anybody that i know they'd like to do that too by the way they wrote that on some piece of paper somewhere he wrote in here and when people try to be some other thing that they're not they have great conflict in their soul their soul fights against them because their soul already knows if you're male or female let alone what your body is saying to you they know that's what they were meant to be and i have talked to many people who switched that and have switched back and would all tell me the same thing i had conflict all the time in my soul it would fight and say no that's not you that is not you that's not how you were made you're meant to be i will tell you this there is going to be in one of these of god millions of homosexuals will get born again like like in a sudden a way and if they had operations they get their stuff put back on yeah talk about a sign and a wonder right here he's going to do it he's going to do that because he made us very specifically he made us detailed our personalities are different your personality is still different in heaven you're just nicer if you weren't nice down here you laugh and control me and you won't get to stop it either this place isn't heaven they go just for the laughter okay waves of it come out of places and hit you and just roll on the ground you never did that get used to it practice maybe then i saw a spot i was one of those people that didn't laugh i was so serious i was serious serious with the capital s i was serious i was serious i wanted everything to be done right that was me you know when my mom knew she left me the house would still be burning and not be burnt down that i'd know where everybody was and they'd be okay they may not be happy with me but but that was my assignment to keep everybody together and keep them safe and i i made like 10 sandwiches every day for their lunch and helped them with homework at night then if i was they were sick i've got to pray for them and sit with them until they were better and this was my life this was my life like young my life and i didn't say no to my parents i honored my mother and my father i get to do this now i get to have pink hair which was ordered by heaven okay i get to eat cake i still have to watch how much i eat okay i celebrate all the time because i already know i know what my end is i also pretty much know what your end is and it's because i'm willing have been taken back in the past and shown how things happen so i can give revelation taken forward in the future i've had glimpses of the new earth and all the other worlds around it i've seen father son holy spirit seven spirits of god melchizedek who is the father's high priest and always has been he has always had flesh on him i'm going to really mess with your mind now now has always had flesh before god made flesh on people on the earth he's really neat looking he serves the father at the obedience of the father he came to the earth became the king of salem collected tithes from abraham that's why he could see him he's also the one who's oh head of the tribe of angels that there's a whole tribe of angels that god put flesh on so you can send them to the earth as watch your angels not all of them fell everybody says oh my god not all of them some did some did not they have flush that's why they can make offspring i hope your answers are getting given okay but melchizedek still serves the father that's his position personal high priest to the living god the seven spirits of god also serve god they serve him they are his that means they serve him that doesn't mean that they're his seven attributes everybody every syllabus i've ever seen okay seven spirits of god here's the syllabus and in five minutes i can tell you what it is okay how to explain the trinity some people can't they think we have a three-headed god no they have the ability to step inside of each other father you know son holy spirit holy spirit steps in the father jesus steps in the father here's the three in one and that's how he showed me helped up to heaven said i'm going to show you the three in one and they all came i said here we are father son holy spirit in a couple minutes of time if there was time i understood what people have tried to figure out for years when he said jesus said father me and you when you and me he literally meant me inside you and you inside me and when they began to create before there was anything there was heaven the father's house there's nothing but the spirits around the father would step up where there's nothing he would speak physical realm jesus stepped out of him he was called the word stepped out and a drop of water in his hand he stretched it into a canvas and he wrapped it around just like this a huge part of the spirit realm and we created the physical round and then he began to hang the planets on there anything visible he couldn't hang physical things on a spiritual thing that's why spirits can walk through this physical wall because the original realm supersedes this physical realm which is temporal that's how he did it and from that moment they began to create everything in the physical realm we created the planets they didn't make the sun in the moon yet because the first earth when he made it the first time was lit with his glory millions of years between verse one mercy millions millions say millions i hope that messes up your mind too you know who doesn't mess it up it doesn't mess up scientists they ask the uh i'm not going to say astrological the astronomy people already have an understanding that this earth is well well over millions and millions and millions and millions of years old those who dig in the dirt and find the dinosaurs and the layers of the earth they already understand that man man man has been here for a limited time but the earth itself has been here for a very very long time so when there's darkness covering the earth because of what happened before that right in the beginning means before there was time in the beginning was when the earth was just a thought in god's head when he made the earth it was perfect it was beautiful there was no sin in it he said to watch your angels to watch over all the creatures that were on the earth the dinosaurs roamed the earth there was a water vapor shield around the whole earth that put mist on the ears because it hadn't rained there had been no storms yet on the earth there was only one landmass and all this ocean was around it how do i know he took me back in time and showed me how he created the heavens and the earth and when i explain this to an evolutionist they want to know god because they have answers to the questions they've always had what about that footprint they found by the dinosaur that was a watcher angel who had flesh on him so his footprint was in the dirt there's no crow magnum man there were never there never was a chromatin a man okay god didn't make people that were half ape and half person and put them on the earth okay we are we didn't come from monkeys say we didn't come from monkeys say we're made in the image of god he's not a monkey the angels laugh every time they hear us every time they watch the slime pool thing every time they watch someone talk about the big bang they laugh so hard they would cry if they could [Music] because that takes a lot more faith to believe than god making us putting us here right so having this involved very much in our lives always has been involved the angels are all over in here they all your angels are here and most of mine are outside because they couldn't fit in here and god gave me promises all kinds of promises just said yes i'll do this for you however long it takes i don't care he said one day i'll open their eyes everybody will see the angels one day i'll take everybody to heaven so everybody raise always do this raise your hand up say we're ready right now take us for a trip let's see if it happens not today that may seem strange to some people but one day it will be happening the closer we get towards the end and the end for people might be the rapture but i can tell you this all the stuff in the bible is going to happen it will all happen the tribulation the perilous times it's going to happen christening on the third jerusalem is going to happen for that thousand years satan being taken off the earth during the time is going to happen he'll be back on the earth to tempt all the ones who were born people lived to be seven eight nine hundred years old during that time uh if you died at 100 that would be like a child say timelessness is coming to the earth before them yes it said that there would be a generation of people on the earth that would taste of the powers of the age to come the age to come after this age we're in is the millennial age so he's not done with this one yet it's not going to end okay but there would be people living in your time i'm saying over the next couple hundred years in this time who will be timeless will begin not to age who will travel to the spirit realm all the time rather than the physical realm who do amazing signs and wonders for him that's why he needs this time right now to clean a lot of the evil off of the earth he can't even send new inventions there's inventions that haven't happened yet that will actually make our life so much easier and so different that he won't put them here until the evil is pushed back say god is not willing to give those inventions to the wicked if you see his big picture about all this is happening you will understand why all the evil is being exposed and it's being exposed all over the world why is this happening say god's going to clean that platform off collard so we can step into the greater days of glory that's why if everything had happened is normal and there's all kinds of stuff going on we didn't know if everything had happened as normal on november 3rd then a lot of that would never be found out it wouldn't be known the evil wickedness would still be there hiding plotting and planning and god isn't going to do some things until a lot of them are taken off who understands please raise your hand if you were god and you had great things to send to the earth would you allow all that to remain and you can see just in our country alone how that has interfered you can imagine saying no holds barred for anybody easier than what you want to it would be really hard to have any of that happen right so he does have a plan it is going to we are having justice it will come not just here but around the world and there's be some people here you will see no more see there'll be people here say it wicked people who will be here no more that is his plan amen amen so you're living in different days this is all different our lives have had to be different right it's going to be worth it for what is coming that no man can stop or interfere with and your family member is going to be running to you to find out who jesus christ is there's going to be a lot of salvations happening because people number one are going to know there's a god because only god could do all what's going to be done so on god's timeline we're right there at one of his things right now on his timeline right now we're there so everybody here is born because he needs you here he wants you here okay no one is a mistake no matter how you got here or who he sent you to he never purpose evil for you or harm or tragedy so everybody's seeing enough we're going to do oh we're going to do a soul checkup and i do it for the sake of those who probably wouldn't ever do it this is available to the body of christ to be free of everything that's hindered you hurt you any tragedy anything that happened in your life that you keep having memories of maybe even nightmares about you won't have them no more if you're involved in addictions and you sincerely lose that addiction from your soul he'll come down and pull out of you amen and this is something the father taught me himself it's the first time i actually looked at my clock and then he told me that i'm going to teach you something and i looked at my clock it's all the time when i came back it was four hours later my staff had been beating on my door my daughter come over to see me and i didn't answer anybody my body was there i wasn't there he took me and showed me how he made a human soul why he mean it that way how important it is to understand the fullness of the peace of the kingdom i'm telling you about the keys of the kingdom that's what this is you call it something else he calls it a soul checkup you should do it all the time i used to teach it once and then that was nice and i found out a few weeks later no this is a lifestyle if someone says something horrible bashing hurting to you you turn around loose those words from your soul and him will go and it will be to you like they never happened if you saw traumas if you had tragedies if you lose that tragedy from your soul he'll come down and go shh it'll be like it never happened to you you can talk about it there's no hurt there's no fear there's no suffering no matter what it was you don't have to have that in you he doesn't want it in you his explanation to me was i don't have time for them to have six weeks or six months or six years of therapy i don't have that kind of time i need them free i need them free right now that's why i'm going to teach you this and if you're willing to learn it and train them then i will show you who melchizedek is you give me promises i'll do this for you and i didn't ask him i'll do this for you do this video i'll do this for you and of course you know i said yes i know you'd be the whole world i'd be training that's okay it's the most important thing you probably learn other than knowing jesus christ you can walk through your life with no pain no suffering no fear no grief no traumas no addictions now it may try to come back to you saying nope i got rid of you i'm not taking you back and the devil will try to bring back whatever he can you say nope it's gone and i've done this with too many people for you to try to tell me it doesn't work it does work so if you're a born-again believer you can do this okay so first i always start with we're all going to repent and say father father i come before your throne i come before you i love your son jesus christ i love you right now i'm going to clean up my salt right now i'm going to clean it up i repent of any sin since my original repentance i don't want any of it in me so i'm giving it back to your son i thank you jesus thank you jesus for cleansing my soul for blessing my soul that i can be free of all sin amen amen now we're going to do this soul checkup i will list things that you need to lose from your soul but if i don't say something you can say that yourself and everyone does it so nobody's going to be figured out or pointed out the one thing i will see is stuff leaving you i'ma the seer i will see jesus come down he pulls gray matter out of you that's what it looks like it looks like gray because you have the light of god but if you have darkness in there if you play with sin or play with stuff and the enemy looks in you he will see gray he will go after you he'll already go after you so that's why number one you don't want to keep it right he also doesn't want people bashing screaming yelling because you sound like hell when you do that our words are supposed to bring life yes amen we're here to bring light and love and life those three things that's why you're here so if you have anger issues there's something in your soul that keeps making you do that so you can lose anger from your soul it won't ever come back again don't go watch 10 movies with profanity in them i have to say this about profanity that is hell's language you are literally speaking the language of hell if they hear enough they're going to start showing up because they recognize those words that's why god says no profane word should come out of your mouth there it is right there no profane words should be spoken by you amen it's not in heaven no one in heaven talks like that i've been to hell three times and it was filled that's the only language they speak so we don't want to represent now we're not here for that right and i'm sure you may have good reasons to get angry or upset it says you can be angry and sin not okay don't add that to your list we're not supposed to wound people with our words so please don't bash people when people they say this when people lash out at you they're afraid fear causes people to lash out they'll never admit that they won't even think that but fear makes you lash out that's what happens and i always know that person needs help if they're bashing me they need help and so that's how i look and that's how god has taught me to look at it so we should always be here to help people if people don't like you or they're mean to you please forgive them go in a room forgive them loose all of it out of your soul whatever it is maybe teach little kids do this even little kids if they're if they're bashed at school or bullied at school you as their parent can lay your hand on their head and say as a watcher over their soul i choose to loose from my child's soul all the hateful mean ugly words that were spoken to him today i loose them in jesus name and jesus will come down and pull them out of the soul of the child and those children will act like it never happened you have the right to do that because you're the parent amen so this is something you can live do for the rest of your life when something happens immediately to you that's the best time to do it if you're in grief i understand you miss somebody but don't let that grief still be there a year two years three years five years like don't build like a memorial it's okay to put the pictures on the wall i'm saying don't go in there and reap over them all the time they're in heaven saying please have a life they're up there saying please laugh please let it go please release me some people if your parents or loved ones have died and you're still grieving you need to say these words i choose with my will to release my loved one into the hands of jesus to complete whatever destiny he has for them in heaven when you do that they will hear that in heaven number one it will make them very happy it will remove grief out of you that didn't leave yet okay you don't want a spirit of grief which doesn't go in here but will speak to you all the time about how horrible it was that they died they repeat how they die they don't think about how they died they just know one thing they're happy they're there and people got saved in the last minute are really happy they're there they made a beautiful three-level cabin on the river of wherever in heaven but they may not have a mansion the size of new york city but you know they're not upset with anyone who has something greater because those people that was a reward for their life amen so we're going to say i choose i choose as the believer in jesus christ the believer in jesus christ to lose from my soul every anger purple bashing [Music] i lose [Music] i lose that from my soul every fear every year every i'm trying to think of what the words are some natural words um they'll come in just a minute i lose any fear any oppression any depression any thoughts of suicide i loosen from my soul at least from my soul any hate any vengeance any effects and the unforgiveness and it was spoken against me that i was involved that were spoken against me out wrongfully against me i lose all of that and lose all of that from my soul from my soul jesus name i lose from my soul any pornography any pedophile any wicked defiled things that i looked at before watched they were forced for [Music] and he laughed any poverty any poverty any wealth that was stolen i forgive those people in jesus name i was not made to live i am not keeping it in jesus name can attack me in any of those ways i lose it from my soul in jesus name i lose from my soul any unrighteousness anything it took me beyond what god allows what god loves beyond the boundaries he except for us as believers i lose all that from my soul at least from my soul and he failed and he failed here any thoughts of failure any failed activities or businesses or plans or plays of the enemy he took me out of them i will not i will be associated with failure i am above i am not beneath any thoughts any thoughts of being beneath me i will not keep them against any any hurting crippling crushing controlling words that i spoke over others i boost them from my soul i lose from my soul deep sadness unfounded sadness that has no ground i will not keep that in my soul i was [Music] any deceiving words that were spoken to me or about me that i heard on the news any fake news i would lose from my soul any lies about this time any corruption that i heard spoken i use all of that i will not make judgments from that i loose it all for myself in jesus name any thoughts i've had of being unimportant and not measuring up not being what god wanted me to be those words did not come from god i will not keep those thoughts i will not keep those take them captive loosen from my soul in jesus name and we're going to wait a few minutes while he just pulls all that out and [Music] now we're going to bind the things of god to our soul this is one way you can stay happy every day of your life you choose to be happy you choose to be what god called you to be no matter what's going around you but when those things aren't in you it's much easier but if you want the fullness of god you can ask for more than just your rent being paid food on your table you know things that need to be fixed or hold us fine but he wants you to be more than that you have not because you asked not today we're going to ask to have things bound to our soul when you do that he comes and he puts them in you some of them come in waves i see whole waves of the joy of the lord whole waves of his presence whole waves of his life so we're going to who do you are you all ready to ask for them yes say i choose as an act of my will to bind to my soul my soul the love of god the love of god the life of god the light of god the presence of the lord the joy of the lord his creativity his creativity his expectations yes his validation my gift that he gave this word i will meditate on all the time all the time in jesus name i bind to my soul the goodness of god and it will be evident the life of god and it will come for me the glory of god that we are seated in christ christ in me is the hope of glory that i bind to my soul i bind to my soul his will his plan to release it to the just in the righteousness that promise my mind to my soul by him to my soul sound wisdom extreme discernment i can operate for him the way he needs to be in jesus name so be it [Applause] amen [Music] he has great plans for all of us and it doesn't depend on your age your position doesn't depend on anything but one thing you belong to his son right do you mean that decision to accept christ and his sacrifice i know a lot about things that happened the day that he died on the cross a lot about what happened from the moment his he had his spirit leave his body i think if he hadn't told him to leave he might still be there because he did he commanded the spirit mentally leave his body and his body was taken down it was placed in the tomb god appointed two angels to be with christ through many different times in his life if it said angels came and comforted him it was the same two angels that they were always with and they were with him in the garden they were chosen to bring that cup that cup is a real cup the thing he drank all the wickedness and evil and every sin and wickedness that existed he drank that that's what had to be nailed to the cross it wasn't just his physical body it's what he carried to the cross if people ask you how come jesus is the only one who can forgive sins you tell them that he's the only one to drink all of the evil of every single sin into his being and was willing to nail back to the cross and at that time he can abolish sin in our lives when we repent is the only one who's done that he's the only one who's made that sacrifice willing so he is the only one that has the power to forgive sin and he is the only way back to heaven someone else has another heaven good luck the one i saw belonged to the god of the bible his son jesus christ holy spirit so many angels millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of angels i've seen in heaven around in heaven all over the earth they belong to him amen he made them for specific purposes they're made in tribes like there's tribes of watcher angels tribes of couriers trying of scribes and then there is the army of heaven that is a whole different creature when it talks about the living creatures before the throne of god you're pretty much describing most of the army of heaven they don't look normal they don't look like human eye and they have wings whether you ever see them or not some are made out of just force i can't even explain that they they don't have any kind of shape that you can identify some have eyes some have 30 eyes some have eyes all over their body some have eyes in the front in the back some have two heads front and front i'm not going to explain that hello hello i was present when they brought a gift to my grandson when he was born and he is a carrier of the love of god and he's going to be an athlete who will win olympics and he's focused he's got two things in his life he's so focused i can't figure his brain out he can run faster than his father or anybody who's ever tried to beat him but what he will talk to you about is the love of god he was assigned these two angels who were one being and their names are passion and compassion and they're with him all the time he has other angels who are with him uh his main angel's name is flash your number one angel assigned to you is because of the gift you have mine is about 40 foot tall i've never seen him when i was a little tiny thing i could see him following me around all the time i apologize to him all the time you probably shouldn't have heard me say that i'm sorry then he grins at me sometimes he rolls his eyes at me but not often he's there to protect me to watch over me sometimes he'll bring me things from heaven and but but this grandson's angels always uh oh i know all my brain kids angels actually speak to them hi thank you for watching over them you know they're going to be going here i know you know that but just pay attention and and so yeah the one who's fast is almost the speed of light the first one is the first friends and is very creative he started making trips to him when he was three he seen my dad talk to my dad described my dad he never met my dad on the earth my dad keeps giving his favorite candies candies were around in the 50s that they don't even have anymore he's gone inside of a volcano in heaven and rode the lava hound with my dad he described cars that could drive up the side of mountains without wheels they exist in heaven i never told him about that he's been making trips now for five years and he'll just say the most surprising things come out of his mouth nobody's saying anything he could lead a service baptized so get people saved baptized in water cast demons out they have never been a trim in the public school that was probably a good thing you'd be down the principal's office all the time your son just baptized someone in the water fountain again and he would yeah and the second one is over the love of god will pray for everybody if he sees anyone limp in the store anyway he'll run up to them in jesus name be healed and the third one is a girl and she would be she will dance and sing and there will be weapons she'll be very fierce they should named her middle name fierce and i got two pages on her before she was born one whole one and a half pages of how fierce it she'll be she is fierce she runs for brothers she totally understands things from god she's for sees things here's things her passion to worship surpasses everything else she's got she's all about worship singing and dancing and now she's wanting to learn to play the violin i'm sure that will be very dangerous to hell when she does that because what you do in worship is dangerous against hell your prayers are your worship is however you do that by that's painting danger to how when you sing dance if you flag whatever it is that you do is worship you create images that are captured and taken before the throne of god so she's fierce her angel that protects her is the size of a mountain his name is rock and he's got this little tiny person that he follows around you know i every time i visit wherever they're all at i thank them all the time for watching over them and so i know their names i know what they will be one of my rewards god loves children she needs children you are not just raising a child you are shaping souls to the kingdom and i talk more about the kingdom usually than i do the actual world that's why christ came he came to tell us about the gospel of the kingdom it wasn't just about dying that's just how everything begins with you ruling and reigning in the spirit realm is what he actually has for you you rule with him because he rules we have ultimate authority in this earth over this earth over anything in this earth everything of satan has been put under our feet we have power over all say all the power of the enemy we're going to learn how to use it we are he's starting something new brand new right in the middle of all this time actually gave all the revelation about it on the day of the fake inauguration it will happen the body will learn who they are what your authorities in the spirit realm how to use that authority how to crush darkness push it back it'll be a different life to live in this world amen demons will run from you they won't try to attack you they will try to get away from you because what you carry will cause great pain to them yes the light and the glory of god is painful to the enemy that's why when it showed up in hell on the third day they were screaming their faces were melting they couldn't get away from christ fast enough that is what it's going to be like to live in this world with you so you're not unimportant you're not just a person you're not an old sinner say by grace don't ever say that again you are considered royalty in heaven your manifested sons and daughters of the most high god you are the love of jesus christ life he gave everything for you that's how much he loves you holy spirit can't wait to get to know you better he will share things with you that will probably undo your natural mind because heaven is not this world it's only a shadow earth is a shadow of what is in heaven and what he has waiting for all of us now in this life probably won't be repeated again what he starts now will continue until the end of this age and even those christians who would become christians during the tribulation will be a thorn in the flesh of satan they won't be crying they won't be hiding when it comes time it's going to be executed i've already been shown that they will be dancing in the line which would be the biggest irritation to say who finding things i'm really going to get them now they'll already know they already had trips to heaven by that time a lot of people will be uh it will be normal for people to be caught up to have many times doing greatest some of the greatest things on the earth until things begin to switch okay i cannot tell you for sure that the body will not be on this earth when that happens but i will just repeat what the word says until he that is with hell is removed the antichrist cannot appear on the earth well i can tell you what if we were all here he would be able to do nothing he is not here anywhere in the earth right now god wouldn't be starting these greater days of glory with so much power of god being seen and felt and known in the earth satan would not be able to fulfill his thing his few years his bump in the road that's what god says he gets a bump in the road he won't be able to operate that operate like that in those days people will be looking for a savior someone who can rescue them from the horrific perils times which will also be a short time they will take anybody okay so who shows up is the antichrist and he's actually going to be good for the first three and a half years to fool everybody he only does all the evil stuff the last three and a half years and he still won't get the whole world i don't know why people think he will he won't there's going to be rednecks here that will not want him that will not take satan even during the tribulation and there will be people on the earth when christ comes to sit on the thorn in jerusalem that didn't die even during that time and they will have a long time to make their decision for christ you have still have to get saved even during the time when christ is on the throne and some of those kings how about this want one in there knowing he's the son of god knowing he will actually control the weather and all these other things he will sit as king of the world and they will want in there so the satan is loosed 1 000 years later out of the pit he will have no authority or power in the earth for that 1000 years christ will have holy ruling in the earth there will be people who survive the tribulation that will live here during that time so sometimes you'll understand things sometimes you had a big picture given to you right now we still have a long way to go but at this point in history in heaven and on the earth are the greater days it's not the darker days amen i know some pastors if they don't have revelation and they don't know what's going on they always go to the end this is the tribulation everybody get ready for all this to happen it's not going to happen evil is not taking over this world right now it's actually going to be diminished for a very long time so thank you for letting me share make sure you make it tomorrow i will be talking about america i'll be wearing my red white and blue amen stand up so i can speak a blessing i'll just tell you we have stuff back there you might be interested in i almost never get to share about it but we do have some things i just sincerely want to speak a blessing over your lives if you don't come tomorrow well then i will just speak over you tonight amen raise your hands father i thank you for your children that are here tonight god who paid a price to be here their time their energy their efforts god and right now father i release to this room the healing power of jesus christ whether it is emotional whether it's physical whether it's mental in jesus name i speak wholeness to your bodies to your minds to your spirits in jesus name that you will walk out of your hole totally and completely the way he made you in jesus name and anybody watching online i release that to you also wholeness in your body wholeness in your mind wholeness in your emotions in jesus name and god i ask for specifically those who are here and those watching online god that you give a download of your wealth to each and every person here father a god that you have a desire in your heart you don't have to wait until that great transfer happens father you may show them your goodness by changing their finances in one week god i want to hear reports of the miraculous father the unexpected the suddenlies that are already starting in this world god let it happen to everyone who is present god and everyone who's watching and not because they have to know you love them but because i want you to do it for them i am willing and obedient god and i thank you for a blessing for myself that you will let every single person here experience the unexpected suddenlies from your hand in jesus name i declare it to be so and everyone said amen i receive it thank you amen

of Revelation in this in this place tonight and Lord we welcome the Angels tonight we welcome signs and wonders and miracles in this place tonight [Music] so come a Holy Spirit even now we love you we welcome you in this place thank you Jesus thank you Lord now I feel like the Holy Spirit is this gonna thicken his presence right now there's some of you who have been crying out I gotta have more I'm not satisfied I gotta have more and God has been stirring your heart he's been blowing on the coals of your heart the flames of your heart to ignite it into a mighty blaze and so lo let tonight be that night why wouldn't he do it tonight [Music] Jesus said blessed are the hungry are you guys hungry tonight yeah blessed are those who hunger and thirst come on how many want to be blessed tonight we've got a hunger and thirst for him and for his righteousness and you'll be filled and so Lord fill us tonight we pray or we want to step out of the natural into the supernatural realms of the kingdom of God into that place where all things are possible tonight we pray thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen well welcome good to have you I think we're gonna receive an offering right now if we are the ushers ready so we're gonna receive an offering when a hundred percent goes to Kat Kerr ministries and if you if you're making a check make it to the healing rooms and also if you need use a credit card you could just raise your hand or if you need an envelope we'll give you an envelope for tax purposes just raise your hand so we you get many ways you can give tonight well I don't know about you but I'm really expecting it's been a great day today so far and we haven't seen anything yet and so again we want to welcome you to the Healing Rooms Apostolic Center and you know I I just I always say this because it happens almost every time we meet together you just may be healed it happens in the glory here all the time we have so many angels here on assignment and I just I just got a feeling some of New York and just going to get healed you know a lot of times it happens during worship happens during the word and so we definitely haven't opened heaven and this is a place where miracles happen so when you feel the presence of the Lord we like to say it like this just reach out reach out and touch him and receive your miracle tonight all right it's been excited we were living in supernatural times and this has been a supernatural week I'm sure every here knows that Paul Kane went to be with the Lord last Tuesday evening and today was the afternoon when his body was laid to rest in Santa Maria and just different the signs and wonders happening throughout the week and and so I know that we're in the midst but we're always in the midst of the supernatural but it just seems like something special and so we invited Kat a while ago and of course nobody but God knew that Paul was gonna go home and actually be buried on the first day when she's speaking and I know that it's not a coincidence I don't know exactly what it means maybe she does but I know stuff like that is not just a coincidence so we're really blessed and honored Kat to have you here again and I'm sure how many of you have never been in a live cat care meeting Oh a lot of you good you're in for a treat so why don't you can make your way up Kat you need to come up around this way and yeah you ready oh and while she's coming up somebody dropped their glasses so if that's you you probably can't see but here they are when I put them up here so Kat um well brought those in you don't know the Lord's been taking her to heaven for several years and showing her things and bringing her back and allowing her to share with us so let's just welcome cat Kirk [Applause] Wow [Applause] I know some people know why I'm saying that some may not when the army of heaven goes to battle against the darkness that is their war cry why because they're excited you're gonna crush the enemy's plans over you right they're gonna crush them they're gonna pull down strongholds that have been rising against you that's why they were created news flash from heaven they weren't created to protect heaven they were made by the creator of heaven they didn't get to kick Lucifer and one-third of the angels out then you get to do that Michael hell them and the Father sent a lightning bolt a million megawatts of love from himself and took him out and then one third of angels went out the same way so they've been waiting a long time to war on our behalf full time amen I may or may not give you scripture for that tonight go look it up I think most of us know that Jesus was the lord of state loud the host is the name of the army of heaven yes they're still part of the angel tribes but they're different in many ways the ones under Gabriel have many different positions and jobs in heaven and on the earth and they look more like us they're the ones who look more like us the army of heaven mostly does not look anything like us they're creatures most of them are creatures they're fierce looking they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps so what the Holy Spirit says they're not gonna be pretty boys with harps however there was one time when they had to take the place of the worship angels which were the one-third that were kicked out the only ones Lucifer got were the ones he was over he was over one-third of the angels was the worship angels obviously if he was the one who led them in worship all the time in heaven I'm just gonna give you full out Revelation because I want to take advantage of all the time I have so if you didn't know this he used to step inside God to lead worship he covered over the very heart of God with his wings which were embellished with gems he had gems on his back on his front people go well he had just a few no he had really hundreds of them on him and when God made him he made mountings like in a ring and every gem was mounted and amounting like a ring that you would wear like this one here and he was beautiful which is one of the reasons why he ended up by falling from pride from his beauty also he thought he was smarter than God and that was a that was busted mythbuster it's okay to laugh cuz you're gonna laugh a lot tonight alright heaven laughs every time the devil loses down here all of heaven roars yes they know what's going on and today they were attendants for Paul Cain with Paul Cain not talking about the body talk about his spirit man everyone gets to see their own homecoming isn't that nice so we're colors and play lots of music and dance because that's what they'll be doing in heaven news flash from heaven number two they don't have a funeral in heaven when you come home say Amen you shouldn't expect one we should have a party zone down here when we send people off instead of a funeral home someone opened a party zone I promise you'll make more money than other people with funeral homes cuz even the world will want to send theirs off wherever they think they're going they'll pick a party anybody say Amen so that is a witty idea I've been giving up for years I don't think anybody's done it yet so there you go the more real heaven becomes to the body of people will want to send them off with a real celebration because of the reality of what heaven is and what they're going to be experiencing there it won't make sense to have a sad funeral while they're watching from the party I'm a seer that means I see in the unseen realm okay mister I'm really happy Danny because I got to experience all that heaven was doing and what was going on with Paul Kane and his mother and his sisters you know his family that's up there and the others who were attending up there watching his service he enjoyed every funny thing that was told he likes to be real so he liked all the reality of who he was he liked that personal side of him being talked about so next time you plan a family members homegoing service tell some jokes because they will laugh I was at a service one time and back home and it was um trying to member the guys name I remember told McClellan he was part of story side B and he died suddenly and I came into his service I didn't know anyone but I was coming to bring some books about heaven to his family the Holy Spirit told me to and I saw him watching from the portal that was really difficult you know to try to pretend to be sad and I never wear black it's okay if you if you go to somewhere where they're expecting you know to do what is proper not to upset them but no one's wearing black in heaven they're not and they aren't having to partying there was I saw Ron McClellan thank you my best friend Holy Spirit he makes up for what I don't know you know helps my human head lots of times because they kind of took that away from me I used to be kind of brilliant really then they made me like eight years old life is much easier being that way you know what you don't worry about things you don't think about what's gonna happen five years down the road when you don't even know or you already planned you know prepare for disasters or something I never got that really if we're over the weather then we shouldn't be concerned about the weather we rule over it amen okay she didn't know news bulletins number three writes number three are you keeping track you're gonna get a gift number three Jesus was over the weather we are joint ears we get to be over the weather and that great you're gonna see that more and more I'm serious you're gonna see it more and more things stop like stop can't wait for that to happen meteorologists might have to get another job not making fake news by the way they don't work now and it's not gonna work when it's not actually happening what was I talking about number three boys over over the weather Jesus was over the weather and he tried so hard to teach his disciples he really was in case you didn't know they were in boot camp with him for three years it wasn't just watch what I do it's learn what I do and then do it right he was gonna go he's gonna go back for some R&R and he had to make sure they understood how this whole thing works being a joint heir with Christ what do you have we have he said so himself the things I did how point-blank can you get the things and the works I have done you will do well you forgot the first part you will do also okay these are just the works you got to do the works say we got to do the works then we get to do the greater say it louder okay like you're excited well I don't just try things I actually do them there's a difference I'm just gonna try that means you're not making much of a plan about that right but doing it the works I did you will do they do also and greater works you will do I think that means we're socially doing something we're entering into a busy season a busy season operating in the supernatural not just talking about it a busy season handling the wealth of the wicked not just talking about it a busy season living not just existing doing the more say the more the more is amazing are you getting better I am just as passionate about living holy as I am about being funny and I will tell you I I have to I have to give you both sides of heaven there's two sides in heaven there's holy profound the other whole half of heaven is funny say funny everybody have they've thought for ever and for ages that it would be boring in heaven maybe because all they do is worship let me tell you you stand in front of him it's not boring whether you're staring feeling like you're going to faint melting to the ground you know you feel like you don't have breath in you because of just being near him yeah it is an honor a privilege and amazing when you worship and it's not normal not even worship as normal in heaven you ride on it you create things as you're worshiping him you're creating when you worship given the devil a big black eye and a very bad day when you worship Him you are shredding bashing and crushing his fake little wannabe Kingdom in the second heaven when you worship Him it's amazing from doing one thing for him to honor him to bless him to adore him what destruction you do against the kingdom of darkness that's my favorite second thing I don't do demons I do do Jesus though I love him I honor him I can't do anything without him it's because of him and with him and it is his plan even the pink hair is his plan because he's not boring there's nothing boring about him there's absolutely nothing boring about heaven there's nothing boring about our future that's like in the next few days the more you believe things are real the more real they will become and that is actually a spiritual truth it's a spirit realm truth the more you believe it is real and talk about it being real and write about it being real and actually acting in it being real the more real it's going to become to you it's the original realm it's the eternal realm it's not the temporary realm this is a temporary life for you it's a temporary place to live a temporary to do things because this earth is not eternal I know people have worked it out in their own mind with their head research and they're looking up stuff and sometimes assuming because I've read a lot of translations and someone kind of miss it I know because the Holy Spirit shows me those scriptures then he'll show me 30 scriptures of it being translated I take the word for the value it gives it's real it is for us to repair us to accelerate us to propel us into high places you never dreamed of doing things you never dreamed of we are living examples of the Father Son and Holy Spirit on this earth that's why you're here you here to be like them look like them and act like them I don't see any failure in any of that I don't see hopelessness worthlessness I don't see fear at all one of the first things the Holy Spirit gives me these Kingdom quotes it's what we decided to call him there's so many we don't know what to call and we didn't just say a quote the Holy Spirit is a Kingdom quote was don't let fear interfere that was a good one right teach me never to fear never say never at all in any way fear does not control our life we do not partner with fear he didn't put fear in us when he made us we're supposed to be fearless and timeless everybody should be yelling I receive it say timeless we're supposed to be timeless he said you had to die I'm being serious not funny now serious John didn't have to die did he say no didn't Jesus say to the disciples what is it so in other words he's saying it doesn't matter what they think you probably actually said that he's a character he's the son of God but he is a character the problem with the biggest characters in heaven except for Holy Spirit Holy Spirit has gotten beat by by that much who they called the drama King Jesus is the king of kings Holy Spirit is a drama King you haven't only seen just a little bit of his activity so far waiting to the full fledge release on this earth he's excited he's excited about what's about to happen in us they've been waiting a long time say they've been waiting a long time if I say the word day I mean the Trinity they're not boring none of them they know how to step inside of each other and be one one thing that's how it happens I know I was eight years old father caught me up before the throne and said I'm going to show you how the three can be one and a five-year-old can understand that man's head knowledge has expanded it and expanded it and all kind of could use every other kind of word explaining that you know multiply it whatever you want to call it made it look amazing powerful and hard to understand it's simple they can step inside of each other Jesus said father I pray that one day that they be one even as we are one because he steps inside his father all the time when he was the word he did the same thing I didn't forget I was only on number three bulletins by the way I've got some more I was the least likely person to anyone on this earth would have chosen to do this okay I'm from a tribe like a real one 15 people in an alligator and an iguana innumerable amount of toad frogs and lizards and spiders we grew up with them in our home I had seven brothers what did you think in Florida you add that up that's what that comes to sell your bike to some kid for a pig bring him home wrap him up and close and you have a new pet overnight we never knew what was going to be in our home so I didn't need anyone's opinions I was never part of a group or a clique I had a tribe God did that to kill me I'm a dead person standing before you dead people are wonderful for God to use they're not full of self they don't have their own opinion and the devil cannot use a dead person the more dead you are to yourself the more dangerous you are against hell there are many ways to kill me before I even grew up and you know it doesn't matter I mean I love everyone in this room I loved all my siblings I survived I conquered I was a leader wasn't liked all the time but I was a big help to my parents I honor my parents greatly every day of my life I loved them I didn't want to hurt them they needed help say parents they need help pastors they need more help I'm grateful people can start a church Oh No I've already died I don't need a church I don't need a whole congregations of people although I love them I bless you all but I really bless the pastor because they die every day to be that amen you'll notice that God didn't actually send his son to be a pastor did you ever notice that they actually sent him as a businessman God loves business people they're easy they know how to listen they know how to complete things that are given to them they don't leave things out forget things ignore things they do a job amen so he sent his son as a businessman who could easily connect with the sinners and he did they ate with him all the time they liked him he was exciting he was interesting he was funny his favorite job was to offend the hierarchy he was good at it and yet lived holy did miracles raise the dead they took money from people for spotted lambs they weren't high on God's list and he had to train his disciples I know he only had him for three years and I think most of them finally got it after he left but they did give him credit they did but in the beginning I'm sure Jesus would go to the Father when he went to the mountain all the time and say are you sure I have to that fight all the time they brawl over women I have one who wants to be everything until everybody that that would be Peter I have a treasure you know that cheats all the time right you know that you know he takes money all the time I know you know that too and I have a tax collector and every time you walk down the road to go Minister we get stones thrown at us because they don't like him I don't know anybody who likes tax clusters they didn't back then either so he did not give him the best or the easiest to Train and I know I was saying something to God about my some of my staff and he said I didn't make it easy for my son in my conversation ended with that subject especially when he caught me up me took me back and I got to walk through a whole day of their lives like in their first year of being together all right God I can make it God has a plan for you every single person is important to him and I do know this your birth was timed on this earth God created time he knew you before you were born because you played inside of him he saw you if there was time he saw you all the time how great is see that he was huge he could make himself as big as he wanted to and he walked on the mountains he was out where there was nothing and he spoke and the world would step out of him and make space that God would make himself small enough to step inside himself and play with you he did say he's not a man he's God and even being that great he knew everything about you knew the mistakes knew our faults knew everything that had great hope and great plans for you to do great things so it's no mistake you're here now in this age instead of the ages before this time you're here right on time for the accelerator time for the more of God for the kingdom age for the time to command the hosts of heaven handle the wealth by host cities for him to use because he's not poor he knows the names of your children that you'll have even before you get married he knows them and he put them in your family line on purpose in this generation that's here now this is a special generation for God it's the beginning of the group and type of people that will remain until all things be fulfilled some well the Bible says there'll be a group of people like that a group and type of people a generation that we're generation means a group and type of people it doesn't mean like 30 years or actually that word in the Bible that says Jesus says that there'll be a group and Type O people on earth that will be here when all things be fulfilled including the coming of him that word means a group and type of people that work generation means that there will be a grouping type of people on this earth that also says in the Bible that would taste of the powers say powers of the age to come that would be the Millennial age of course there's people now let's say they're not going to be in millennium I go about what the Bible says there will be a millennium there will be a Tribulation God caused a bump in the road it will happen that's on his timeline in heaven so no matter what other people have come come up with or assume or have putting in translations I promise you it's going to happen and you can't make it happen or not happen anyway so to me it's not worth agreeing over God's gonna work out his plan all the way to the end right I'm excited to know that I'm part of that generation that will tasted the powers of the age to come that's why you need revelation because that that all that comes from the heart of God he already knows what it's going to look like she knows what's gonna happen so he chose you to be here to be a part say Amen that word means so be yet might as well say it gonna happen there's no one on the earth in the earth around the earth say it's round I gotta say that the Holy Spirit won't let it go okay so that's him say the earth is round not flat they don't have edges you may say that property does not have edges there you go Holy Spirit truck can we use proper grammar Ben m8 that's how they say it there is a whole group of people that sincerely spend so much time and money to try to prove the earth is flat I'd rather use that money in that time and energy ruling right I've flown many times and I didn't get halfway around the world then all of a sudden here's the flat earth and I'm flying it didn't all of a sudden go wait shh now you're on the other side no I went around besides I've already been up over the earth it's round God made it round he says he sits on the circle of the earth not the square you'd be surprised how serious they are they think NASA has spent billions of dollars faking it and none of that stuff is real I don't know who got that thought but it didn't come from heaven a man so just rest assured that it's around okay been there seen that it is round and when I almost shown it God caught me up in space up and do like like first space not I've been way up there but the first time he caught me up and showed me the earth he put a grid you know like a grid you know what that is yeah a grid was round and he put it right on the earth cheol-ho together and then they begin to draw things on this grid that was his plan that was called space planning that was also the Holy Spirit's joke he's out in space put the grid than planned right uses every opportunity to be funny so he did show me his space planning for like the next hundred years that was probably 15 20 years ago when he showed me that that doesn't mean the earth is going to end in a hundred years except been taken further than that and no tribulation had happened I know some people think it's supposed to be right now well if it was it would be people get to heaven they all find out man we wasted so much time sitting on our rapture rug she to roll it up put it in the closet well you've you've been around a long time you realize I went to church everyday it was open and every day someone said Jesus could come tomorrow and in my I'm like little this is like little I had these thoughts why would he have all these plans in the Bible and go okay not forget that we're just all going home I mean he gave my dad a long plan I mean my dad knew him he gave him a long plan I mean he's not going to where we haven't done what God told us to do yet and God said well many people are in fear and they know one day that will happen so they want it to come so to them that's logical they don't understand a lot especially in the book of Revelation say revelations means revelations that means something you don't know so God said I'm calling you a Revelator me you know why he did that so people couldn't call me a false prophet they don't know what a Revelator is so they didn't never say nothing against it they couldn't say well she's not a terrible pastor no he can't call an evangelist she doesn't go out and win lots of millions we can't call her that huh can't call her prophet she's a Revelator don't know what that is so we'll ignore all of that a Revelator is someone who reveals like John did caught up showing the future the future no know what that was that was a bling glitch write that down and don't forget it I know Jen is writing it down right now if I say word she goes you did a bling glitch that means you blended some words together okay I won't explain it yes you've been there I'm sure people been there right you've been there well at least I'm not talking about noses putting the animals on the art tonight that's Moses and Noah doing it together when Donna even said Adam did it I did hear from people I have a bloopers thing one day and just put them all on there go there and look at it but now I forget we're talking about who is listening Revelator you're right so see I hear them all the time I have to fight when you're eight you need help so he didn't pick me to be a professor you know I was graduated middle of my class like literally middle we had six hundred graduating students we have a lot of people coming to Florida to go to school I guess they like it we're pretty laid-back there you know and so it's a nice place to live if you want to come live someplace different go good vacation time try not to come in August really hot so being a Revelator's a little bit different that usually doesn't mean profit just so you've wondered you know John was a men and it's okay I love doing that but I love being with my father my heavenly father him all the time I know why Jesus loved him so much I know why he wanted to be with him I know why he went away to the mountain to spend time with him I know how hard it was for him to leave home and come here okay he was not poor he didn't live poor say Jesus was not poor he became poor when he left heaven because heaven is certainly not poor there's nothing poor up there nothing splendor and wandering beauty you couldn't afford to build the house that you're mentioned that your mother lives in you wouldn't even have the right substances to make it the walls sing literally they sing they leave you go on tours come back they sing hello to them the trees uproot their self and they come and sit in your house and be your friend for a while they'll go back to the friendly forest is this ok it's not gonna be normal no you can't be normal you've been going to heaven for 20 years you be normal to heaven they tell funny stories a lot Bob Jones hasn't stopped most people when they go there no matter how they were here they're all happy they love jokes they love to tell funny stories hear funny stories they love it they make plans for people before they come they knew Paul was coming they all knew Paul is coming there's a place you go in heaven where you find that out and you go in this beautiful amazing building and these supernatural monitors much better than ours but these are good and you can see who's coming home who's about to come home to heaven everybody starts getting things ready they're so excited they're there beside their self they want to make sure they're all there say all to meet you at the gate they have a huge celebration they plan one themselves heaven plans one the throne room plans one people have celebrations in the street over someone coming home stay home it's because that's where you came from we were alone to the earth for a while when you go home you are really home and you're not dead they don't throw parties for people who aren't alive they have huge celebrations lots of music lots of food everyone meeting one another visiting Jesus welcomes you if he isn't taking you himself sometimes he does take people he comes into his own chariot flaming horses picks you up and takes you up to heaven then when you get out you see the sea or the mass of people waiting to greet you and then Jesus walks you up the steps of the throne to give you back to the Father and then the father reaches out of that glory that moves in and out of him the Living colors of the bow coming in and out his eyes flames of fire passion for you just glowing and he reaches his arms out and grabs you he says welcome home my son welcome home my daughter you go home as his children say we are his offspring every morning gets their own mansion you don't have to share it with your brother or sister I'll have my own one day it's made exactly the way you would love it but it's made with his presence in the walls and the floors and it's not gonna be a normal shape trust me it's not all your pets to be there they'll be waiting to greet you eating your food at your table your family members will all have gifts for you for every year you've been apart they will get a gift that represents that year and put it in your mansion after your welcome home party in the throne room which could last for quite a while your family will come get you and take you to your own mansion then they'll have another celebration everybody laughs and filled with joy to see all the ones they loved before little tiny babies they never got to raise they get their children given to them to raise the same one that you that didn't make it all the way through amen God keeps them they live with your grandparents or whoever when they get there they'll go get them and help raise them for a while I love the story of a mother they lost their son he was either 7 or 8 he was hit by a car and they of course they they grieved over him but knew he was in heaven and I think it was like 20 years later or 30 years later one of the other huh she died on the operating table and was caught up to heaven saw her seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold he goes mom Wow mom you're here this is so exciting your mom I'm so glad you're here and you cuz what have you been doing goes I've been playing with my friends what you think I've been doing he's been living with his grandfather and playing with all these friends and the streets to go they were playing and he was laughing and he said but you can't come yet because it's not your time and so she came back never forgot it and her and her husband went around the world talking about it you will be known as you are known except you look better like a whole lot better you'll have hair most guys wear their hair about down to their shoulders don't have you know that's gonna change y'all I'm just letting you know I can't change guys unless you really want like a buzz cut or something no Marine Corps or my husband may still have one I would might be surprised to see him alive yeah he's still with me by the way another way to kill me but that was okay it's all worth everything it's worth it all no matter what you surrender give up miss doing it's worth it and you'll be so happy when you stand before God and you're welcomed home knowing that you gave everything you could not saying you have to walk around poor okay that was the devil's plan not God's his plan is to bless us say bless us and prosper us it'll be worth it some people have already seen Jesus here right how many people have seen Jesus let me see either in a vision or dream or in reality if you've seen him how many people have been encountered an angel there's usually a lot there's a lot of people here it's going to happen that's part of the acceleration that's part of the more it's a lot of them more actually that we will see angels and they will probably be talking to us they came from God ignore what we've all been told our whole lives don't talk to angels they did in the Bible amen there's gonna be a lot more of that angelic not just visitation because what we're going to experience is the habitation heavens not coming for a visit a heaven is not coming for a visit they're coming for a habitation you're part of the habitation you are all of you sitting here say I'm alive and breathing I'm part of the habitation but God is about to do on this earth does not just take a territory here and there what the habitation will be is in us say in us that's the part of the habitation that's why me and won't be able to control it like they have in the past say God will be in charge it's a habitation and it will remain for a long time he's gonna transform this world right now he is shifting government so he can shape Nations it's part of the platform he's giving us in the habitation he's got platforms for us that's the place that we will operate from and speak from shake things cause things to be released to change for him it's not a lot of how it's always been in the past that's why it's a new thing say a new thing it's time for the new thing it's where we will be ruling it's one of the purposes that Christ died for us that's why he went into hell and wasted it took back the authority and Dominion the Adam had given away he gave it to us he also gave his power over all the power of the enemy say we have power over all the power of the enemy say he did not give that to the Angels that's why we need to command them they can't just go tear up any demon they see they just can't do that they do it in in the past it was from answers to prayer and prayers never going to go away it's never gonna go away he loves prayer prayer is powerful it's gonna get even more powerful especially when you command part of an army of heaven and they pull down strongholds for you and crush the plains of darkness we need this say we need it to rule in this day say every King gets the Kingdom and gets an army if we're part of the kingdom we get part of the army did you ever see a king a natural King on this earth title rule with that one they wouldn't go very far with a they'd be overrun beaten up things stolen things killed someone's like the devil he comes to kill steal and destroy that's what the army prevents heavens army was designed created and made every one of them unique and different but they are fierce they have one job the ones under Gabriel have many different jobs many different positions to do many different things but but Michael is over one specific part and that is the army they have a headquarters they have barracks they have training fields they're all in the sky of heaven Rand maneuvers for ages in the past Jesus would go send up Michael to gather the army from the far ends of heaven to fight on behalf of Israel people say Amen it's in the Bible go read it sometimes they even fought the flesh did you know that yeah some of them could fight the flesh in this time on earth it's mostly battles in the spirit battling the demonic even those in the high places the principalities and the powers the things the beings in wickedness in high places many of those high places will be shredded and pulled down say our weapons they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds that's one of the things the army does I can only share what I have been told and I can only tell you what I have been shown shown and told that's what I talk about but they didn't just show me things and tell me things I had to live it every way something mom is trained in it was for the body of Christ so I had to live it to let you know it's real and it really does work she follow heavens protocol see on earth as it is in heaven that's what we've been asking for for generations we should have expected it jesus bushwhacked us all he did he told me is it I knew if I taught them that and said you say that eventually it would come you mean one thing I could get them to agree on no matter what denomination they rod to clear that prayer because they need us to call things in is that right you have not because you ask not if you've ever said to Jesus I'll give you anything you want no matter what it is where it is what time it is I give you permission to use me as anyone ever says something like that let me see your hands well I'll get ready because he's calling in those words yes it's gonna be amazing say amazing heaven is amazing it's gonna be amazing here we can live on earth like they live in heaven which is mainly his will being done his way say his way not our way that's part of the more she's gonna do new thing he goes revelation and then ways for you to use that revelation it means a lot of things are gonna change so if you're stuck in your own mind or your own mindset of what you think is gonna happen and because it didn't it's not going to you need to just so that away because he does have a timeline in his own throne room and those dots on that timeline is when his things are going to happen regardless of what anybody on the earth is doing it's his sovereign will and what right now this time we're in it's on his timeline it is many of the generals are going home doesn't mean they'll be oblivious to what we're doing that means they'll know all about it after they get there and the thing they'll be celebrating is us who are still down here being a part of it so God really needs us right now he's intimidating me although I probably would have never chosen except when he asked me I said yes say it's important to say yes to being chosen many are called but few are chosen because they don't choose that's why many aren't chosen he can't make you do it right you're called you're being called but he can't make you do that you have to choose yes and when you do that you're saying yes I want to be chosen and then you're chosen what does it take to be chosen say choose yes then you got to be willing he makes it a little bit you know gotta be willing and obedient say willing obedience next say surrender is not control a lot of people think it is because you know God does have he does have I'm trying to think of the natural earthward it's like not there he does have guidelines is that right even Jesus had them that he operated by Jesus didn't just pick things on his own all the time where did he say I do yeah what his father said right but he showed him and what he told him that's what he did that's why we need revelation otherwise we're gonna get man's mind set on everything and that hasn't worked well has it he's not going to abandon the church I've heard all kinds of things when people's gonna abandon the church it's just gonna go away burn down we don't need it anymore let's get rid of it when he's not saying that to me he's going to set it on fire amen this is a time to be willing and obedient if you want to eat the fat of the land and Jesus did ask us to pray about one other thing pray that my people say we are his people be willing and the day of his power well obviously if he's going to give us revelation to operate like he does and part of that is power he says he'll give you power over all the part of the enemy there's one right there he's given us power and he does have power so if this is the day of his power the biggest thing the most important thing is remember the willing and obedient thing what he asked probably won't seem natural or normal to you wasn't natural normal to ask me to have pink hair I wasn't a pink haired person I liked it he wouldn't have asked me it's better than camel hair I like pink here any day over camel hair it smells it's stiff not comfortable and he had to wrap himself in it okay my pink hair is a test it divides asunder the Spirit from the flesh so those who trash or bash it or in the flash are we still so walking the flash say no we're supposed to walk in the so people don't have to tell me if they're hearing their flesh or hearing their spirit it's the way they react to the pink care now people who like pink hair they think is amazing so the world must be passing their tests because they all love it that's amazing you look amazing what do you do I'm a spokesperson for haven't I've been there and then they all say the same thing they don't say you're liar your father's property was that they go what was it like what was it like is it beautiful is it amazing is it real is is God real is there a god and go oh yes there is a God and you lived inside of him before you came here okay that makes him interested not bashing amen try that next time you did live in him you moved in and out of him he was your very existence you had your very existence in him that's why he knew you that's why he saw you before he sent you here you're wonderfully and perfectly made your souls were the most amazing parts of you of all you change your very life by what you feed it you change how you feel about things by what you say yourself if you don't like you then change change what you're saying change what you're watching change what you let other people say around you because you need to guard your heart what goes in there is what you will become amen if you've never heard that before it's Revelation on your soul your soul is what you are people say well I'm missing that no Adam became a living Saint loud he became a living soul that's how important it is to God that's why he gave you a soul you could choose yourself you could choose with your will you can think about things choose it and then you do it and then your emotions display who and what you believe with your life it's probably one of the least talked about things in the church it's a soul growing up I always heard that it was bad and went but God made it right he it's one third of us is that right we'll always have our soul why would he make it bad it's a powerful thing and it's a good thing because you can feel yourself with God and then you'll be like him you can talk about him then you really believe he is real you can feed your soul 24 hours a day your body gets fed a few times a day your spirit man gets fed once a week most people go to church once a week but your souls fed all the time by what you watch what you say what people say to you you can be crushed by tragedies and you can't you can't forget it you hang on to it somebody you wound and hurt eunuch stays there forever your soul has layers and it collects things in those layers that's why you have a memory but your layers are supposed to be used for different something different than that every layer of you looks like you who wants revelation on the soul let me see your hand I was shown one and the father spent four hours with me earth time I never usually know but I looked at my clock and I was talking to him then he just catches me up and begins to show me a human soul what it look like how he made it why did he make it that way how people can cause her soul to prosper all the time and then they live in divine health there was a requirement about that prospering it says even as your soul prospers you will prosper and you will be in health that where B means lib it's called divine health so I since I learned about the father taught me about that he said people can loose with the keys of the kingdom you can loose things out of your soul when you loose it it's gone and that doesn't matter what it is he started giving me this very long list of things that you can loose from your soul and he said I know most people buying the devil but the keys to the kingdom but they mostly never talked about the loosing thing what are gonna do with the loosing key and yet the binding key is more important to bind the things of God to your soul because then they can't be taken away what you choose to bind to your soul about God will never be taken from you and so people I know you know if you still want to bind the devil go ahead and do it I'd rather loose the stuff out of my soul that he tried putting there you know if you have an anger issue in your anger anger angry all the time you don't even know you're just angry it's all it comes out of you it's in your soul you choose with your will to loose that's that anger then heaven comes down and they pull it out saywhat sluiced on earth is loosed in heaven you know how amazing you would be if you didn't have all that junk in there especially wounds and wounds can keep you from the things of God as much as sin can don't leave a wound in you because then the enemy will come and try to use it amen so tomorrow night not tonight we're gonna do a soul checkup I hope you're coming who's coming tomorrow night hope everybody's coming home you don't want to miss tomorrow night this is just the introduction we're gonna do some spiritual warfare with the hosts they'll be excited you mean leaving an army if you don't have one they were made for us amen they won't let you worship them they don't have time for that and neither do you amen tomorrow night we're gonna have some fire sent the Angels already outside waiting but they're gonna do that tomorrow night I did this recently where I mean people were literally flaming like they were flaming because this is time just darkening I want to say drops of it the fire of God is amazing it comes from himself inside him say our God is a consuming fire I'm about to get consumed it's one of the most asked asked things by the body of Christ send the fire I want the fire give me the fire let me be consumed let me burn for you it burns everything off the walls of your heart I mean literally make sure your heart white you are filled with boldness like you've never had before in your life you're fearless you're bold you you got filled with God the fire it burns it out then he puts him in selves in there he heaps more stones of fire inside of you those came from God two stones a fire I find a one translation said that they were they were flaming stones that Satan left on some other planet that was in a Bible and I already knew what they were so God made me look up like 29 different translations to go see what they say it is like they missed that one no they didn't ever belong to Lucifer okay they were inside God or he burns with this fire for you under the water they burn in the River of Life that's in him the river flows out of him the gemstones flow out of him even the steps of the throne room have gemstones they flow out of heaven and become the crystal see is called the crystal see because there's gemstones in it not sand that's why it's cut crystal faceted gemstones they're all over heaven they all come from one place when the father and the firewood burn inside of him and Lucifer would step in and there's his holy mountain inside God say God is not a man he doesn't look the same inside that we do but we lived there that's why we like sparkly things way back in our way back in our spirit man we remember that we met we remember that there's something that connects when we look at something that's brilliant and beautiful gemstones represent the love of God his love his revelation upon this rock I know he said Peter was a rock when God says rock in the Bible he's talking about a gemstone you know that white rock that white rock rock or stone you're gonna get when you go home to heaven and there's a name under the only he and you know it's a white diamond it's not a River Rock every syllabus I ever saw showed a river rock when it talked about that that stone so inside his eternity you never see at the end there's no end inside of him no end and we ran up and down this mountain and we slid down the river of life and would jump on the stones of fire through the flames we lived in those flames you're about to get baptized with him it's amazing I don't even know what time it is I better check what time is it oh my my see gem she's at it you didn't finish talking about Ron McClellan remember I was at his service right and I can I come in with these books in his parents and grandparents are sitting on the front row I didn't know him so but I knew a couple people there at celebration Church they let me come in and I just was going to wait till everything was over and they were everybody with their line going by the casket and he had this bright yellow suit on I mean bright with his big white tie and and he had the biggest fro I've ever seen on a human they had to stick it down in the casket and as I was walking I was walking up I looked up I was trying not to laugh out loud because it was an open portal and he was watching his service and now this is a band right band in a van travelling telling jokes non-stop doing sock puppets you know crazy stuff he did crazy things in the van with the guys and his band was there and they were telling the funniest stories and every time they say something funny he would go like this is here we go so here I'm looking at the casket and then I look up there he was alive for now and there was a lot of funny stories right so I'm like this is just this crazy it was so much fun and so I went back sat down and then it came up when I gave out the books and I didn't know who his parents were I knew who his wife was and her mom dad were there and I gave them one and I didn't know that was his father sitting there so I was telling you know his wife this is a book about heaven I really think it a bless you and I started to turn away and and the Holy Spirit to tell me take an extra one so of course willing and obedient I had an extra one in a little bag wondering who was gonna give it to and he grabbed my arm II said did you say that book was about heaven I said yes I I've been there he says can I have that book and I said yes yes you can have and he goes well I'm Randstad well was then this was for you because I didn't know you were gonna be here but he told me to bring it so this is your book and a few months later I get a phone call it's always in the middle of night and it's his parents and they're undone they were so full of joy in celebration after reading about what heaven was like they already knew what their son would be doing having a band and he does have a man and it's called the other side of the story his heaven he went from story side be to the other side of the story that was his bayum but in the band angels were playing and singing with him because he said he wouldn't let anyone take the place of his band when they came to heaven which I told their band and so his parents called they were really excited about everything and and then I they gave me their daughter's phone number he and his sister were really close together and so I called and just spoke to her for a few minutes and and then about I don't know it was probably a year later she called me she goes today is my birthday my 30th birthday and I just wanted to know does my brother even remember me does he still think about me because we had planned a big celebration on this day we didn't know he'd go home so I while she's on the phone to me God caught me up to heaven and I saw her brother standing at a portal this goes sound wild but it didn't matter he was throwing Cheetos at her from the portal and he was singing the worst rendition of happy birthday I've ever heard and this is a guy who sings sent was singing for a living right like me and this that's awful that's awful and then God sends me back and I'm she's still going on the phone I said wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait I got to you hey I don't know what you can think about this but I got to tell you what what I just saw in heaven I saw your brother and he was throwing Cheetos over the portal at you and she starts to yell and scream she goes that that's she said he even had a throw by he run by what do you want a Cheeto throwing whatever he had her fro to so he said his greatest thing to do was run through the room and throw as many Cheetos in her fro that would stick there and she said he did it all the time and I was so irritated but now it's the most precious thing in the world that you told me that because I know he didn't forget me this is on her birthday remember and I said oh I don't know how to tell you this but he he sounded the worst I have ever heard for someone who's anointed to sing she said was it the worst happy birthday you ever heard in your life I want ya she said he did that every year too so she was so blessed to find out she that he had not changed he still remembered her he was still himself and she was so blessed by that so now if Jen there Jen I finished the story I'm done with okay so I want to encourage you to understand that your family still loves you no one has forgotten you they're making plans for you in this little vapor of time that we're in right now on this earth use it powerfully to love to forgive and to be willing and obedient understand John his last message loved one another that should be the thing we do the most amen don't forget to love if you get a choice forgive people who are bashing you when you do that it really does wound the demons and it is our time to torment the Nieman's say it's our honor and privilege to torment the demons those demons ask Jesus have you come to torment just before our time that meant that was going to be a time when they would be tormented is that right but he didn't do that he gave us power right so stand up for a minute I'm sure that Paul is still enjoying his celebration party it goes on for quite a while I know that has something spent planned for him for anyone who ever wanders he made it no matter what you thought about his life or consider for him he loved God he had Christ in his heart he made mistakes he repented for them amen and he's highly honored and recognized in heaven for what he did for God and they're happy to have him home and so is his mom amen so let's make a declaration I love to make declarations say father thank you for timing my birth on the earth for right now I expect to receive the more to live in the more to be the more it is my commission I'm saying yes right now I want to be chosen help me to be willing and obedient and laugh while I do it I asked for and receive lots of fun I need fun heaven has fun on earth as it is in heaven I want to be dangerous against hell the enemy is my doormat but I am a ruler with Jesus Christ I am royalty I am your son or daughter this is the time I've been waiting for amen amen sit down do people have children here okay yeah I don't want to run too late that I don't get to lay hands on them if you have children so maybe in a few minutes I don't know what time do they pick them up okay wherever they are okay yeah I really want you given I know I'm gonna do an impartation tomorrow night I really would like to do one tonight I [Applause] think instead of talking for another 45 minutes I'd rather do that amen so I'm guest tonight because tomorrow night I'm probably getting the lightning power God last time I did it John G showed up that's who I call John G Lake he did he came and stood right next to me other seers saw him it was really zap BAM time but tonight I really want to give out a measure of the fire amen I've had a measure of baptism and fire and let me tell you I've not ever been the same so I want you to take it home with you let it burn on the inside of you don't let the fire go out what you're really doing is preparing a place for more to come say more say when I receive some of something from God I can have more I know there's major things that are about to happen in your lives shifts because this is the time to shift there's a lot of shifts the other thing is suddenly those are two different things a suddenly comes when you least expect it but just one suddenly can change your life it will fill you so full of faith when God moves his hand for you it's always a good thing say suddenly are good things because God is preparing you to receive more of him amen suddenly just send you over the edge probably about half the time suddenly czar about finances or wealth like a lot not like wow someone gave me a hundred dollars like a lot we've had quite a few sudden ease ourselves so I'm asking God to give you some of those also amen so when I when I heart fire to you I'm gonna add suddenly okay say I want the Sun lease say I expect them I'm getting ready for them I'm serious I really wanted God I'm a suddenly son or daughter so send it there you go now you set yourself up so I just want to get ready to lay hands on people it doesn't matter how old you are you can have a suddenly and you can also have the fiery men I see some kids running around they're gonna be fierce I'm talking about children yeah I have several grandchildren that already are fierce so I expect them to be fierce amen say fierce is a good word in this more time of God it's passionate remember the word says we take it by force so don't do don't be mediocre don't be lukewarm you have to take it by force amen in the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven stirs up and encourages for us to be fierce amen and dangerous and violent say violence in the spirit realm is a good thing when we have it that word suffers does not mean that heavens being beat up by somebody however back to the translations God said go read some of the translations and see how they have translated or interpreted that verse from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take up by force and it literally said people are running into heaven and stealing things I don't know where they got that heaven is under attack no I don't believe that for a second it's us who are supposed to be violently passionate against the enemy and we had the right to take back whatever he has taken from us because he had no right to it Amen I love giving revelation in the word - it actually makes sense amen training up your child and the gift God put in them whether it's a drummer or a baker or an interior designer in the never depart from that gift because they'll be doing the thing they love the most that word in there says train up a child in the Ben or the way he made them that means who he sent you as what gift he made you and sent you here every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights and God said everybody sits on the few of the chair every Sunday trying to figure out what their spiritual gift is but one of the most important gifts he gave you is your natural gift your passion what you love what he made you to be or do in this earth that's not your job it's the thing you're the most passionate about you know your child is a drummer if they beat everything everything they have they beat on the table with it you know straw spoons forks whatever it is you buy them a farm you know the farm is set for Christmas and they pick them up and start beating on something with them the cow and the horse here they go take them in a restaurant they use the straws take them outside so they'll be quiet and then they break branches off the bush and start drumming with the bush say I think they're a drummer so raise them up as a drummer and they'll never run around the world trying to figure out who they are does that scripture make sense it's a revelation that's how important your natural gift is because when you go to heaven he plans to use it it's irrevocable you meant to be a baker make the best brownies or whatever it is you make everybody in the neighborhood loves them that everybody tells you to sell them when you go home to heaven you're going to make that and everybody will have it for free and everybody will love you they have rodeos amusement parks because people have gifts that do that is that right that's why we have fun in heaven and it's so natural they walk in heaven and here's all the stuff they need to design and to put together something that won't take forever to make it you're gonna be a baker as part of your mansion you have a full out kitchen with supernatural devices to use and all the supplies you need and then out in the front you have a bakery where everybody comes body your stuff Jesus will visit you regularly he has a sweet tooth that's why he liked honeycomb remember we served on the beach to his disciples remember he served him a meal he gave them what fish and say honey when it is cousin eat locusts and it ran in the family say I'm in the family now I know why I have a sweet tooth amen okay we're going to we're going to do this amen so I guess you can get people organized unless I tell everybody to come one row at a time and I'm gonna come down here you're gonna walk up to me I'm gonna just zap you with the fire God and then what do you want them to do next you want him to come and sit yeah Margaret stone I couldn't do this without mark or actually my team really I have a team I have like 15 people now I don't do this by myself amen every now and then I go okay I'm sending you this time you get up on the platform and speak and so I really do bless my team God gave me man using teams in this time the day the lone ranger is coming to a close amen we're going to need each other we're gonna work together amen and so I'm gonna give this microphone to somebody and then we'll come down here and lay hands on you don't forget to come tomorrow night it's gonna be amazing exciting walk sideways you'll never fall and then I'm gonna declare of declare our blessing over you when we're when we're done okay unless I should do it first because I don't know what you
